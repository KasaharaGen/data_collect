10.1002/advs.202504601,A Tailored Artificial Biocatalyst for Bacterial Endophthalmitis Therapy via Enhanced Ferroptosis-Like Death.,"Bacterial endophthalmitis is an ophthalmological emergency that can lead to permanent blindness, and high-efficiency therapeutic strategies that can completely eradicate pathogens within a short timeframe are needed. However, intrinsic limitations of this disease, such as low administration frequency and dosage, render most currently available nano-antibacterial strategies inapplicable. To address this challenge, a bio-targeted catalytic strategy that is based on a bacteria-specific artificial biocatalyst (MoS<sub>2</sub>/Fe@mercaptophenylboronic acid@hyaluronic acid, MFBH) and suitable for treating bacterial endophthalmitis is proposed. The results show that MFBH exhibits high-efficiency peptidoglycan-targeted catalytic antibacterial capacity against both standard and clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Notably, the in vivo results demonstrate that MFBH achieves effective treatment of bacterial endophthalmitis at an extremely low dose (≈4 µg kg<sup>-1</sup>) via a single intravitreal injection without causing retinal damage. Importantly, the therapeutic efficacy of MFBH is comparable to that of vancomycin. Mechanistic analysis reveals that MFBH induces enhanced ferroptosis-like bacterial killing by accelerating reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst. Further investigations show that the generation of abundant ROS is closely associated with the sulfur vacancies and exposed of reactive Mo<sup>4+</sup> on the surface of the prepared artificial biocatalyst. In summary, this bacteria-specific artificial biocatalyst provides a promising strategy for treating endophthalmitis.","Bacterial endophthalmitis is an ophthalmological emergency that can lead to permanent blindness, and high-efficiency therapeutic strategies that can completely eradicate pathogens within a short timeframe are needed.

10.1080/2162402x.2025.2514040,Combining local cytokine delivery and systemic immunization with recombinant artLCMV boosts antitumor efficacy in several preclinical tumor models.,"Among the plethora of cancer immune evasion mechanisms, T-cell-inhibiting factors within the tumor microenvironment impose a major challenge for the development of novel immunotherapies. Strategies to overcome immunosuppression and remodel the TME are therefore urgently needed. Therapeutic cancer vaccines based on engineered arenaviruses have been proven to generate potent tumor specific CD8+ T-cell responses in preclinical models and cancer patients. Despite signs of clinical activity as monotherapy, combination therapies are needed to further increase the therapeutic effect. To address this need, we evaluated the efficacy of recombinant vectors based on lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus encoding the T-cell stimulating cytokines IL-7, IL-12 and IL-15 with or without tumor-associated antigens. These vectors were tested in three different mouse tumor models (TC-1, MC-38 and B16.F10). Our results demonstrate that only IL-12 encoding vectors led to increased immunogenicity and efficacy, which, after systemic administration, was associated with adverse events. The safest and most potent regimen consisted of systemic vaccination with tumor antigen encoding vectors and local injection of IL-12-encoding vectors. A single round of this treatment regimen resulted in 86-100% tumor-free mice and warrants further investigation.","Among the plethora of cancer immune evasion mechanisms, T-cell-inhibiting factors within the tumor microenvironment impose a major challenge for the development of novel immunotherapies.

10.1111/tid.70060,Transplant Infectious Disease Training: Bridging the Gap.,"An increasing complexity of organ transplantation, newer immunosuppressives, and an expanded donor pool requires a well-trained multidisciplinary workforce with surgeons, physicians, and infectious diseases (ID) physicians working together. In most countries, solid organ transplantation preceded the development of ID as a specialty leading to a lag in transplant infectious diseases (TID) physicians being a member of this team. This gap is further widened in low middle-income countries (LMIC) like India, where there is a dearth of laboratory facilities, which are essential for pretransplant screening and diagnosis of posttransplant infections. India though an LMIC does large volumes of organ and bone marrow transplantations. This article examines the current state of ID and TID training in India with an emphasis on the need for a structured and standardized educational pathway for future transplant professionals. Drawing on examples from existing programs and workforce data using a qualitative survey, we identify paramount challenges such as inconsistent exposure during medical and surgical training, limited access to transplant-specific education, and insufficient support for career development in transplant-related specialties. We propose a strategic framework to address these challenges with an emphasis on early exposure, interprofessional education, mentorship, and the integration of transplant content within undergraduate and postgraduate curricula. By encouraging a comprehensive national strategy, we aspire to bridge this training gap, ensuring workforce sustainability and ultimately improving patient outcomes for those awaiting transplantation.","An increasing complexity of organ transplantation, newer immunosuppressives, and an expanded donor pool requires a well-trained multidisciplinary workforce with surgeons, physicians, and infectious diseases (ID) physicians working together.

There is currently a lack of genomic data on AMR organisms in the Pacific region. We aimed to address this gap by examining the genetic diversity of a collection of 788 Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates collected between July 2020 and October 2022 from a single hospital in Suva, Fiji. We sampled sensitive and resistant isolates, focusing on 3GCR and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negatives, and methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus</i> and vancomycin-resistant <i>Enterococcus</i>. We detected 29 distinct species across 12 different genera. Amongst Gram-negative genomes, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> were the most common. Carbapenem resistance was mostly detected in <i>A. baumannii</i> ST2 and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> ST773, with both STs carrying NDM-1 and showing evidence of transmission within Fiji. Carbapenem resistance was relatively rare amongst the Enterobacterales; however, we observed evidence of transmission of OXA-232-carrying <i>K. pneumoniae</i> ST395 and NDM-7 <i>E. coli</i> ST410. For Gram-positive bacteria, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> ST1 was the dominant clone, and phylogenetic analysis revealed a single clade harbouring the majority of Fijian genomes, with close relationships to genomes from neighbouring Samoa. <i>Enterococcus</i> was relatively rare, with only 22 genomes detected. This study provides crucial genomic data on AMR organisms in Fiji, highlighting the diversity of resistant species in the region. Local transmission of four carbapenem-resistant clones within Fiji was observed, underscoring the importance of local spread of these resistant strains.","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health threat, with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (3GCR) and carbapenem-resistant infections of particular concern.

The distribution characteristics of CR-GNB and antimicrobial resistance patterns among inpatients from 2019 to 2024 were investigated. The detection rate, departmental distribution, annual trends, and drug susceptibility profiles of key carbapenem-resistant bacterial species were compared. A total of 34, 370 patients infected with GNB were investigated, with 2967 cases identified as CR-GNB. Among these, the nosocomial infection rate of carbapenem-resistant <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> (CRE), carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB), and carbapenem-resistant <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (CRPA) were 33.11%, 44.02%, and 22.87%, respectively. The positivity rate for CR-GNB among male patients was 72.94%, with the vast majority of these infected patients (71.88%) aged 65 and above. In 2021, notable shifts in hospital infection control concerning CR-GNB were observed, with a reduction of over 40% in CRAB infection rates and a decline of over 35% in CRPA infection rates. The top three clinical departments with CR-GNB detection were the intensive care unit (ICU), intensive rehabilitation ward (HDU), and emergency ward. CR-GNB accounted for the largest proportion of respiratory infections (73.49%). Clinically isolated CR-GNB exhibited pan-resistance to commonly used clinical antimicrobial drugs, with only cefoperazone/sulbactam, amikacin, and tigecycline demonstrating high sensitivity. Analysis of carbapenemase production revealed a significant prevalence of Ambler class A enzymes. The detection of CR-GNB in this hospital from 2019 to 2024 indicates a widespread distribution across clinical departments and infection sites, coupled with a high rate of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials. Local hospitals should prioritize the distribution patterns of CR-GNB to develop personalized prevention strategies, strengthen hospital public health and infection prevention and control measures, and promote rational use of antibiotics to effectively curb the spread of CR-GNB infections.","To elucidate the distribution characteristics and drug resistance of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria (CR-GNB) within a general hospital setting from 2019 to 2024.

10.7717/peerj.19528,Gut microbiota diversity and composition in children with autism spectrum disorder: associations with symptom severity.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder impairing social and communication skills. Gut microbiota has become key in understanding ASD pathophysiology. However, the relationship between the ASD symptoms and alternation of gut microbiota still remains unknow. We hypothesize that the composition of gut microbiota in children with ASD may be strongly associated with the severity of their symptoms. Here, fecal samples from children (divided in to three groups: neurotypical, severe ASD and mild ASD) at a hospital were collected. The symptoms of ASD were assessed by an experienced pediatric neurologist, and the severity of the symptoms in children with ASD was determined based on the assessment scores. Then the diversity and composition of gut microbiota were detected by high-throughput sequencing. In total, 2,021 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were obtained from 46 fecal samples, with highest in the neurotypical group. Alpha diversity in bacteria differed between severe and mild ASD. Microbiota health and dysbiosis indices varied with ASD severity. Beta diversity indicated that severe ASD differed from others, and mild ASD was closer to neurotypical in community structure. At the phylum level, Firmicutes was the dominant bacteria but abundances differed in different groups, and Ascomycota increased in severe ASD fungi. At the genus level, groups had distinct dominants, and mild ASD microbiota resembled that of neurotypical children. Function prediction revealed differences in bacteria and fungi, with severe ASD having higher amino acid metabolism, lower cofactor/vitamin metabolism, and more undefined saprotrophs. This study revealed gut microbiota differences between ASD children (varying symptoms) and neurotypical ones, showing milder ASD closer in microbiota aspects. It offers insights for exploring ASD pathogenesis and devising interventions.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder impairing social and communication skills.

10.1101/2025.05.03.652018,Virion stripping: A new role for bacterial proteases.,"We demonstrate that proteases produced by the oro-pharyngeal bacterial colonizer <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg)</i> reduce viral burden and modulate host interferon responses during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Several oral bacteria, including <i>Pg</i> , have been shown to translocate to the upper airways through sub-clinical micro-aspiration. Our findings reveal that <i>Pg</i> , upon translocating to this new niche, significantly attenuated lung damage by reducing viral loads during respiratory viral infections in the lungs of wild-type mice. This protective effect was attributed to the activity of gingipains, cysteine endopeptidases produced by <i>Pg</i> , which cleaved envelope glycoproteins on RSV as well as on related murine-specific Sendai virus (SeV), thereby impairing their infectious capacity. Notably, the reduction in viral loads was independent of interferon lambda (IFN-λ) signaling, which is actively suppressed by <i>Pg</i> in airway epithelial cells. However, the complete absence of IFN-λ signaling resulted in a stronger inflammatory response despite a low viral load. Thus, we show a previously undescribed role for the oro-respiratory bacterial colonizer <i>Pg</i> in creating bottlenecks to viral infection by the activity of its proteases. Reciprocal interactions between microbial colonizers and host epithelial cells are critical for providing initial defense against viral infections. However, our understanding of this phenomenon has been limited to microbiota-derived ligands that activate host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), inducing basal interferon expression and downstream antiviral genes. Here, we present a novel mechanism that relies on microbial proteases to directly reduce viral load. Specifically, we discovered that the infectious capacity of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) was significantly inhibited upon contact with the proteases (gingipains) produced by the oropharyngeal colonizer <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> . Gingipains caused proteolytic degradation of the RSV envelope and attachment proteins, rendering them inactive. This preemptive reduction in viral infectious capacity consequently diminished the severity of respiratory viral infections in an IFN-independent manner.","We demonstrate that proteases produced by the oro-pharyngeal bacterial colonizer <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg)</i> reduce viral burden and modulate host interferon responses during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.

10.1101/2025.05.26.25328184,A case-cohort longitudinal study for the analysis of microbial associations and viruses on the risk of celiac disease (MAVRiC).,"Celiac disease etiopathogenesis requires genetic predisposition and exposure to gluten before a child can develop the chronic autoimmune disorder. However, these factors alone are not sufficient. Even a child with persistent tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGA), i.e., celiac disease autoimmunity (CDA), does not necessarily develop celiac disease. Larger longitudinal studies are needed to determine the impact of time-varying infections and gut microorganisms on the subsequent and specific risk of celiac disease. The aim was to design a celiac disease case-cohort longitudinal study using The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study. Following the TEDDY cohort up age 3-years, CDA was confirmed in 704 of the 6132 genetically at-risk children. Celiac disease onset was defined as the age CDA developed when followed by a biopsy-proven diagnosis. A competing risk analysis was performed on celiac disease onset cases (CD-onset) as well as CDA children with no diagnosis (CDA-only) and results show genetic factors (additional HLA-DR3-DQ2 haplotype, higher non-HLA polygenic risk score, sex-girl) and a more rapid increase in gluten-consumption correlate with significant increased risk of both outcomes. However, reports of virus-related respiratory infections in August to October during follow-up correlated with an increased risk of a CD-onset but not with CDA-only. To create a case-cohort study, a sub-cohort of 561 children (9% sampling fraction) was first randomly selected to represent the TEDDY cohort over time while at risk of CDA. It included 483 children followed until age 3-years and 78 children followed before developing CDA (CDA-only n=41/78, CD-onset n=37/78). All incident CD-onset children (N=306) were included to form the case group. This case-cohort will be utilized to analyze virus antibodies and bacteriome from longitudinal plasma and stool samples (the Microbial Associations and Viruses on the Risk of Celiac disease study, MAVRiC).","Celiac disease etiopathogenesis requires genetic predisposition and exposure to gluten before a child can develop the chronic autoimmune disorder. However, these factors alone are not sufficient. Even a child with persistent tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGA), i.e., celiac disease autoimmunity (CDA), does not necessarily develop celiac disease. Larger longitudinal studies are needed to determine the impact of time-varying infections and gut microorganisms on the subsequent and specific risk of celiac disease. The aim was to design a celiac disease case-cohort longitudinal study using The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study. Following the TEDDY cohort up age 3-years, CDA was confirmed in 704 of the 6132 genetically at-risk children.

Associations between preexisting YFV and WNV immunity with symptoms and adverse infant outcomes among pregnant women exposed to flaviviruses are unknown. We retrospectively studied a prospective cohort of pregnant women enrolled between 2019 and 2022 in Jos, Nigeria. Rapid tests identified ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV IgM/IgG reactivity for enrollment; 216 women underwent Western blot for YFV and WNV IgG. Logistic regression evaluated associations between arboviral seropositivity and maternal symptoms or adverse infant outcomes. Sequential serology of mother-infant pairs estimated the persistence of passively transferred maternal YFV antibodies. YFV IgG was detected in 50.5% (109/216) and WNV IgG in 5.1% (11/216) of maternal samples. YFV and WNV seropositivity was significantly associated with maternal symptoms (OR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.35-3.02, P = 0.001), as was YFV seropositivity alone (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.21-2.61, P < 0.004). CHIKV IgM reactivity was significantly associated with abnormal infant outcomes (OR = 2.38, 95% CI: 1.43-4.02, p = 0.001), but not ZIKV and DENV IgM reactivity. Passive maternal YFV IgG waned in infants at a median of 3.1 months (IQR: 1.65-5.35 months) after birth. YFV and WNV seropositivity was associated with maternal symptoms but not with adverse infant outcomes. Rapid waning of maternal YFV IgG highlights infant vulnerability and supports enhanced surveillance and maternal immunization strategies.","Yellow fever virus (YFV) and West Nile virus (WNV) co-circulate with other arboviruses, including Zika (ZIKV), dengue (DENV), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), in sub-Saharan Africa.

The quality of soybean paste has been proven to be related to microbial metabolic activities. However, the effect of different raw materials on the microbial diversity of soybean paste under the same incubation conditions remains unclear. For this, we investigated variation of microbial communities in soybean paste manufactured with two different raw materials (Tartary buckwheat flour and wheat flour) analyzed by amplicon sequencing. The results showed that the dominant bacteria in the two soybean pastes were γ-proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Bacilli, the dominant fungal were Mucoromycetes, Tremellomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Saccharomycetes. Bacterial diversity and abundance showed no significant difference in the two soybean pastes; fungal abundance showed no significant difference, whereas fungal diversity differed significantly (P < 0.05). Also, Bacterial abundance correlated positively with amino acid nitrogen (AAN) and total acidity (TA) in flour bean paste, while fungal diversity correlated negatively with AAN and TA in buckwheat bean paste. Collectively, raw materials have a significant effect on the microbial community of soybean paste. Besides, these results could provide valuable reference data for enhancing the quality and safety of soybean paste in manufacture.","Soybean paste as one of the most extensively used traditional fermented condiments in our daily lives.

Dietary fiber derived from whole grains is one of the key factors contributing to these benefits. These fibers act as prebiotics, promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and shaping microbial composition in the gut. This study examined the effects of wheat and dark rye, two fiber-rich whole grains, on the gut microbiota using an in vitro fecal incubation system. Following whole grain treatment, the gut microbiota showed an increase in the relative abundances of <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Blautia</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>. These bacteria are known short-chain fatty acid producers, suggesting a potential role in supporting host health. Additionally, functional pathway analysis predicted the upregulation of metabolic pathways related to specific carbohydrate metabolism.

Traditional serum-based testing, while effective, poses logistical challenges for large-scale surveillance, particularly in remote regions, for small-bodied species or in scenarios such as hunter-harvested samples where serum collection can be impractical. This study evaluates the use of whole blood collected on high-quality cellulose filter strips as an alternative to serum for detecting antibodies against IAV nucleoprotein (NP) and hemagglutinin (HA) H5 and H7 targets. We tested paired serum and whole blood on filter strips collected from wild birds using the commercially available IDEXX AI MultiS Screen Ab test and in-house competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) developed at the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD) of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Strong correlations (<i>ρ</i> = 0.77) were observed between serum and whole blood on filter strips for NP detection with the IDEXX ELISA, while moderate correlations were noted for NCFAD's NP (<i>ρ</i> = 0.58) and H5 (<i>ρ</i> = 0.65) assays. Correlation between serum and whole blood on filter strips for NCFAD's H7 assay was poor, although interpretation is limited due to the small sample size of H7 positives. Threshold optimization using the Youden index improved diagnostic performance, with optimized cutoffs identified for NP (sample-to-negative < 0.7708 for IDEXX and percentage inhibition [PI] > 39.56 for NCFAD) and H5 (PI > 20.37). Storage conditions impacted performance, with frozen whole blood on filter strips achieving higher sensitivity compared to those stored at room temperature. These findings support the use of filter strips to collect whole blood as an informative alternative for IAV serological surveillance in wild birds when serum is unavailable, provided optimal storage conditions and threshold adjustments are implemented, although serum remains the superior sample type.","Serological surveillance enhances our understanding of influenza A virus (IAV) exposure and dynamics in wild bird populations.

Rectal/colonic biopsies were obtained at inclusion, and DNA and RNA were extracted from the same biopsy and examined by sequencing the 16S rRNA V4 region. Beta diversity measurements separated IBD from both HC and SC. IBD and SC exhibited reduced intra-individual diversity compared with HC. When comparing taxonomy at DNA and RNA level, six bacteria were found to differ in abundance and/or transcriptional activity between IBD and symptomatic control, while there were 14 and three between symptomatic control and CD and UC, respectively. A limited number of bacterial taxa were responsible for the largest difference between presence and activity, separating patients and controls. Multiple bacterial taxa were associated with treatment escalation in both UC and CD. Machine-learning models separated IBD from symptomatic controls and treatment escalators from non-escalators (AUC >0.8). However, the differential effects were mainly driven by clinical biomarkers, such as f-calprotectin, s-albumin, and b-hemoglobin. Differences between presence and transcriptional activity were found among multiple taxa when assessing 16S rRNA at DNA and RNA level.

In addition, the potential probiotic <i>Enterococcus casseliflavus</i> (relative abundance: 0.51% vs 0.03%) was more abundant in the resistant family, whereas <i>Lactococcus garvieae</i> (RA: 20.18% vs 70%) was enriched in the susceptible one. These findings highlight the combined contribution of host transcriptomic responses and gut microbial communities to DIV1 resistance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate transcriptomic and microbiomic analyses for investigating DIV1 resistance in <i>M. rosenbergii</i>. These findings provide novel insights into the host-pathogen interaction and offer valuable targets for selective breeding of DIV1-resistant <i>M. rosenbergii</i> in aquaculture.",PubMed
10.3389/fimmu.2025.1594891,Review of the mechanism of infection induced cerebral small vessel disease.,"Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) refers to a group of pathological syndromes that affect the brain's microcirculation. These conditions involve damage to small arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and small veins. Cerebrovascular risk factors, immunosenescence, and inflammatory responses contribute to the pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease. The global impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has drawn significant attention to chronic inflammation caused by infections. Research into the mechanisms by which infections induce CSVD has made continual advancements. It is imperative to reassess the importance of managing infections and the chronic inflammatory phase that follows, highlighting their critical role in the pathogenesis. Our focus encompasses SARS-CoV-2, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Zika Virus(ZIKV), Treponema pallidum, as well as the microbial communities within the gut and oral cavity. These pathogen infections and chronic inflammation can contribute to CSVD through mechanisms such as neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption, microthrombosis, and endothelial cell damage, thereby promoting the occurrence and progression of the disease. This highlights the need for detailed mechanistic research on CSVD associated with these pathogens. Furthermore, we hope that in the future, we will be able to devise targeted prevention and treatment strategies for CSVD based on the unique characteristics of the pathogenic mechanisms associated with various infections.","Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) refers to a group of pathological syndromes that affect the brain's microcirculation.

This study explores the evolutionary mechanisms influencing PCV2 variability, emphasizing the role of viral features and host environment. An extensive collection of globally available ORF2 sequences of the main PCV2 genotypes (i.e., PCV2a, PCV2b, and PCV2d) sampled from wild boars and domestic pigs was analyzed, using a combination of phylodynamic approaches and biostatistical methods to infer the presence and patterns of selective pressures in different virus population subsets. Significant differences were observed between strains collected from domestic and wild populations, with the former appearing to be under stronger selective pressures at specific capsid positions. These pressures are likely driven by immune-mediated selection acting on critical residues for immune system recognition and evasion. A comprehensive evaluation of substitution patterns also revealed a trend toward maintaining or enhancing amino acid polarity, with neutral residues often replaced by polar or charged ones. This shift may influence the virus interaction with host proteins, particularly glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate-like molecules. The observed variability among hosts and genotypes highlights both the importance of host environment as a key driver of viral evolution and the plasticity of PCV2 adaptability, with multiple alternative evolutionary pathways seemingly being selected. The findings underscore the complex evolutionary trajectories followed by PCV2 on a global scale and suggest that the intensification of pig farming and associated management practices may have significantly shaped PCV2 evolution, contributing to the current epidemiological landscape.","Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is a significant pathogen in swine, exhibiting notable genetic and phenotypic diversity.

Nevertheless, the cytotoxicity of the BaEV envelope protein necessitates the production of this type of viral vector by transient transfection, which significantly constrains its potential for large-scale industrial application. In this study, we constructed a stably packed BaEV-PackRV cell line for BaEVenveloped retroviral vectors. This packaging cell line was constructed to stably express gag, pol, and BaEV envelope proteins, which are essential for retroviral packaging. To this end, we avoided the occurrence of syncytia during virus preparation by knocking out the ASCT-1/2 receptor in the packaging cell line. Compared with the existing methods, the transduction efficiency of the retroviral vector produced by BaEV-PackRV was significantly greater in primary immune cells at a lower multiplicity of infection (MOI), and the transduced CAR-T or CAR-NK cells maintained good expansion capacity and enhanced cytotoxicity. On this basis, our system enables large-scale industrial production of BaEV-coated retroviral vectors while significantly reducing costs.This will greatly improve the efficacy of NK cell gene transfer and the effectiveness of related treatments.","Viral vectors with Baboon endogenous virus (BaEV) envelope proteins have been demonstrated to markedly increase gene transfer efficiency to NK cells.

However, such epidemiological knowledge is limited for feral cattle and is usually derived from farmed populations. We assessed endoparasite infection in a feral cattle population in Hong Kong. This population does not receive any routine care or anthelminthic treatment, although some cattle are provisioned with water and hay by local citizens. We assessed three indices of endoparasite infection (parasite richness, prevalence and fecal egg/oocyst count) and their associated risk factors (season, provisioning, marshland access, group size, sex and body condition) in adult cattle. We conducted sedimentation, McMaster and coproculture techniques on 262 samples collected from 177 cattle. We identified eleven taxa of nematodes, two taxa of trematodes, one taxon of protozoan and one taxon of cestode. Median parasite richness was two parasite taxa per individual. Trematode infections were the most prevalent (91.22 %), followed by protozoan (67.17 %), nematode (23.22 %) and cestode (12.97 %) infections. Counts averaged 144.85 oocysts per gram for <i>Eimeria</i> oocysts<i>,</i> 20.61 eggs per gram (EPG) for strongyle-type eggs, 11.83 EPG for <i>Moniezia</i> and 1.91 EPG for <i>Trichuris</i>. Provisioned herds were more likely to be infected with <i>Eimeria</i>, but had lower prevalence of <i>Trichostrongylus</i>. <i>Eimeria</i> prevalence and strongyle-type egg counts were higher in the wet season, while <i>Fasciola</i> eggs, <i>Cooperia</i> and <i>Trichostrongylus</i> larvae were more prevalent in the dry season. Larger herds had higher <i>Eimeria</i> oocyst prevalence but lower <i>Fasciola</i> egg prevalence. Marshland access decreased <i>Fasciola</i> egg prevalence while it increased prevalence of <i>Cooperia</i> larvae. Males were more infected with strongyle-type eggs than female cattle. We show that the seasonal dynamics of infection and consequences of provisioning differ between endoparasite taxa. Our findings highlight complex interactions between endoparasites and their hosts, providing new insights into wild ruminants' health and the impacts of anthropogenic provisioning.","Understanding parasite epidemiology is essential for managing endoparasite infections in free-ranging animals.

Patient-initiated therapy (PIT) enables patients with RHS to initiate high-dose antiviral medication at their own discretion as soon as prodromal symptoms appear. While famciclovir-based PIT offers the convenience of a single-day treatment and has shown efficacy comparable to low-dose, long-term regimens such as 5-day treatment, no reports have evaluated its impact on the annual recurrence rate. To investigate this further, we conducted a single-center, chart-based retrospective study to assess the effect of PIT on annual recurrence rate. Patients who visited a medical institution for RHS and who had their recurrence frequency recorded over the preceding year were included. Annual recurrence number, adherence, treatment efficacy, and other relevant factors were assessed through interviews and questionnaires. The effectiveness and safety of PIT were compared with conventional 5-day oral anti-herpesvirus treatment. Sixty patients who were prescribed famciclovir for PIT were enrolled, of whom 43 with recurrent episodes were included in the efficacy analysis population. The mean number of recurrences during the first year of PIT was 2.8 (SD: 2.1), representing a significant reduction compared to 5.3 (SD: 2.9) during 5-day treatment (p < 0.001). Patient questionnaires indicated high adherence, treatment efficacy, and preference for PIT. Regarding safety, no increase in adverse events was observed compared to 5-day treatment. Famciclovir-based PIT significantly reduced the recurrence rate of RHS, demonstrated high adherence and treatment efficacy, was preferred by patients, and was well tolerated. These results support PIT as a promising therapeutic approach for management of recurrent herpes simplex.","Although recurrent herpes simplex (RHS) is usually self-limiting, it can significantly impair quality of life due to frequent recurrences and associated symptoms.

Although designed to target harmful bacteria, they can also affect non-target organisms in aquatic ecosystems. Standard toxicological tests often fail to detect the subtle or long term antibiotic-induced effects, but newer methods are providing valuable insights into the molecular pathways and physiological responses they affect. <i>Chironomus riparius</i>, a dipteran with aquatic larvae, is widely used in toxicological testing due to its sensitivity to various toxicants. However, little is known about the molecular effects of antibiotics on this species. This study investigated the gene expression profile of <i>C. riparius</i> in response to antibiotics from three classes - aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and penicillin. Fourth instar larvae were exposed to concentrations of 0.001, 0.1 and 10 mg/L for 24 and 72 h. The expression of genes involved in hormonal regulation, detoxification, stress response and DNA repair was analysed. The results showed that all antibiotics altered mRNA levels, with three of the four (amoxicillin, neomycin and levofloxacin) downregulating genes at 24 h and upregulating them at 72 h. Genes affected by gentamicin showed the opposite trend. These transcriptional changes in response to different antibiotics highlight the complexity of the regulatory mechanisms involved in development, detoxification, stress response and DNA repair in aquatic insects. Further research is needed to better understand the molecular effects of antibiotics on this species.","Antibiotics, like other pharmaceuticals, are continuously released into the environment as a result of human activities.

Children with chronic or end-stage kidney disease may not respond effectively to live varicella vaccination, making it controversial post-transplant. Antiviral treatments for shingles can be nephrotoxic, and reducing immunosuppression to enhance immune responses may risk transplant rejection. Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) was initially indicated for immunosuppressed adults over 50. We present a case of an adolescent who, after receiving the live varicella vaccine with an observed IgG seroconversion, developed recurrent shingles post-kidney transplant and varicella seronegative status. Antiviral treatments and reduced immunosuppression contributed to graft loss. Post-second transplant, shingles recurred, leading to off-label RZV administration while fully immunosuppressed. Following RZV, there were no rejection or shingles episodes, and strong IgG seroconversion was achieved. Following RZV treatment, guidelines regarding RZV were updated to include individuals over 19, which may potentially benefit pediatric transplant recipients.","Shingles, a reactivation of the varicella virus, is more common in immunosuppressed patients.

Glycosylated mucins, the core components of this barrier, are essential for preserving its integrity by preventing bacterial degradation. Additionally, mucins significantly contribute to establishing a balanced symbiotic relationship between the host and microbes. These mucins have the potential to mitigate intestinal epithelial damage by capturing and transporting cell debris and pathogenic bacteria. Meanwhile, certain bacteria help maintain the equilibrium and stability of the gut microbiome by degrading glycosylated mucins to utilize the carbohydrate chains, thus affecting the cytokine expression to regulate the synthesis and secretion of specific glycans. Investigating the complex connections between the mucus barrier and mucin glycosylation holds great promise for advancing our understanding of gastrointestinal disease mechanisms, paving the way for innovative prevention and treatment strategies.","The intestinal mucus barrier is a crucial component of the host's innate defense system, playing a vital role in regulating intestinal microecology and maintaining intestinal homeostasis.

10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf176,Development of a nonreplicative phage-based DNA delivery system and its application to antimicrobial therapies.,"Phage therapy has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional antimicrobial therapy for antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections, but concerns about uncontrolled phage proliferation have limited its use. To address this issue, we established a nonproliferative phage-based DNA delivery system, called bacteria-targeting capsid particle (B-CAP), for the development of antimicrobial agents which effectively prevented phage spread while maintaining bactericidal activity. B-CAP is principally a T7 phage capsids packaged with a partial T7 phage genome, giving it the allowance to accommodate large foreign DNA up to 18 kb in length. We confirmed the efficacy of B-CAP in targeting and injecting its genome into bacteria, analogous to the wild-type phage. To demonstrate proof-of-concept and potential for developing an antimicrobial agent, we loaded colicin E1 operon onto the B-CAP system, resulting in the construction of B-CAP_ColE1, an antimicrobial agent capable of boosting colicin E1-based bacterial killing against Escherichia <i>coli</i>. Although no therapeutic effect was observed for B-CAP, B-CAP_ColE1 exhibited strong bactericidal activity against carbapenem-resistant <i>E. coli</i> both in vitro and in vivo, and significantly improved the survival of mice in an infection mouse model experiment. Finally, B-CAP_ColE1 is biologically contained or inert, reducing potential biological hazards during therapeutic use.

10.1002/ece3.71519,The Significance of Genetic Relatedness and Nest Sharing on the Worker-Worker Similarity of Gut Bacterial Microbiome and Cuticular Hydrocarbon Profile in a Sweat Bee.,"The cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profile and the gut microbiome (GM) are crucial traits which have a significant impact on the life of bees. In honey bees, the CHC profile and the GM interact finely through trophallaxis, such that the characteristics of the GM are partially defined by the chemical recognition among sisters. However, most of the known primitively eusocial bees show simpler social traits, including moderate genetic relatedness among colony members, often due to workers' nest drifting or dispersal, and lack of trophallaxis. Hence, primitively eusocial bees offer a great opportunity to evaluate the respective role of worker-worker genetic relatedness and of the environment in which the adult lives (residency nest) on the interaction between CHC profile and GM. Here, we investigated such relationships in the primitively eusocial digger bee <i>Halictus scabiosae</i> (Halictidae). We found a high rate of nest-drifting by workers, which leads to a consequent highly variable intra-colonial genetic relatedness. Genetically closely related workers, even occupying distant nests, did possess both a more similar microbiome profile and a more similar CHC profile. Additionally, sharing the same nest seemed to account for the similarity of both CHC profile and GM among workers. Interestingly, differences in microbiome profile and in CHC profile were highly and positively correlated across workers, even after controlling for genetic relatedness. The results of our study point towards an impact of genetic relatedness on the GM and the CHC profile, but also suggest that microbiome and CHC profile are partially acquired through adult nest environment, and that microbiome possibly has a role in shaping the cuticular chemistry.","The cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profile and the gut microbiome (GM) are crucial traits which have a significant impact on the life of bees.

10.1016/j.isci.2025.112573,Soluble CD4 inhibits Ebola virus infection by targeting endosomal receptor-binding site.,"Human CD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) is well known as the primary receptor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry into the cells. The virus binds to CD4 molecules to induce a conformational change in the viral glycoprotein (GP) gp120, which exposes the co-receptor binding site for coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4. The co-receptor binding then leads to membrane fusion for viral entry. Since the CD4 molecule has a high affinity for gp120, soluble CD4 (sCD4) and CD4-mimetic small molecules (CD4mcs) have been extensively studied as potential inhibitors for HIV infection. Surprisingly, we have found that human sCD4 and some CD4mcs are able to inhibit Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. Evidence is provided that the compounds block viral entry by targeting the GP binding site for the endosomal receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). This finding reveals virus-receptor binding similarities between two remote viruses (HIV and EBOV) and suggests new possibilities for EBOV entry inhibitors.","Human CD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) is well known as the primary receptor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry into the cells.

The co-receptor binding then leads to membrane fusion for viral entry. Since the CD4 molecule has a high affinity for gp120, soluble CD4 (sCD4) and CD4-mimetic small molecules (CD4mcs) have been extensively studied as potential inhibitors for HIV infection. Surprisingly, we have found that human sCD4 and some CD4mcs are able to inhibit Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. Evidence is provided that the compounds block viral entry by targeting the GP binding site for the endosomal receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). This finding reveals virus-receptor binding similarities between two remote viruses (HIV and EBOV) and suggests new possibilities for EBOV entry inhibitors.",PubMed
10.1016/j.gastha.2025.100661,Modeling 5-Year Hepatocellular Carcinoma Risk in Alaska Native Peoples With Hepatitis B Virus Infection.,"Modeling hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in Alaska Native (AN) peoples with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is important for risk stratification and surveillance. Existing HCC risk prediction models use baseline characteristics ascertained at the time of HBV diagnosis, rather than predicting HCC risk within 5 years of a relevant time point (such as a clinic visit), and do not include the HBV genotype (GT). We aimed to develop an HCC risk prediction model that addresses these limitations. We used longitudinal data from a cohort of 1163 AN peoples with HBV. We considered age, sex, GT, serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP), along with serum alanine transaminase, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, hepatitis B-e-antigen, platelet count, and fibrosis 4 score. To build a 5-year risk model, we structured the longitudinal data into multiple 5-year segments, using AFP as the landmark biomarker. We used the generalized estimation equation approach as well as the Random Forest approach to build risk prediction models. Among the 11 predictors included in our final models, AFP was the most important followed by platelet count and GT. Based on cross-validation, the generalized estimation equation model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81, with 46.5% sensitivity at 90% specificity for 5-year HCC risk prediction. The Random Forest model was superior with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 and 70% sensitivity at 90% specificity, outperforming the PAGE-B, mPAGE-B, REACH-B and REAL-B models. We developed an HCC risk prediction model using rich information from different time points in a patient's disease trajectory. Our model can accurately estimate HCC risk at different time points during follow-up for risk stratification and risk-based surveillance.","Modeling hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in Alaska Native (AN) peoples with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is important for risk stratification and surveillance.

During its lifecycle, <i>T. cruzi</i> alternates between replicative and non-replicative infective lifeforms. Metacyclogenesis is the most studied transition of the <i>T. cruzi</i> life cycle, where replicative epimastigotes differentiate into infective metacyclic trypomastigotes inside the gut of the triatomine vector. This early-branching organism expresses a divergent pre-replication complex (pre-RC) where the only conserved component is the MCM2-7 protein family. Given the role of pre-RC components in cell cycle regulation, we investigated whether MCM expression and location could be involved in proliferation control in epimastigotes and during metacyclogenesis. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we tagged MCM subunits and tracked their expression and subcellular localization. Our findings reveal that MCM subunits are consistently expressed and localized to the nucleus throughout the epimastigote cell cycle, including in G1/G0-arrested cells. However, MCM subunits are degraded during metacyclogenesis as cells enter the G0 state, marking the transition to replication arrest. Therefore, epimastigotes arrested in G1/G0 can either maintain MCM complex expression and resume the cell cycle when conditions become favorable, or they can undergo metacyclogenesis, exiting the cell cycle and entering a G0 state, where MCM subunits are degraded as part of the replication repression mechanism.","<i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> is a protozoan parasite that is the etiological agent of Chagas disease, which is endemic to Latin America with reported cases in non-endemic regions such as Europe, Asia, and Oceania due to migration.

A total of 115 patients with probable pulmonary infection between September 2022 and April 2023 were enrolled at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Changsha, China, of which 61 were clinically diagnosed with invasive pulmonary fungal infection (IPFI) and 54 were non-IPFI cases. All patients received bronchoalveolar lavage, with mNGS, tNGS, and cultures being conducted paralleled. Diagnostic effectiveness and consistency in detecting microorganisms were compared. Both mNGS and tNGS showed high sensitivity rates of 95.08% each, with specificity of 90.74% and 85.19%, respectively. They also demonstrated positive predictive values (PPVs) of 92.1% and 87.9% and negative predictive values (NPVs) of 94.2% and 93.9%, respectively, in diagnosing IPFI. The sensitivity and NPV of mNGS and tNGS were superior to that of any individual or combined conventional microbiological tests (CMTs) (P < 0.05). The consistency of culture with mNGS and tNGS was 48.70% and 50.43%, respectively. For fungal detection, <i>Pneumocystis jirovecii</i> (26/61, 42.6%; and 28/61, 45.9%), <i>Candida albicans</i> (19/61, 31.1%; and 21/61, 34.4%), and <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> (16/61, 26.2%; and 15/61, 24.6%) are most prevalent for mNGS and tNGS in enrolled cases, and the detection rate was greatly higher than that of culture. Furthermore, mNGS and tNGS were capable of diagnosing mixed infections in 65 and 55 out of the 115 cases, whereas only nine cases of bacterial-fungal infection were detected by culture. The diagnostic efficacy of mNGS and tNGS was comparable to that of identified IPFI.

To achieve the objective set by the World Health Organization of reducing malaria cases by 2030, antimalarial drugs with novel modes of action are required. Previously, a novel mechanism of action of chloroquine (CQ) was reported involving features of programmed cell death in the parasite, mainly characterized by calcium efflux from digestive vacuole permeabilization. Increased intracellular calcium induces suicidal death of erythrocytes, a process known as eryptosis. This study aimed to identify the hallmarks of eryptosis due to calcium redistribution and examine the downstream cellular effects during CQ treatment in infected red blood cells (iRBCs). Synchronized <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> 3D7 cultures at mid-late trophozoites were treated with CQ and other antimalarial compounds for 10 hours. Eryptotic markers, including phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing, were assessed by flow cytometry, scanning electron microscopy and western blot, respectively. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from 3D7 malaria culture supernatants using differential ultracentrifugation, followed by their physical and proteomic characterization. THP-1-derived macrophages were stimulated with EVs to determine parasite-host interactions, as indicated by cytokine levels and transcriptomic analysis. Increased PS exposure, cell shrinkage, and membrane blebbing were observed, delineating an eryptotic phenotype in the host RBCs. Notably, the outward budding and blebbing of the iRBC plasma membrane led to the formation of EVs, which are complex structures with unique functional properties. Proteomic characterization of EVs from CQ-treated iRBCs revealed a high enrichment of proteasome and ribosome protein clusters. This unique EV cargo did not influence the parasite growth rate but might activate IFN signaling pathways mediated by IL-6 in THP-1-derived macrophages. These findings provide new insights into a novel drug-induced cell death mechanism that targets the parasite and specific components of the infected host RBC.","Malaria is a vector-borne parasitic disease that affects millions worldwide.

Ozone emerges as a promising one, being economical, safe, and chemical-free. It effectively inactivates bacteria, molds, yeasts, parasites, and viruses with short contact times and at low concentrations. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of ozonated water as an eco-friendly, chemical-free, and safe alternative to conventional sanitizers in the processed fishery products industry. More specifically, it compares ozonated-water efficacy with the company's standard method of sanitizing boxes used for soaking cod (spraying the boxes with hydrogen peroxide before placing them in the dishwasher) and its efficacy on boxes stored for 21 days after the standard sanitation. A total of 175 boxes were tested for microbial contamination. The standard sanitization method significantly reduced the microbial load on the boxes after their use compared to the ozone one, resulting in a reduction of 98.29% compared to 48.29% for total mesophilic count (TMC) and 97.96% compared to 37.32% for total psychrophilic count (TPC), respectively. On day 21, the ozonated water achieved a TMC reduction of 80.46% and 98.87% for the TPC on stored boxes. The percentage reduction given by ozonated water on stored boxes was higher than on dirty ones; the presence of organic matter reduces the sanitizing efficacy of ozone. Based on the obtained evidence, ozonated water would appear to be a good sanitation method for surfaces in the processed fishery products industry after adequate cleaning, contributing to the industry's push toward sustainable practices.","In response to the modern consumer demands for safe and high-quality food, industries are adopting innovative decontamination methods.

Using a rhesus macaque model of simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection, we evaluated the functional responses of peripheral granulocytes using a newly developed whole blood intracellular cytokine staining assay. We observed elevated secretion of interleukin 8 and reduced secretion of tumor necrosis factor α in peripheral eosinophils from SHIV-infected animals stimulated with lipopolysaccharide compared to experimentally naive animals. Our data suggest potential functional skewing of peripheral eosinophils towards an enhanced effector response against secondary stimuli, warranting further investigation into the mechanistic understanding of granulocyte functions to inform developing HIV therapeutics.","As innate immune cells, granulocytic eosinophils form part of the first line of defense against pathogens.

This review explores recent strategies, innovations, and clinical applications of flagellin-based immunotherapies, particularly in the context of infectious diseases and cancers. Flagellin from Salmonella typhimurium has been extensively studied as a vaccine adjuvant for diseases like HIV, influenza, dengue, West Nile virus, poultry cholera, and bursal diseases and shows promise in treating lung metastasis, melanoma, colon, and prostate cancers. It has also proven effective against multidrug-resistant bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. typhimurium. Notably, S. typhimurium flagellin-based vaccines for influenza have progressed to clinical trials. Additionally, flagellins from S. typhi, S. enteritidis, P. aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli are being evaluated as vaccine candidates for plague, malaria, and infections caused by P. aeruginosa and E. coli.

The National Health Insurance Research Database, Registry for Catastrophic Illness Patients, Tuberculosis Database, and Household Registration Records of Taiwan were analyzed. Propensity score matching was used to reduce basic characteristic differences between mental illness patients and the general public. The conditional Cox proportional hazards model and cumulative risk curve were used to compare their risk of developing TB. It was shown that TB incidence was 87 and 71 per 100 000 person-years in mental illness patients and the general public, respectively. The risk of developing TB in mental illness patients was 1.48 times (95% CI: 1.38-1.59) that of the general public.

Serine-derived downstream metabolism contributes to urea-enriched metabolic pathways in rumen fluid. This study examined the effects of 7.50 g kg<sup>-1</sup> dry matter serine supplementation on fermentation parameters and microbial communities in urea-based substrates. Fifteen amino acids were detected in the fermentation fluid. Urea-based substrates exhibited distinct amino acid profiles compared to the control basal substrate, with lower levels of most amino acids except cysteine (Cys), leucine (Leu), and phenylalanine (Phe). Serine supplementation increased propionate production, microbial protein synthesis, and dry matter digestibility, while decreasing isovalerate, isoleucine (Ile), and Leu levels. Additionally, serine supplementation altered microbial populations, increasing Ruminobacter and Bacteroidales_BS11_gut_group by 24.47% and 26.42%, respectively, while decreasing Prevotella and WCHB1-41 by 9.30% and 24.15%, respectively. Glycine and folate, which are downstream metabolites of serine, exhibited partial similarity to serine regarding their influence on fermentation profiles. Notably, serine reduced the fermentation of Leu and Ile into isovalerate, irrespective of their supplementation, exhibiting a dosage-dependent effect. In short, serine supplementation in urea-based substrates enhances fermentation, promoting the utilization of urea nitrogen and amino acids.

Glycine and folate, which are downstream metabolites of serine, exhibited partial similarity to serine regarding their influence on fermentation profiles. Notably, serine reduced the fermentation of Leu and Ile into isovalerate, irrespective of their supplementation, exhibiting a dosage-dependent effect. In short, serine supplementation in urea-based substrates enhances fermentation, promoting the utilization of urea nitrogen and amino acids. Serine mediated crosstalk between the 'serine-glycine-folate' metabolic pathway and reshaped microbial communities to improve the utilization of urea nitrogen and amino acids. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",PubMed
10.1111/1751-7915.70171,Revitalising Brewers' Spent Grains and Enriching With Biogenic Compounds Through the Fermentation of Fructophilic Lactic Acid Bacteria and Yeasts.,"The large output of spent grains from the brewing industry presents environmental concerns but also offers promising nutritional and functional potential for valorization by researchers and industrial stakeholders. In this perspective, we investigated how non-conventional starters like Fructobacillus fructosus PL22 and Wickerhamomyces anomalus GY1 can drive the fermentation of brewer's spent grain (BSG), a solid by-product of the brewing industry, to enrich its portfolio of bioactive compounds. While sugar reduction was comparable between started- and unstarted-BSG, the effect of the fermentation became evident through the release of key microbial metabolites (lactic and acetic acids and ethanol). Both starters generated the highest number of unique peptides, with only one previously identified as antioxidant peptide found in BSG fermented with F. fructosus. During fermentation, most amino acids and phenolic compounds decreased, while BSG fermented with W. anomalus distinctly enhanced the release of Ala, Cys and GABA, and health-promoting phenolic compounds, such as gallic acid, gallocatechin, quercetin, naringenin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin. These metabolic changes were associated with the enhanced antifungal and antioxidant properties, which in turn positively reflected on skin protection as shown by the increased proliferation of human keratinocytes, over-expression of the filaggrin (FLG) gene, and wound healing. The power of fermentation to revitalise BSG, giving it a second life chance through the improvement of its nutritional value and further multifunctionality, was demonstrated.","The large output of spent grains from the brewing industry presents environmental concerns but also offers promising nutritional and functional potential for valorization by researchers and industrial stakeholders.

However, studies in Japan are limited, and no study has evaluated the relationship between the incidence of CAPA and specialist involvement in its diagnosis. We aimed to obtain new epidemiological data on CAPA in Japan and evaluate the relationship between the incidence of CAPA and specialist involvement in its diagnosis. A survey was conducted among chief physicians at 760 training hospitals with at least 100 beds and accredited by the Japanese Respiratory Society or the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases. Critical patients with COVID-19 diagnosed with CAPA between 1 January 2020 and 31 August 2023 were analysed. A literature review was conducted to evaluate the correlations between the incidence of CAPA and galactomannan (GM) testing and positivity rates. Responses were obtained from 221 of the 760 hospitals (29.1%). The incidence of CAPA was 0.67% (69/10,276). Hospitals with patients with CAPA had significantly more pulmonologists and infectious disease specialists than those without patients with CAPA. A strong positive correlation was observed between the incidence of CAPA and the number of pulmonologists per critical patient with COVID-19 (r = 0.824, p < 0.001). The literature review showed that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid GM testing rate was a strong positive correlation with the incidence of CAPA (r = 0.527, p = 0.014). For the diagnosis of CAPA, its recognition by specialists primarily involved in managing critical patients with COVID-19 seems essential.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) has been reported worldwide.

Initially described as ""NK-cell enteropathy"" and ""lymphomatoid gastropathy"" over a decade ago, recent molecular and cytogenetic studies have confirmed its neoplastic nature. Although primarily affecting the gastrointestinal tract, iNKLPD has also been reported in rare extra-intestinal sites, including the gallbladder, lymph nodes, nasopharynx, and vagina.<i>Patient Presentation</i>We report the first documented nasal cavity lesion, identifying this anatomic site as a novel manifestation of the disease. A 67-year-old woman patient presented with recurrent postnasal drip symptoms persisting for one year following an upper respiratory tract infection. Imaging studies revealed a nasal mass on head computed tomography (CT), prompting endoscopic resection. Intraoperatively, a mulberry-like neoplasm was identified in the left nasal septum. Histopathological examination using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining revealed diffuse infiltration by medium to large round cells. Immunohistochemical profiling demonstrated positive expression of CD56, CD3, BCL2, TIA1, and granzyme B, with a Ki-67 proliferation index of 50%. CD5, CD20, CD21, CD23, CD10, BCL6, CD30, PAX5, and PD-1 were negative. Notably, in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded RNA was negative, and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement was not detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, confirming the diagnosis of iNKLPD. After 11 months of follow-up, the patient showed no local recurrence or signs of lymph node enlargement in other anatomical regions. Furthermore, proteomics analysis of the tumor was conducted in conjunction with gene ontology (GO) functional and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses.<i>Conclusion</i>Although iNKLPD is a rare tumor, lesions involving the nasal cavity are exceptionally uncommon and have not been reported in the literature. This unique lesion represents the first documented occurrence of iNKLPD in the nasal cavity, contributing to the comprehensive understanding of its pathological diagnosis and clinical management. Proteomics analysis of the tumor has provided valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this rare disease.","<i>Background</i>Indolent NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorder of the gastrointestinal tract (iNKLPD) is a newly recognized entity in the 5th edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Haematolymphoid Tumours: Lymphoid Neoplasms.

However, the epidemiology and clinical features of TMVII infection remain poorly understood. To systematically review published TMVII cases and characterise its demographic distribution, transmission patterns, clinical manifestations and treatment outcomes. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, including all published molecularly confirmed TMVII cases. Data on demographics, infection sites, co-infections and treatments were extracted and analysed. A total of 124 TMVII cases from 10 studies were included. Among 60 cases with detailed clinical data, tinea genitalis (36.7%) and tinea faciei/barbae/capitis (51.7%) were the common infection types. TMVII infection predominantly affected men who have sex with men (64%), with high co-infection rates of HIV (29.6%) and gonorrhoea (42.6%). Most cases were reported in France (49%) and Germany (35%), suggesting possible local transmission. Oral terbinafine (250 mg/day for 4-8 weeks) achieved a 64.4% cure rate (38/59 courses), while limited data indicated itraconazole and griseofulvin were also effective. Fluconazole showed no therapeutic efficacy. TMVII can be transmitted through sexual activities, particularly affecting MSM and individuals with concomitant STDs. Current evidence suggests that oral terbinafine is effective, meanwhile other antifungals need further observation. Increased focus is warranted on the clinical management and monitoring of TMVII infection.","Trichophyton mentagrophytes ITS genotype VII (TMVII) has recently been identified as a cause of genital infections, raising concerns about its potential as an emerging sexually transmitted pathogen.

The objective of this study was to explore the factors present at HIV diagnosis associated with the risk of incident dementia. A longitudinal observational study was conducted using a nationwide claim database (2008-2021). A cohort was designed using new diagnosis of HIV infection with antiretroviral therapy. Included in the analysis were individuals aged over 40, with > 3-year follow-up and without a diagnosis of dementia within 2 months post-HIV diagnosis. Dementia was defined as diagnosis and prescription of anti-dementia medication. Cox proportional hazards regression models assessed the association between baseline characteristics and the risk of incident dementia. Among the 13,289 HIV-infected cohort, 3,929 met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 45 (interquartile range [IQR], 15), and 90.9% were male.

Here, we investigate the function of FliS in the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Using loss-of-function studies, combined with biochemical assays and cryo-electron tomography, we demonstrate that FliS deletion selectively reduces FlaB expression, the major flagellin protein, resulting in non-motile mutants with defective flagellar filaments. Mechanistically, we show that FlaB interacts with both FliS and FliW, the latter being an allosteric repressor of the RNA-binding protein CsrA, which inhibits FlaB translation. These four components form a regulatory circuit that fine-tunes FlaB levels and flagellar assembly via a partner-switching mechanism. Deletion of fliS disrupts FlaB secretion, leading to its cytoplasmic accumulation, sequestration of FliW, and subsequent release of CsrA to suppress FlaB synthesis. Accumulation of cytoplasmic FlaB also triggers its degradation to prevent toxicity. Our findings reveal a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism governing flagellar assembly in B. burgdorferi, an evolutionary outlier that lacks the canonical transcriptional cascade controlling flagellar biosynthesis in most bacteria.","The flagellin-specific chaperone FliS has been studied in externally flagellated bacteria; however, its role in spirochetes, a group of bacteria that possess unique internalized flagella (termed endo- or periplasmic flagella), remains unexplored.

To address this, strategies to enhance production yields are urgently needed. This study presents an innovative approach to rAAV production using high cell density (HCD) stirred tank perfusion culture. rAAV1 and rAAV9 vectors carrying GFP cargo were used as models, with triple-plasmid transfection performed in suspension HEK293 cells at a high viable cell density of 50 million cells/mL in culture then maintained at ≥ 30 million cells/mL throughout production. Transfection and production parameters were first optimized in a 5 mL pseudo-perfusion spin tube screening system at HCD. A proof-of-concept was then demonstrated by scaling up to a 200 mL stirred tank bioreactor (STR) in perfusion mode. This intensified process achieved rAAV9 production levels per cell comparable to those observed in reference shake flask cultures at 1 million cells/mL. By implementing transfection at very HCD in a perfusion-based STR, this approach has the potential to significantly enhance rAAV volumetric production capacity, providing a promising solution to meet the growing demand for gene therapies.","Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors are widely used in gene therapies, but the rapidly increasing global demand has created a significant challenge for rAAV manufacturing, where production capacity remains a critical bottleneck.

These lesions contain proteolytic enzymes of likely bacterial origin. This is the first study to demonstrate fungal-bacterial mixed infection in gill lesions of Fusarium-infected kuruma shrimp. Tenacibaculum spp. showing proteolytic activity were isolated from the lesions, whereas Fusarium spp. showed no such activity. Two Tenacibaculum strains were identified as Tenacibaculum mesophilum based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) using MiSeq and GridION. Comparative analysis with the type strain DSM 13764 revealed > 95% nucleotide identity and 82.7% DNA-DNA hybridization similarity, with average genome coverage of 250×. Genomic analysis predicted that the genomes encode multiple protease and antibiotic resistance genes. Histopathology and SEM revealed that Fusarium hyphae had penetrated gill tissue, accompanied by infiltration of blood cells. Both fungal hyphae and T. mesophilum co-localised around gill cells. Bacterial diversity, assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V4 region), declined with tissue disintegration. Immune-related host genes such as anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were upregulated, suggesting innate immune activation. These findings provide novel insights into the disease pathogenesis and contribute to the establishment of early detection systems and biosecurity-based control strategies.","Fusarium disease is an infectious condition that occurs in the cultivation of kuruma shrimp (Penaeus japonicus), primarily presenting as lesions in the gills.

10.1002/jia2.26523,"HIV drug resistance, early treatment outcomes and impact of guidelines compliance after protease inhibitor-based second-line failure in a dedicated resistance clinic in western Kenya: a retrospective cohort study.","Data on drug resistance, viral outcomes and guidelines compliance following protease inhibitor (PI)-based second-line failure in low- and middle-income countries are limited, particularly in the era of dolutegravir-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART). We conducted a retrospective cohort study of people living with HIV (PLWH) ≥3 years old with second-line viral failure (VF, ≥1000 copies/ml) at the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare from 2011 to 2021. We assessed resistance prevalence and patterns at second-line VF, stratified by PI (atazanavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir), and examined correlations of resistance and treatment strategies with VF at 6-18 months post-genotype. Analyses employed inverse probability weighting, adjusting for calendar year, age, gender, ART duration, PI at genotyping and class-specific resistance, and considered guidelines-supported versus unsupported strategies. Of 187 participants (median age 41 years, 54% female, 41% on atazanavir/ritonavir, 59% on lopinavir/ritonavir-based ART), 91% had any resistance (NRTI 79%, NNRTI 80%, major PI 37%, dual-class 36%, triple-class 37%). Predicted resistance to third-line options was 67% for etravirine or rilpivirine and 10% for darunavir/ritonavir. Despite higher resistance detected on atazanavir/ritonavir versus lopinavir/ritonavir, predicted darunavir/ritonavir resistance was similar. At median 9 months post-genotype, 95% of 173 participants with available data were on a guidelines-supported regimen (55% second-line; 45% third-line, 86% dolutegravir-based), of whom 28% had post-genotype VF. Of the 5% not on guidelines-supported regimens, 71% had post-genotype VF. Adjusted odds of VF were higher for guidelines-unsupported versus supported regimens (OR = 4.52; 95% CI 1.02-26.24), and odds of VF were 97% lower for those on third-line versus second-line (OR = 0.07; 95% CI 0.02-0.20). We found high levels of drug resistance and early VF following PI-based second-line failure in Kenya. Treatment guidelines compliance and switches to third-line, even within guidelines recommendations, improved early viral outcomes. Findings highlight the vulnerability of PLWH with advanced ART experience and resistance profiles, and the importance of following guidelines and improving access to third-line and drug resistance testing, particularly in the new ART era.","Data on drug resistance, viral outcomes and guidelines compliance following protease inhibitor (PI)-based second-line failure in low- and middle-income countries are limited, particularly in the era of dolutegravir-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Particle heterogeneity, specifically particle DNA of varying types and sizes, significantly affects recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) performance. Previous studies have identified particle-associated DNAs; however, the specific DNA composition of these mixed populations remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the DNA composition of the isolated subpopulations of rAAV particles obtained through anion exchange (AEX) chromatography. RAAV2-ZsGreen1 particles were fractionated on an AEX column, resulting in 12 distinct fractions. We analyzed the DNA composition of these fractions using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and MiSeq to identify the incorporated DNA heterogeneity in them. Our findings illustrated a clear trend in which the DNA content increasing in fractions was associated with an increased rAAV genomic DNA ratio of total particle DNA. The particle DNA content increased significantly across fractions from Peak 1 to Peak 2, showing approximately 30,000- and 5000-fold increases for ZsGreen1 (rAAV genome) and amp<sup>R</sup> (plasmid impurity), respectively. Notably, in the empty particle subpopulations, the rate of detectable DNA molecules was lower than one DNA fragment per 100 particles, with inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequences being the most prevalent. With the elucidated profile of particle DNAs, this study provides detailed information on particle heterogeneity, shedding light on empty and partial particle formation and impurity DNA incorporation.","Safe and effective adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are essential for gene therapy.

The HPV vaccine is a proven intervention for preventing high-risk HPV infections and associated cancers. This serial cross-sectional study conducted in Shanghai, China, in 2019 and 2024 analyzed changes in HPV vaccination rates and vaccine hesitancy. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the associations between HPV vaccination, general vaccine hesitancy, and HPV-specific vaccine hesitancy, adjusting for sociodemographic factors. The Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) quantified the proportion of non-vaccination attributable to these factors. In 2019 and 2024, two waves of data were collected from 1,037 and 1,450 parents, respectively. Results showed an increase in HPV vaccination from 6% to 30% during the study period, primarily among women aged 18 and older, while coverage among the WHO target group (girls aged 9-14) remained low at 8%. Parents with HPV-specific vaccine hesitancy were 75% less likely to vaccinate their daughters (OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.11-0.56), while general vaccine hesitancy reduced vaccination likelihood by 94% (OR = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.00-0.89).

The assay plates (M9 or Luria Broth [LB] media with 500 mM salt) were overlaid with a thin layer of top agar containing Toluidine Blue as the indicator and salmon sperm DNA as the substrate. Primary screening of halophiles was based on their zone of clearance. Secondary screening of the isolates involved assaying the supernatants using a well-diffusion assay. The isolates were further screened and validated by ammonium sulfate fractionation of the cell-free supernatants to enrich the secreted nuclease. The three-step method narrowed down nine potential isolates from ∼500 bacterial colonies, of which SH1 demonstrated nuclease activity, discernibly due to a secreted extracellular enzyme(s). Further characterization of this enriched nuclease(s) showed that it is likely made up of multiple peptides/subunits, acts as an endo- as well as exonuclease, degrades both DNA and RNA, is Mg<sup>+2</sup> dependent, has a wide range of salt tolerance from 80-1500 mM, is optimally active at 37°C, and is stable against reducing agents. This validates the screening strategy thus opening doors to further bioengineering of novel nucleases from other extremophiles.","This study reports the development of a 3-step strategy that is both cost-effective and quick to screen marine organisms and validate the presence of extracellular nucleases.

10.1002/biot.70019,Expanding the Spectrum: Modified Bacteriocin Nisin as a Trojan Horse Against Gram-Negative Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli.,"Nisin is an antimicrobial peptide widely used as a biopreservative to extend shelf life and control foodborne pathogens, particularly Gram-positive bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes. However, its efficacy against Gram-negative bacteria is limited due to its inability to penetrate their outer membrane and reach its target, lipid II, in the inner membrane. Agents that alter the outer membrane's permeability can overcome this limitation, enabling nisin to access the periplasm and expand its antimicrobial spectrum. In this study, we aimed to extend nisin's spectrum of action towards Gram-negative bacteria by fusing it with salmochelin, a siderophore produced by Salmonella. Siderophores capture extracellular iron and enter cells through specific receptors. The nisin-salmochelin conjugate was synthesized through an external chemical reaction, yielding a compound with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, notable strains include Salmonella enterica Newport, S. enterica Typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157, E. coli EC3 (uropathogenic isolate), and Providencia rettgeri. This novel conjugate exhibits broad-spectrum activity against foodborne pathogens, significantly enhancing nisin's potential as a food biopreservative and expanding its clinical applications.","Nisin is an antimicrobial peptide widely used as a biopreservative to extend shelf life and control foodborne pathogens, particularly Gram-positive bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes.

While neutralizing antibodies are effective at preventing viral entry, virus-specific CD8⁺ T cells play a vital role in eliminating infected cells and inducing an antiviral state, which curbs disease progression. Among these, CD8⁺ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells persist long term in the lungs, where they serve as first responders and rapidly expand upon secondary respiratory virus infection to provide local protection. The establishment and maintenance of lung CD8⁺ TRM cells require not only local cytokine signals but also antigen presentation. Specific subsets of antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, alveolar macrophages, monocytes, and endothelial cells also influence the quality and durability of CD8⁺ TRM cell responses. This review summarizes key findings on CD8⁺ T cell dynamics during respiratory viral infections, with a particular focus on CD8⁺ TRM cell formation and function. We also highlight the importance of local antigen presentation in driving TRM development and discuss how this knowledge can inform vaccine strategies aimed at eliciting robust, long-lasting mucosal immunity.","The respiratory mucosa, encompassing the lungs and nasal tissues, serves as the primary barrier against respiratory viruses.

10.1002/ctm2.70353,MLKL‒OPTN axis regulates herpesvirus-induced neurological sequelae.,"Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infections are lifelong and linked to neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), yet the underlying mechanisms in the host remain poorly understood. This study investigates new molecular dynamics following HSV-1 infection, uncovering the pivotal role of the mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein. Beyond its known function in necroptosis, MLKL was found to control HSV-1 transport into the nucleus, tightly regulated by Optineurin (OPTN). We evidenced an essential regulatory interaction between MLKL and OPTN, governing MLKL's activity in both necroptosis-dependent and independent pathways. In vivo, studies using Optn knockout mice demonstrated how this MLKL-OPTN axis contributes to demyelination and neurological symptoms mimicking MS. This axis critically prevents oligodendrocyte death and the associated demyelination during HSV-1 infection. Furthermore, pharmacological interventions with Necrosulfonamide (NSA), an MLKL inhibitor, showed therapeutic potential in preserving myelin integrity and reducing neurological deficits in HSV-1-infected models, suggesting a viable strategy for managing virus-induced neurodegeneration. Our findings highlight the significant role of MLKL in HSV-1 pathogenesis and suggest that MLKL dysregulation is a key mechanism behind severe neurological damage. MLKL plays a significant role in regulating endosomal transport of HSV-1 to nucleus during early stages of infection. Formation of p-MLKL bodies during HSV-1 infection leads to death of oligodendrocyte and subsequent demyelination. OPTN can negatively modulate MLKL levels to restrict infection and consequential oligodendrocyte death during HSV-1 infection.","Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infections are lifelong and linked to neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), yet the underlying mechanisms in the host remain poorly understood.

Reports show the presence of microplastics in water, soil, aqueous organisms, and even human tissues and blood. This study investigates the impact of microplastics on bacteriophages, i.e., viruses that play crucial roles in regulating microbial communities and maintaining ecological balance. Since bacteriophages lyse up to 40% of bacterial populations daily, their role in environmental stability is paramount. We demonstrate that microplastics can reduce the apparent number of active bacteria in aquatic environments. To explore the interaction between microplastics and bacteriophages, we examine the effects of various microplastic types (polystyrene, poly(vinyl chloride), polyethylene, and polyethylene terephthalate) and size ranges of particles on phages of varying morphologies (tailed T4, filamentous M13, and icosahedral MS2). Additionally, we assess the influence of bacterial debris, representing organic matter, on the heteroaggregation of microplastic particles and phages. Our findings reveal a significant decline of up to 99.99% in active phages, underscoring the profound effects of microplastics on phage dynamics. These results provide critical insights into the complex interactions between microplastics and phages, highlighting the need for urgent action to address microplastic pollution.","Microplastics, pervasive environmental contaminants, attract significant attention due to their detrimental effects across ecosystems.

When supplemented in avian diet, Inonotus obliquus has proved to be beneficial. However, information regarding these effects on mammals is scanty. The present study aims to investigate the effect of supplementation of Inonotus obliquus fermentation product (IOFP) on the growth performance, antioxidant capacity, meat quality, intestinal function and gut microbiota of rabbit exploratorily, which may act as an important feed additive and also as an antibiotic alternative with its medicinal properties. Dietary supplementation of IOFP increased body weight (P < 0.01) at the initial 21 d and improved feed efficiency throughout the 35 d experimental period when compared to control group. At the same time it was observed that meat quality and carcass parameters improved upon supplementation of IOFP. Additionally, IOFP supplementation resulted in significant increases (P < 0.05) in total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and nitric oxide (NO) activity or concentration in the serum and muscle. The crypt depth decreased significantly, whereas the villus height/crypt depth (V/C) value increased (P < 0.05). The concentration of secrete IgA (sIgA) of the intestine also increased (P < 0.05). IOFP supplementation significantly increased the fold change expression of Claudin 1, Occludin, ZO1, and ZO2 (P < 0.05) when compared to the respective gene expression levels of the duodenum and jejunum tissues of control group. Further study on cecum microbiota revealed that IOFP supplementation increased the microbiota diversity by increasing the number of beneficial bacteria and reducing the numbers of pathological bacteria. It was observed that cecum metabolites produced in the treated group were related to antioxidants, antiinflammation and antidepressive effects. The harmful metabolites related to fat deposition, loss of appetite and cytotoxic conditions decreased. Pearson's correlation studies between different bacteria and metabolites revealed that the metabolites produced were regulated by the beneficial and harmful bacteria respectively. IOFP enhanced intestinal morphology and function, and organismic antioxidant capacity, probably by increasing the concentration of beneficial microbiota and metabolites resulting in improvement of body weight, feed efficiency, and parameters related to meat quality and carcass traits of rabbits.","Inonotus obliquus is a medicinal edible fungus that contains a variety of biologically active ingredients and has multiple physiological effects.

Though extensive research has been done in recent decades, the prevention and control of T. gondii continue to present substantial challenges. Herbal medicines have long been a rich source of chemical entities and may provide new avenues for drug discovery against T. gondii. Thus, this study was performed to investigate the anti-T. gondii effect of two monomers, beta, beta-dimethylacrylshikonin (DMAS) and isobutyrylshikonin (IBS), extracted from the roots of a widely distributed and used medical plant. The cytotoxicity of DMAS and IBS on Vero cells was evaluated using the MTT assay, and the toxicity in mice was assessed on the basis of the changes of body weight combined with the histopathologic examinations on spleen, liver, and kidney. The effects of DMAS and IBS on mice against T. gondii acute infection were evaluated by combining survival curves with splenic histopathologic examination. Ultrastructural change in T. gondii tachyzoites post co-incubation in vitro was observed by electron microscopy. ACT1-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was conducted to quantify T. gondii tachyzoites, including proliferation and the inhibitory efficacy of DMAS and IBS. Invasion and attachment, intracellular proliferation, and parasitophorous vacuole viability evaluations were conducted to assess the effects on the asexual life cycle of T. gondii. In addition, untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed to clarify the underlying mechanisms by which DMAS and IBS act against this parasite. Both DMAS and IBS, with higher half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC<sub>50</sub>) values, exhibited concentration-dependent cytotoxicity in Vero cells and significantly inhibited the intracellular proliferation of T. gondii in vitro, showing lower half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values and higher selectivity index (SI) values. DMAS showed a statistically more potent effect than IBS, but both were not significantly more potent than that of pyrimethamine (PM). The tachyzoites exhibited severe ultrastructural damage following treatment with DMAS or IBS. Metabolomics analysis indicated that this abnormal biological lesion was caused by the disruptions in purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways in T. gondii, with mechanisms likely differing from that of PM. In vivo, a dose of 1.5 mg/kg of DMAS showed no significant toxicity in Kunming (KM) mice, with no significant pathological damage or weight loss. At this dosage, both DMAS and IBS significantly alleviated the splenic hyperemia and statistically prolonged the survival times of T. gondii-infected mice. This study demonstrated that DMAS and IBS have an inhibitory effect on T. gondii infection in vitro and in vivo, probably associated with the disruption of nucleotide metabolism in the parasite. These results highlight that the two monomers, in particular DMAS, hold promise as a potential therapeutic medicine for toxoplasmosis.","Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread parasite that can infect almost all vertebrate species including humans, causing variable clinical symptoms from asymptomatic infection to serious diseases.

While traditionally considered B cell specific, studies have reported that Ig is also expressed by non-B cells. However, it is not known to what extent Ig is expressed in the brain and which type of variable regions are expressed. In this study, we elucidated the expression profile of Igs from embryonic to adult stages using single-cell RNA sequencing data and Ig repertoire analysis. Our results revealed that microglia express Ighm transcripts from embryonic to adult stages. These transcripts contain the upstream region of the Ighj region. In addition, Ighm is expressed in the layer 6 corticothalamic neurons, some of which co-express Ighg2c in the adult brain. In particular, we were able to generate a comprehensive profile of Ig variable region expression from embryonic to adult stages. Furthermore, the response of Ighm expression in microglia to lipopolysaccharide is markedly different from that in B cells, suggesting a novel, brain-specific role for the Ig gene, distinct from its classical function in the immune system.","Immunoglobulin (Ig) is a critical molecule in the body's defense against foreign substances such as bacteria and viruses.

However, the current detection methods still have various deficiencies that limit their field application. Here, a cell-free expression system relying on nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) with toehold switch sensors and a visual reporter for color change was developed and introduced for TuMV detection in P. heterophylla. After designing and screening the approach, the selected sensitive sensor was able to detect 1 pM TuMV RNA fragments within 40 min, and the detection limit was less than 10 fM if the time was extended to 90 min. The sensor exhibited high specificity, with no cross-reactivity detected when tested against cucumber mosaic virus, another prevalent viral pathogen in P. heterophylla.

The findings can help to better tailor interventions for reducing HIV transmission and improving public health outcomes. A cross-sectional design was employed, utilizing anonymous questionnaires administered throughout 2022. Participants were individuals attending rapid serological testing sessions for HIV organized by third-sector associations in Turin, Northern Italy. The sample comprised 795 participants who attended HIV testing sessions. Data were collected via paper-based questionnaires (n = 495), later digitized for analysis. Descriptive statistics, univariate, and logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine socio-demographic characteristics, risk behaviors, and testing outcomes. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a Markov model stratifying patients by CD4 + levels to assess QALYs and direct healthcare costs. The study achieved a high HIV testing rate of 99.9%, with a positivity rate of 0.5%. All individuals with reactive tests were successfully linked to care. Syphilis testing had a lower uptake (76.7%) and identified a positivity rate of 0.7%. Significant demographic and behavioral differences were found: previously tested participants are more likely to be older (p < 0.001, OR = 1.15) than first-time testers, more likely to be MSM (Men who have Sex with Men) than MSF (Men who have Sex with Female) and FSM (Female who has Sex with Male) (p < 0.001, OR = 0.132; p < 0.001, OR = 0.183); and are more likely to have had a history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)(p = 0.003, OR = 0.128). Immediate HIV diagnosis and access to antiviral therapy reduce healthcare costs by €3,841 per patient, with total savings of €23,808 due to lower treatment expenses before immunodeficiency onset.

Syphilis testing had a lower uptake (76.7%) and identified a positivity rate of 0.7%. Significant demographic and behavioral differences were found: previously tested participants are more likely to be older (p < 0.001, OR = 1.15) than first-time testers, more likely to be MSM (Men who have Sex with Men) than MSF (Men who have Sex with Female) and FSM (Female who has Sex with Male) (p < 0.001, OR = 0.132; p < 0.001, OR = 0.183); and are more likely to have had a history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)(p = 0.003, OR = 0.128). Immediate HIV diagnosis and access to antiviral therapy reduce healthcare costs by €3,841 per patient, with total savings of €23,808 due to lower treatment expenses before immunodeficiency onset. CBVCT programs in Turin demonstrated high feasibility and effectiveness in engaging the target population and ensuring linkage to care. However, syphilis testing requires greater integration. The findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to address disparities in testing behaviors and reinforce the economic sustainability of early HIV diagnosis and treatment.",PubMed

Protein docking and pull-down assays assessed G/F-PBP interactions. In vitro RSV-S.pn co-culture experiments evaluated β-lactam susceptibility (MIC determination). We retrospectively analyzed 2012-2021 antimicrobial resistance data from 1-59-month-old community-acquired pneumonia patients at Chongqing Medical University Children's Hospital with confirmed S.pn and/or RSV nasopharyngeal carriage. Computational modeling revealed low G/F-PBP binding affinity (iPTM < 0.6), corroborated by absent PBP1a interaction in pull-down assays. RSV exposure did not alter S.pn β-lactam MICs (penicillin/amoxicillin ≤ 2 µg/mL; cefepime/cefotaxime ≤ 1 µg/mL; meropenem ≤ 0.25 µg/mL). Retrospective data showed elevated penicillin resistance in RSV + S.pn co-detections vs. S.pn alone during 2012 (2.8% vs. 40.9%), 2017 (2.8% vs. 30.4%), and 2018 (6.2% vs. 38.6%) (all p < 0.001). No RSV-associated resistance increases occurred for amoxicillin, cephalosporins, or meropenem. RSV demonstrates negligible impact on S.pn β-lactam resistance mechanisms, elevated resistance rates to amoxicillin and cephalosporins necessitate enhanced antimicrobial stewardship through diagnostic-guided prescribing and resistance surveillance to optimize β-lactam efficacy in pediatric care.","This study characterizes the molecular interplay between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) glycoproteins (G/F) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.pn) penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), while evaluating RSV's potential role in modulating S.pn β-lactam resistance.

Similarly, nanosilver fluoride (NSF) is effective against caries. However, there are limited comparisons between both agents, especially regarding their antibacterial effect. This randomized controlled clinical trial aimed to compare the effects of SDF and NSF on salivary bacterial counts in children with ECC. Fifty 4-6-year-olds presenting with active dentin caries (ICDAS code 5) in primary teeth were randomly allocated to two groups. Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) and Lactobacilli in unstimulated saliva were cultivated on differential media and counted as colony-forming units. Followed by the application of either 38% SDF or NSF. Saliva samples were recollected after one month. The legal guardians completed a detailed questionnaire assessing their child's dental hygiene habits, dental pain experience, and socioeconomic background. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to assess the effects of both agents on bacterial counts while accounting for confounders. The mean age of participants was 4.8 ± 0.8 years, with the majority (96%, N = 48) presenting with severe ECC. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding age, sex, dmft score, socioeconomic background, dental hygiene habits, or dental experience. After one month, within-group analysis showed a significant reduction in S. mutans only in the NSF group (p = 0.002) and significant decreases in Lactobacilli counts in both SDF and NSF groups (p < 0.05). However, between-group comparisons revealed no significant differences in the reduction of S. mutans (1.4% and 6.0%, respectively, p = 0.192) or Lactobacilli counts (6.0% and 6.0%, respectively, p = 0.754). Regression analyses revealed non-significant odds of reduced bacterial counts after NSF application compared to SDF. After one application, children with ECC showed significant decrease in salivary bacteria, with no difference between the two agents regarding their antibacterial effect. NSF can serve as a viable option in ECC management in that it provides comparable antibacterial effects to 38% SDF without inducing tooth discoloration.

Recognizing EMs, which may involve multiple organs and systems, is crucial for timely diagnosis and effective antiviral therapy. Purpose of the study was to investigate extrahepatic symptoms occurring in the oral mucosa in HCV-infected patients. The observational study included 153 consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis C and healthy controls. Data collection encompassed demographic parameters, medical history, laboratory results, and oral examinations, which included evaluation of dry mouth, pain and burning in the mouth and on the tongue, pain in the angles of the mouth, bad breath, gingival bleeding, dysphagia and taste disorders using scales designed for this purpose, clinical and dental examination. Subjective oral symptoms were twice as common in the study group as in controls with the most frequent dry mouth, followed by oral pain, and burning in the mouth. Pathological changes (oral candidiasis, angular cheilitis and lichen planus), were identified in 73.2% of patients, compared to 32% in the control group. Oral hygiene was worse in the study group with a median score of 1.8 compared to 1.1 as assessed by the Oral Hygiene Index scale. The incidence of Mikulicz's aphthae, papillomas, fibromas and sublingual varices did not reach statistically significant differences. The study group had fewer teeth with dental fillings. Additionally, age ≥ 40 years and GT1 infection were identified as independent predictors of oral pathologies in HCV-infected patients. In patients with chronic HCV infection, oral mucosal pathologies were significantly more common compared to controls, with candidiasis, angular cheilitis, and oral lichen planus being the most frequently observed conditions. Subjective symptoms such as dry mouth, oral pain, and burning were also markedly higher in the HCV group.

10.1007/s13304-025-02233-x,DNA methylation changes in thyroid cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.,"The impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on thyroid cancer at the genomic level remains poorly understood. The purpose of our study was to determine whether significant DNA methylation changes occur in thyroid cancer tissues from patients with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Surgically resected normal thyroid and Papillary (PTC) tissues from three COVID-19-infected PTC patients (Cases) and three prepandemic PTC patients (Controls) were analyzed using DNA methylation EPIC arrays. Differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified in normal thyroid and PTC tissues. Functional enrichment analysis was subsequently performed to explore the affected pathways. COVID-19-infected PTC tissues presented distinct DNA methylation profiles, with 6,848 DMPs in PTC tissues compared with 140 in normal thyroid tissues. SARS-CoV-2 infection did not significantly affect normal thyroid tissue by methylation. SARS-CoV-2 infection in PTC tissues was associated with hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes (RUNX3, PAOX), the Wnt signaling pathway, the HOX gene family, cell adhesion-related genes and hypomethylation in response to virus-related genes. The key DMRs identified in PTC included GPR75, CCDC80, and ENTPD3, suggesting altered cell adhesion, tumor proliferation, and immune evasion. SARS-CoV-2 infection is linked to significant DNA methylation alterations in PTC tissues, with potential implications for tumor progression and aggressiveness. These findings suggest that COVID-19 may influence thyroid cancer biology. Further research is needed to validate these epigenetic modifications, establish causal relationships and determine their clinical relevance.","The impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on thyroid cancer at the genomic level remains poorly understood.

In the search for new genetic sources of resistance, we focused on OsRPM1 (LOC Os12g30070.1), a rice gene encoding a coiled-coil nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR) protein, structurally similar to well-characterized resistance (R) proteins in Arabidopsis and other plant species. Although its role in rice immunity was previously uncharacterized, transcriptomic profiling revealed that OsRPM1 is significantly upregulated in a type III secretion system (T3SS)-dependent manner during infection with the virulent Xoo race 4, suggesting a pathogen-responsive defence function. To evaluate this, we employed virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to transiently suppress its expression in rice. Silencing OsRPM1 increased susceptibility to Xoo, resulting in more severe disease symptoms, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and impaired callose deposition; key defence responses linked to effective resistance. These findings demonstrate that OsRPM1 acts as a positive regulator of rice defence and support its potential as a candidate for broad-spectrum, durable resistance breeding.","Bacterial blight (BB), caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is a major constraint to rice production in humid tropical regions.

The objective of the study was to evaluate all-cause LTC, annual costs and healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) among persons with HIV (PWH) versus a matched non-HIV cohort in the United States (US). This observational study included persons (≥ 18 years) with an HIV diagnosis, antiretroviral treatment (ART), and continuous enrollment (CE) within each year (2018-2023) in the PWH cohort, and with no HIV diagnosis/ART and CE in the non-HIV cohort, identified using a US commercial claims database (IQVIA PharMetrics<sup>®</sup> Plus). Cohorts were matched 1:3 on age, sex, geographic region, and health plan. Undiscounted LTC, discounted LTC (95% confidence interval [CI]) and annual costs were computed in 2022 US dollars (USD) for ages 18-75 years. Annual inpatient, outpatient, emergency room, and outpatient pharmacy utilization and costs were compared. Person counts ranged from 45,465 to 54,530 in the PWH cohort and 136,395 to 163,590 in the non-HIV cohort from 2018 to 2023.

Despite its presumed importance, the loss of If1 in various model organisms does not cause severe phenotypes, suggesting its role may be confined to specific stress or metabolic conditions yet to be discovered. Our analyses indicate that inhibitory peptides are crucial in mitigating mitochondrial depolarizing stress under glyco-oxidative metabolic conditions.

This study aimed to isolate polyethylene-degrading bacteria from marine samples containing plastic waste. Four culturable bacterial isolates: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Actinomyces sp. were assessed for their biofilm formation, biosurfactant, and protease production. Gamma irradiation was used to induce structural changes and promote bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on low-density polyethylene microplastics (LDPE MPs). Optimal biofilm formation was achieved in minimal media supplemented with 30% tryptic soy broth, 10% biosurfactant, and 300 µM calcium chloride. The factorial design experiment demonstrated that adding media supplementation significantly improved bacterial colonization and biofilm formation when compared to gamma irradiation. This was supported with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping, and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The optimized LDPE MP degradation was achieved through a multi-step protocol: (1) samples are pre-treated to 40 kGy gamma irradiation, which resulted in 5.7% Gravimetric weight loss and structural and morphological changes, (2) incubation in biofilm inducing media overnight, and (3) further incubation in minimal media for 30 days. This approach resulted in a total weight loss of 22.5%. In conclusion, synergistic pre-treatment is recommended to promote biofilm and improve biodegradation of LDPE MPs by marine bacteria.","The accumulation of plastic waste presents a significant worldwide environmental challenge.

These diverse phenotypes are believed to allow the virus to overcome various immunological and pulmonary barriers during entry into the airway epithelium, and to influence the viral entry pathway. Notably, laboratory-adapted IAV strains predominantly adopt a spherical form, yet the factors driving this preference as well as the factors favoring filamentous morphology in physiological settings remain unclear. To address this, we generated fluorescent reporter viruses with identical surface glycoproteins but distinct morphologies and developed a correlative light and scanning electron microscopy workflow. This enabled us to investigate the impact of viral morphology on spread, and to identify conditions favoring either form. Our findings demonstrate that filamentous IAV spread significantly slower in various cell lines, consistent with delayed entry kinetics and in-cell cryo-electron tomography, explaining the predominance of spherical forms in laboratory-adapted strains. Cellular junction integrity, neuraminidase activity, and mucin do not inhibit IAV spread in a morphology-dependent manner. However, filamentous virions confer a selective advantage under neutralizing-antibody pressure against hemagglutinin.","Influenza A viruses (IAV) display a broad variety of morphologies ranging from spherical to long filamentous virus particles.

10.1007/s00018-025-05757-y,Insights into platelet factor 4-derived peptide macrocycles; the mechanistic basis of their rapid and selective antiplasmodial actions.,"The malarial parasite Plasmodium can acquire resistance to most mainstay antimalarial drugs, necessitating the development of new antiplasmodial agents with different modes of action. The innate defense protein, human platelet factor 4 (PF4), has a unique antiplasmodial action that involves selective entry into Plasmodium-infected red blood cells (RBC) and subsequent destruction of the parasite's digestive vacuole (DV). This activity is recapitulated in PF4-derived internalization peptides (PDIPs). Here, we characterized the actions of PDIP analogs and PF4 in live P. falciparum-infected human RBC to understand their kinetics, effects on cell and parasite viability, and molecular requirements for antiplasmodial activity. The entry and accumulation of PDIP, and peptide-induced DV destruction, were distinguishable as ordered and rapidly occurring events that were equivalent to PF4. Both host cell and parasite plasma membranes remained intact and undamaged following destruction of the DV, although modest changes in phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure on the surface of the host cells (indicative of changes to its phospholipid organization) and swelling (but not lysis) of the intracellular parasite were observed. PDIP retained its macrocyclic structure, and its activity depended on elevated levels of PS on the surface of infected versus uninfected cells. Neither the intramolecular disulfide bond of PDIP, nor the parasite's nutrient and ion transporter functions were required. These actions on the parasite DV were not detected for other antiplasmodial drugs and compounds. In conclusion, this study reveals the unique, rapid, and distinct antiplasmodial actions of PDIP, highlighting its potential for future antimalarial development.","The malarial parasite Plasmodium can acquire resistance to most mainstay antimalarial drugs, necessitating the development of new antiplasmodial agents with different modes of action. The innate defense protein, human platelet factor 4 (PF4), has a unique antiplasmodial action that involves selective entry into Plasmodium-infected red blood cells (RBC) and subsequent destruction of the parasite's digestive vacuole (DV). This activity is recapitulated in PF4-derived internalization peptides (PDIPs). Here, we characterized the actions of PDIP analogs and PF4 in live P. falciparum-infected human RBC to understand their kinetics, effects on cell and parasite viability, and molecular requirements for antiplasmodial activity. The entry and accumulation of PDIP, and peptide-induced DV destruction, were distinguishable as ordered and rapidly occurring events that were equivalent to PF4. Both host cell and parasite plasma membranes remained intact and undamaged following destruction of the DV, although modest changes in phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure on the surface of the host cells (indicative of changes to its phospholipid organization) and swelling (but not lysis) of the intracellular parasite were observed. PDIP retained its macrocyclic structure, and its activity depended on elevated levels of PS on the surface of infected versus uninfected cells. Neither the intramolecular disulfide bond of PDIP, nor the parasite's nutrient and ion transporter functions were required. These actions on the parasite DV were not detected for other antiplasmodial drugs and compounds. In conclusion, this study reveals the unique, rapid, and distinct antiplasmodial actions of PDIP, highlighting its potential for future antimalarial development.",PubMed

Here we report that the powdery mildew resistance gene MLIW170/PM26 in wild emmer and bread wheat derivatives is determined by a genetically linked atypical NLR pair TdCNL1/TdCNL5. Map-based cloning and PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing revealed that TdCNL1 encodes an atypical coiled-coil-domain-containing NLR protein (CNL) fused with a new potassium-dependent sodium-calcium exchanger integrated domain, whereas TdCNL5 encodes a canonical CNL protein. Mutagenesis and virus-induced gene silencing experiments indicated that both TdCNL1 and TdCNL5 are essential for powdery mildew resistance. Transgenic plants with TdCNL1 alone or TdCNL1/TdCNL5 together show resistance, whereas Fielder with TdCNL5 alone was susceptible. Geographically, MLIW170/PM26 occurs in a few Southern populations of wild emmer wheat. Our study highlights an atypical NLR pair coordinately regulating powdery mildew resistance and provides a diversified resistance gene resource for wheat improvement.","Resistance to wheat powdery mildew is commonly mediated by individual resistance proteins, most of which encode nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors.

However, well-characterised circuit components that sense health- and disease-relevant conditions within the gut remain limited. Here, we extend the flexibility and power of a biosensor screening platform using bacterial memory circuits. We construct libraries of sensory components sourced from diverse gut bacteria using a bespoke two-component system identification and cloning pipeline. Tagging unique strains using a hypervariable DNA barcode enables parallel tracking of thousands of unique clones, corresponding to ~150 putative biosensors, in a single experiment. Evaluating sensor activity and performance heterogeneity across various in vitro and in vivo conditions using mouse models, we identify several biosensors of interest. Validated hits include biosensors with relevance for autonomous control of synthetic functions within the mammalian gut and for non-invasive monitoring of inflammatory disease using faecal sampling. This approach will promote rapid biosensor engineering to advance the development of synthetic biology tools for deployment within complex environments.","Synthetic biology approaches such as whole-cell biosensing and 'sense-and-respond' therapeutics aim to enlist the vast sensing repertoire of gut microbes to drive cutting-edge clinical and research applications.

Crucially, DENV vaccines must be tetravalent to provide protection against all four serotypes because immunity to only one serotype can enhance infections caused by heterologous serotypes. Uneven replication of live-attenuated viruses in tetravalent vaccines can lead to disease enhancement instead of protection. Subunit vaccines are a promising alternative as the vaccine components are not dependent on viral replication and antigen doses can be controlled to achieve a balanced response. Here, we show that a tetravalent subunit vaccine of dengue envelope (E) proteins computationally stabilized to form native-like dimers elicits type-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice against all four serotypes. The immune response was enhanced by displaying the E dimers on liposomes embedded with adjuvant, and no interference was detected between the four components.","The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1-4) are a major health concern putting 50% of the global population at risk of infection.

In this study, we isolated and characterized a CD4 binding site (CD4bs) antibody, FD22, from an elite neutralizer in China who had been infected with a clade B virus through contaminated blood plasma for 23 years. The heavy chain of FD22 was derived from a rarely reported IGHV3-30 germline gene and exhibited an exceptionally high degree of somatic hypermutation (SHM) (37%), along with a long and unique CDRH3 loop of 20-amino acids. FD22 exhibited potent and broad neutralizing activity, comparable to that of the well-known bNAb VRC01. It effectively neutralized 82% of a panel of 145 diverse HIV-1 pseudoviruses, including the two major circulating strains in China, CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC. FD22 bound strongly to HIV-1-infected cell lines, efficiently engaged FcγRIIIa receptors, triggered NK cell degranulation and the release of key cytokines such as IFN-γ and β-chemokines, and robustly induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against HIV-1-infected target cells. Structural prediction for FD22 and the HIV Env SOSIP trimer performed by AlphaFold3, site-mutagenesis, and autologous virus reverse mutation assays revealed that the epitope of FD22 spans key CD4 binding site, including Loop D, the CD4 binding loop (CD4 BLP), and the V5 Loop. The unique long CDRH3 loop of FD22 interacts with the CD4 binding site through its negatively charged residue R102, distinguishing it from other CD4bs antibodies. Our findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of FD22 in viral neutralization and ADCC.

This study examines the physical role of the matrix in preventing recolonisation using a mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa ΔmucA) and isogenic wild-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. We investigated the recolonisation of pre-formed live biofilms and the residual matrix left behind after bacterial eradication with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). P. aeruginosa ΔmucA, which overproduces alginate, prevented recolonisation through swelling and increased elastic modulus. In contrast, the wild-type P. aeruginosa biofilm matrix exhibited minimal swelling and decreased elasticity, suggesting crosslink breakage. These observations align with polymer physics theories where alginate's polyelectrolyte nature drives swelling through the Donnan effect, enhancing matrix stability. Meanwhile, the Psl-rich wild-type matrix limited swelling but showed reduced mechanical stability. This study underscores the critical role of matrix composition in biofilm mechanics, influencing bacterial protection regardless of viability.","Biofilms are viscoelastic gels with a cross-linked network of biopolymers forming an extracellular matrix that protects bacteria from most antimicrobial treatments.

Therefore, it is necessary to modify the HIAP to improve the texture of fermented soymilk gel. High-pressure homogenization (HPH) is an effective food processing technique and can potentially alter the HIAP conformation. A strain of lactic acid bacteria suitable for fermentation of soymilk was initially screened in this work. Subsequently, soymilk was treated with HPH to investigate the effect of the HPH treatment on HIAP and the gel structure after fermentation. The results demonstrated that HPH treatment led to a significant reduction in particle size (from 425.2 nm to 283.2 nm), protein dispersibility index, and zeta potential of HIAP. Additionally, the multispectral analysis revealed that the spatial structure of HIAP unfolded with increased content of β-sheet and a reduction in random coil in the secondary structure. Furthermore, the formation of a homogeneous and dense three-dimensional network structure of gel was prompted by an increase in hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds between the proteins, which not only enhanced the rheology and texture of the gel but also elevated its water-holding capacity from 45.4 % to 61.3 %.

10.1016/j.aca.2025.344270,PED-TRFIA: PEDV early on-site detection based on the time-resolved fluorescence ImmunoAssay.,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infections have a significant impact on the global pig industry. To address the need for on-site detection of PEDV, the paper-based lateral flow immunoassay offers a promising approach, characterized by its simplicity of operation, rapid detection capabilities, and the elimination of expensive instrumentation. However, commonly used signal labels, such as colloidal gold nanoparticles and quantum dots have limitations in sensitivity. To overcome this issue, our study developed a PEDV early on-site detection method based on the Time-Resolved Fluorescence ImmunoAssay (PED-TRFIA), specifically designed to detect PEDV antigens of both the PEDV GI and GII genotypes. PED-TRFIA demonstrated a lower limit of detection (LOD) up to 9.76 × 10<sup>2</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL, which is 64 times higher than that of commercial kits. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent selectivity, as evaluated using various control samples such as PRRSV, PRV, TGEV, PEDV GI, PEDV GII, and negative samples. The coefficients of variation (CVs) for PEDV positive and negative standard samples were 6.52 % and 14.35 %, respectively, indicating good repeatability of PED-TRFIA. The method achieved a perfect 100 % accuracy in differentiating positive and negative targets from clinical samples. Additionally, by utilizing the paper-based lateral flow immunoassay and a PED-TRFIA reader, the entire PEDV detection process can be completed in the field within 15 min. Therefore, PED-TRFIA can be a promising tool for the diagnosis, prevention, and control of PEDV, particularly suited for field applications. PED-TRFIA directly targets the antigen and employs time-resolved fluorescence microspheres (TRFMs) encapsulating Eu<sup>3+</sup> nanoparticles to significantly amplify the fluorescence signal while effectively suppressing background fluorescence, thereby enhancing its sensitivity and facilitating early detection. Furthermore, this method can rapidly detect both GI and GII mutated genotypes of PEDV through simple operations using low-cost devices in the field.","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infections have a significant impact on the global pig industry. To address the need for on-site detection of PEDV, the paper-based lateral flow immunoassay offers a promising approach, characterized by its simplicity of operation, rapid detection capabilities, and the elimination of expensive instrumentation. However, commonly used signal labels, such as colloidal gold nanoparticles and quantum dots have limitations in sensitivity. To overcome this issue, our study developed a PEDV early on-site detection method based on the Time-Resolved Fluorescence ImmunoAssay (PED-TRFIA), specifically designed to detect PEDV antigens of both the PEDV GI and GII genotypes. PED-TRFIA demonstrated a lower limit of detection (LOD) up to 9.76 × 10<sup>2</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL, which is 64 times higher than that of commercial kits. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent selectivity, as evaluated using various control samples such as PRRSV, PRV, TGEV, PEDV GI, PEDV GII, and negative samples. The coefficients of variation (CVs) for PEDV positive and negative standard samples were 6.52 % and 14.35 %, respectively, indicating good repeatability of PED-TRFIA. The method achieved a perfect 100 % accuracy in differentiating positive and negative targets from clinical samples. Additionally, by utilizing the paper-based lateral flow immunoassay and a PED-TRFIA reader, the entire PEDV detection process can be completed in the field within 15 min.

Plasma membrane Intrinsic Proteins (PIPs) are a crucial subgroup of aquaporins that facilitate water transport across plant cell membrane. However, the role of PIPs under salt stress responses in cotton remains partially unexplored. In this study, we found that the expression level of the aquaporin gene GhPIP2;1 was significantly upregulated under salt stress at three-leaf stage in upland cotton. The overexpression of GhPIP2;1 in Arabidopsis thaliana and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in upland cotton evidenced that GhPIP2;1 positively regulate salt tolerance function. Biochemical analysis including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) content measurements indicated that GhPIP2;1 could enhance stress tolerance by regulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS). The Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and dual luciferase reporter assay confirmed that GhNAC072 specifically binds to the promoter region of GhPIP2;1 and enhance the expression of GhPIP2;1. Phenotypic observations and physiological measurements of GhNAC072 overexpressed Arabidopsis and silenced cotton plants demonstrated that GhNAC072 positively responds to salt stress. The expression level of GhPIP2;1 was significantly decreased in GhNAC072-silenced plants, indicating that GhNAC072 enhances salt tolerance by regulating GhPIP2;1 expression. In summary, this study systematically confirmed that GhPIP2;1 may involve in salt tolerance mechanism in cotton and its expression is regulated by GhNAC072. These results will provide gene resources for salt tolerance and enrich the knowledge on the mechanism of salt tolerance in cotton.","Aquaporins (AQPs) facilitate transmembrane water transport and play a crucial role in plant adaptation to diverse abiotic stress conditions.

System validation demonstrated robust expression of a linearized mVenus cassette, achieving a higher expression level (2-4 folds) than conventional homologous recombination method. Furthermore, high-value carotenoids, such as zeaxanthin and canthaxanthin, were increased by 1.69 and 1.22 folds respectively, with the virus-derived system by expressing bacterial carotenogenic genes.

Our previous, phase 2 clinical trial showed that a 600 mg regimen of onradivir initiated within 48 h of symptom onset can expedite the recovery of adult patients from acute, uncomplicated influenza. Here, we aimed to evaluate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of onradivir in a larger group with acute, uncomplicated influenza. This randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled and oseltamivir-controlled, phase 3 trial was conducted at 68 clinical sites in China. Eligible participants were adults (aged 18-64 years) with an influenza-like illness who screened positive by rapid IAV antigen testing at the first clinical visit, and had a fever (axillary temperature ≥38·0°C) with at least one moderate systemic and one moderate respiratory symptom within 48 h of symptom onset. Patients were randomly assigned into three treatment groups, stratified by influenza symptom scores (≤11 or ≥12), in a 2:1:1 ratio by an interactive web response system, with each treatment lasting 5 days: 600 mg oral onradivir tablets once daily, 75 mg oral oseltamivir phosphate capsules twice daily, or oral placebo. The primary outcome was the efficacy of onradivir versus placebo in the time to alleviation of symptoms (TTAS), from treatment initiation to the remission of influenza symptoms, in the intention-to-treat infection (ITTI) population (ie, all participants who were randomly assigned and tested positive for IAV). The safety endpoints were the frequency and severity of adverse events in all participants who received treatment at least once. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04683406) and is completed. This clinical trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China (EC-2020-080[YW]-02). Between May 12, 2022, and May 16, 2023, 943 patients were screened, of whom 750 met the inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to a group. 48 had negative IAV tests, resulting in an ITTI population of 702 participants (413 [59%] men and 289 [41%] women; mean age 28·1 years [SD 9·7]): 349 in the onradivir group, 177 in the oseltamivir group, and 176 in the placebo group. The baseline viral load (mean 5·15 log<sub>10</sub> copies per mL [SD 1·02]) and the total score of seven influenza symptoms at enrolment were similarly distributed among the groups. The median TTAS in the onradivir group was significantly shorter than that of placebo (38·83 h [95% CI 35·32-41·18] vs 63·35 h [55·48-68·48], difference -24·52 h, p<0·0001, HR 1·53 [95% CI 1·27-1·85]) and similar to that of the oseltamivir group (42·17 h [38·27-52·83], p=0·092, HR 1·12 [0·93-1·35]. Adverse events occurred in 250 (67%) of 373 in the onradivir group, 104 (55%) of 189 in the placebo group, and 89 (47%) of 188 in the oseltamivir group. Although the incidence of diarrhoea was higher in the onradivir group (184 [49%]) than in the placebo (44 [23%]) or oseltamivir (28 [15%]) groups, most incidences were grade 1 or 2, lasted a median of 2 days (IQR 1-3), and resolved without medication. Onradivir has similar curative efficacy to oseltamivir for acute, uncomplicated influenza infections in adult patients, with an acceptable safety profile. At a time when reduced susceptibility to antiviral drugs is a growing concern, this study indicates that onradivir could be an alternative antiviral option or a candidate for use in combination with other antiviral agents for uncomplicated IAV infection.

10.1093/tropej/fmaf024,Evaluation of pregnant women's knowledge about RSV and immunization attitudes before infant immunization with monoclonal antibodies in Turkey.,"RSV is a major health concern for infants. A new long-acting anti-RSV monoclonal antibody has been introduced in some countries. This study aims to assess pregnant women's awareness of RSV and their attitudes toward infant immunization with the anti-RSV monoclonal antibody. A survey on the RSV mAb was conducted with 217 pregnant women, consisting of 28 questions on sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge of RSV infection and the RSV mAb, and attitudes toward giving the mAb to their infant. Pregnant women were specifically surveyed about the use of nirsevimab. Among the participants, 18.5% reported that their child had previously experienced an RSV infection, with 47.6% requiring hospitalization. Willingness expressed by 50.7% to get the RSV mAb, 27.8% were undecided, and 21.6% would not get immunized. The main reason for refusal was lack of information (67.3%). Notably, 58.4% of undecided mothers would consider the RSV mAb if included in the routine immunization schedule. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that ""having previously heard of the RSV mAb"" and ""receipt of other nonroutine vaccines"" were independent factors influencing the consideration of the RSV mAb. A thorough literature review revealed no other studies assessing pregnant women's attitudes toward RSV mAb; it showed they would be more willing to accept it if included in Turkey's national vaccine programs. Further studies are needed globally to find if RSV vaccination rates increase if the benefits of infection protection and detailed information about the RSV vaccine are provided to mothers or families.","RSV is a major health concern for infants.

10.1097/md.0000000000042823,Lemierre syndrome: A case report and literature review on atypical presentation.,"Lemierre syndrome (LS) is a rare but serious condition characterized by septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein (IJV), often secondary to infections in the head and neck region. It typically begins with an oropharyngeal infection, which may or may not be followed by distant septic emboli, most commonly affecting the lungs. The condition is usually caused by members of the normal oropharyngeal flora, with the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium necrophorum being the most prevalent pathogen. Timely diagnosis and antibiotic treatment are essential to prevent adverse outcomes. Clinical circumstances dictate the necessity for therapeutic anticoagulation and surgical intervention. LS can present atypically in terms of the antecedent condition, the etiological agent, the affected vein, and the distant manifestations. Despite the existence of a characteristic clinical presentation, many clinicians remain unaware of this rare condition, which can lead to delayed diagnosis and potentially fatal consequences. A 55-year-old man presented with neck pain and swelling that had persisted for 1 week, following 2 weeks of blunt trauma to the head and neck, which resulted in several superficial abrasions due to his poorly managed epilepsy. Imaging studies revealed thrombosis in the left IJV, accompanied by an abscess that extended into the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Gram staining of the specimen obtained from the neck abscess confirmed the presence of Streptococcus bacteria. The presence of a thrombus in the IJV following blunt trauma to the head and neck, along with a nearby soft tissue abscess, suggests a diagnosis of LS. However, this case is atypical due to the unusual preceding event of blunt trauma and the identification of a rare pathogen, specifically Streptococcus bacteria. The patient received 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone and metronidazole, followed by 2 additional weeks of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate. Additionally, approximately 100 mL of foul-smelling pus was evacuated from the neck region. The patient has achieved a full recovery. A strong clinical suspicion is essential for diagnosing this uncommon syndrome in patients with a history of head and neck conditions who experience IJV thrombosis or metastatic infections.

Hurricane Maria in 2017 devastated Puerto Rico, a major hub for medical supply manufacturing, leading to critical shortages of blood bags and reagents in U.S. hospitals. Rising global temperatures have also challenged the stability of temperature-sensitive reagents and biological samples, with studies indicating that a mere 2°C increase in ambient temperature can significantly reduce enzyme activity in diagnostic assays. Laboratories, particularly in low-resource settings, are struggling to maintain optimal storage conditions, raising concerns about the reliability of test results in disease diagnosis and monitoring. Extreme weather events and shifting disease patterns further compound these challenges. Flooding in South Asia has repeatedly disrupted microbiology laboratories, causing waterborne pathogen contamination and delays in infectious disease testing. In Sub-Saharan Africa, rising temperatures have expanded the range of malaria-carrying mosquitoes, increasing the demand for diagnostic services beyond the capacity of many laboratories. Supply chain disruptions due to climate-related disasters have led to prolonged shortages of essential testing materials, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic when heatwaves affected the production and transportation of medical reagents. These disruptions highlight the urgent need for climate-adaptive strategies to ensure laboratory resilience and continuity in healthcare services. To mitigate these impacts, laboratories must adopt sustainable infrastructure and operational practices. Key recommendations include transitioning to solar-powered refrigeration to prevent sample degradation during power outages, investing in climate-resilient laboratory buildings, and enhancing digital diagnostic capabilities to reduce reliance on physical sample transportation.","Climate change is increasingly disrupting medical laboratory operations worldwide, affecting diagnostic accuracy, infrastructure integrity, and supply chain stability.

10.1289/ehp16607,Wildfire-season Fine Particulate Matter Exposure and Associations with Influenza and Influenza-like-illness Risk in the Western USA.,"Influenza remains a significant public health threat, with pandemic potential. Understanding environmental factors influencing virus spread and severity is critical, particularly as wildfires become more frequent and intense. While temperature and humidity's roles in virus seasonality and persistence are well understood, the impacts of air pollution-especially wildfire-specific particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)-on respiratory infections are less explored. This study aimed to investigate the association between wildfire PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and influenza or influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence. Specifically, we assessed (1) the long-term impact of PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure during the preceding wildfire season on influenza/ILI risk in the following flu season, and (2) the effects of short-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure during the active flu season. We utilized ILI and influenza data from state health departments in six Western U.S. states (Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington) from 2010 to 2019. We applied generalized linear distributed lag models to assess the impact of PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure during the preceding wildfire season on influenza or ILI risk in the subsequent flu season, as well as the effect of short-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure during the current flu season. Long-term exposure to wildfire PM<sub>2.5</sub> was associated with increased influenza risk in states with influenza data: Arizona ([Rate Ratio (RR) =1.061 (1.026-1.100)]), Colorado [RR=1.067 (1.056-1.078)], Montana [RR=1.038 (1.013-1.063)], and Oregon [RR=1.049 (1.041-1.057)], per 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup> PM<sub>2.5</sub> increase. However, the states with only ILI data did not follow this pattern, revealing no observed effect in Nevada [RR=1.005 (0.920-1.097)] and a negative effect in Washington [RR=0.884 (0.842-0.919)]. Similarly, but to a lesser degree, short-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure effects were noted in states with only influenza data, but not ILI data. Our findings underscore a positive association between wildfire-specific PM<sub>2.5</sub> and influenza risk in states with influenza data, suggesting a differential effect of PM<sub>2.5</sub> on respiratory infections. This study supports further investigation into causative mechanisms behind these correlations, particularly considering the increasing frequency of wildfires and the resulting air quality impacts. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP16607.","Influenza remains a significant public health threat, with pandemic potential.

Regulating the interactions of bacteria with various in vivo interfaces can vary microorganism-host relationships, offering a promising approach to intervene immune and/or metabolism disorders. However, the rationale behind the modulation of bacterial interactions with surroundings is poorly understood and methods capable of modifying bacteria to tune the crosstalk with the host have been rarely reported. Recently, considerable attention has been paid to bacterial surface modification, where bacteria can be incorporated with diverse exogenous components. Among different modification strategies, surface conjugation based on covalent chemical linkages has emerged as a key tool to design and introduce functional motifs. Particularly, surface covalent conjugation (SCC) allows for stable attachment of active components to specific sites on bacteria with molecular-level specificity and selectivity, providing a solid foundation for precisely regulating bacterial interactions with in vivo environments.In this Account, we summarize the recent advancements achieved by our research team in regulating the interactions of bacteria with in vivo interfaces at both cellular and tissue levels via covalent conjugation of bacterial surface, aiming to develop alternative insights for disease intervention. First, we utilize the abundant reaction sites on bacterial surface to develop flexible yet versatile covalent modification strategies that do not compromise bacterial viability. Using reactive group-mediated covalent conjugation, such as acylation of amino groups, amidation of carboxyl groups, thiol-Michael addition, or in situ dopamine polymerization, small molecules, macromolecules, and nanoparticles with various functions can be attached onto bacteria. Next, we outline how SCC endows bacteria with additional functions, by combining the inherent properties of bacteria with various synthetic functional payloads. For instance, covalent attachment with specific ligands can strengthen the recognition and binding of bacteria with targeting cells, thereby resulting in enhanced accumulation of bacteria at lesion sites. Moreover, covalent incorporation of components with strong permeability or adhesion properties is able to improve bacterial colonization at tissue surfaces of interest. In addition, functional components with tunable physicochemical properties can be conjugated onto bacteria to remodel the redox microenvironments of lesion sites. Then, we show the benefits of specific interactions of modified bacteria with in vivo environments, including those between bacteria and cells, bacteria and tissues, as well as bacteria and disease microenvironments. We also highlight the importance of regulating bacteria-host interactions in disease intervention, particularly the alleviation of inflammatory bowel disease through oral ingestion, the treatment of tumors via intravenous injection, and the healing of infected wounds by topical administration. Lastly, we discuss the prospects and challenges of using SCC to modify bacteria in terms of regulating bacterial interactions with in vivo environments, especially the potential of translating these modified bacteria from laboratory to clinical practice. We anticipate that the strategy of SCC, along with manipulable interactions between modified bacteria and cell/tissue surfaces proposed in this Account, will promote the development of bacterial engineering methodologies and inspire innovative strategies to modify microorganism-host interface for disease intervention.","ConspectusThe interactions between bacteria and in vivo environments are critical for microorganism-host association, which plays essential roles in host immunomodulation and nutrient metabolism.

10.1073/pnas.2426660122,PARP12-mediated mono-ADP-ribosylation as a checkpoint for necroptosis and apoptosis.,"Necroptosis and apoptosis are two alternatively regulated cell death pathways. Activation of RIPK1 upon engagement of TNFR1 by TNFα may promote necroptosis by interacting with RIPK3 or apoptosis by activating caspases. RIPK1 is extensively regulated by a variety of dynamic posttranslational modifications which control its kinase activity and formation of downstream complexes to mediate necroptosis and apoptosis. Here, we investigate the functional significance and mechanism by which PARP12, a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase, interacts with RIPK1 and RIPK3 in cells stimulated by IFNγ and TNFα. We show that PARP12 catalyzes the mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) of RIPK1 in both the intermediate domain and the kinase domain, as well as the MARylation of RIPK3. PARP12 deficiency reduces necroptosis by inhibiting the activation of RIPK1 kinase and its interaction with RIPK3, as well as sensitizes to apoptosis by promoting the binding of RIPK1 with caspase-8. Thus, upon induction by IFNs, PARP12 may function as a cellular checkpoint that controls RIPK1 to promote necroptosis and inhibit apoptosis. Importantly, while PARP12 is a known interferon-stimulated gene (ISG), PARP12 deficiency promotes the expression of a subset of ISGs and confers protection against influenza A virus-induced mortality in mice. Our study demonstrates that PARP12 is an important modulator of cellular antiviral response.","Necroptosis and apoptosis are two alternatively regulated cell death pathways.

Although pigs are believed to have been independently domesticated in South China, the timing and initial mechanisms of this process remain debated. This study presents a microfossil analysis of pig dental calculus from two early Neolithic sites in the Lower Yangtze River region: Jingtoushan (8,300 to 7,800 cal. BP) and Kuahuqiao (8,200 to 7,000 cal. BP). Analyses of starch, phytolith, and parasite remains indicate that pigs consumed human-associated foods and waste, including cooked starchy plants and human whipworm (<i>Trichuris trichiura</i>) eggs, likely derived from food preparation and fecally contaminated materials. Identified plant taxa include acorns (Fagaceae), rice (<i>Oryza</i> sp.), underground storage organs such as yam (<i>Dioscorea</i> sp.), and wild grasses (Triticeae and Panicoideae), all present in the local botanical assemblages. Coefficients of variation in dental metrics further indicate the coexistence of both domestic and wild populations. Together, these lines of evidence point to multiple modes of human-pig interaction, including early domestic pigs under human management, pigs scavenging near settlements, and free-ranging individuals foraging beyond human influence. Pig domestication in the Lower Yangtze had begun by 8,000 y ago, likely following both commensal and prey pathways, in parallel with the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifeways.

Understanding the detailed mechanism of the immune response to eliminate invasive fungal pathogens may help to provide new insights for the development of antifungal methods and drugs. Previously, we reported that the tyrosine kinase receptor EPH receptor B2 (EPHB2) is a coreceptor of β-glucan and phosphorylates Syk to activate the antifungal downstream signaling pathway. However, how EPHB2 is activated after fungal infection is still unknown. In this study, we show that EPHA5 plays a critical role in antifungal immunity by phosphorylating EPHB2 and Dectin-1 after fungal infection, which facilitates the recruitment and activation of Syk and subsequent activation of downstream antifungal signaling pathways. Additionally, we showed that EphA5-deficient mice exhibited increased susceptibility to Candida albicans infection, with increased fungal burdens and impaired immune cell recruitment. This study provides not only a mechanistic explanation for EPHB2 and Dectin-1 activation after fungal infection but also new insights into potential therapeutic strategies for treating IFIs.","Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) have emerged as a significant health threat and cause approximately 3.75 million deaths per year globally.

Humans can acquire SFV from zoonotic exposures but are not known to be endemically infected and typically exhibit dead-end infections. South American Indian populations (Amerindians) historically have frequent contact with New World monkeys (NWM) and are endemically infected with the retrovirus human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 2 (HTLV-2) originally acquired before populating the Americas. We tested archived serum samples collected from numerous South American Indian persons (n = 1,998) in 1966-1997 from 18 tribes by validated ELISA and Western blot assays containing NWM SFV antigens. We also screened samples for HTLV-2 to compare SFV and HTLV-2 infection. We combined demographic and familial relationship data with the serologic results to evaluate transmission dynamics. We found a high SFV seroprevalence of 9.5% in 15 tribes compared to an HTLV-2 prevalence of 6.1% in 11 tribes. Testing of seropositive samples with Old World SFV antigen showed no reactivity confirming a NWM SFV origin. We found the odds of SFV and HTLV positivity increased with age and documented familial clustering of SFV among spouses and children. Serotyping showed co-circulation of SFV from different NWM species. Our results show that NWM SFV established longstanding prevalence among Amerindians post population of America. The high SFV prevalence will enable studies of disease association and human transmissibility to better understand the public health significance of SFV infections in humans.","Simian foamy viruses (SFV) are retroviruses that widely infect nonhuman primates of New and Old-World origin and exhibit long-standing co-evolution with their hosts.

10.1371/journal.ppat.1012928,SOX9 plays an essential role in myofibroblast driven hepatic granuloma integrity and parenchymal repair during schistosomiasis-induced liver damage.,"Schistosomiasis is a neglected, and potentially lethal, parasitic disease that affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide. As part of the schistosome lifecycle, parasite eggs accumulate within the liver where they evoke intense granulomatous pathology, typified by a dense extracellular matrix (ECM) barrier, which serves to contain toxic egg secretions. In severe cases, this progressive and irreversible egg-evoked ECM deposition can lead to pathological scarring, impaired liver function and lethality. Thus, identifying the core regulators that govern ECM deposition may aid discovery of new therapeutic targets for schistosomiasis. The transcription factor Sex determining region Y-box 9 (Sox9) is a known regulator of pathological scaring. We found that, following Schistosoma mansoni infection, SOX9 was ectopically expressed in myofibroblasts within the granuloma and in surrounding hepatocytes. In the absence of SOX9, granuloma size was significantly diminished, and mice failed to produce a robust ECM barrier around eggs, resulting in more diffuse liver injury and scattered distribution of immune cells. Immunologically, SOX9 loss in both naïve and infected mice led to an increase in hepatic neutrophil and monocyte proportions, with the expansion of Ly6clo monocyte populations in infected SOX9 deficient mice only. Infected SOX9-deficient mice also displayed exaggerated Type 2 inflammation, including pronounced eosinophilia. These data highlight the importance of SOX9 for intact hepatic granuloma formation during schistosomiasis and suggest SOX9 or its related factors may provide attractive future targets for meeting the clinical need to limit and/or reverse fibrotic disease.","Schistosomiasis is a neglected, and potentially lethal, parasitic disease that affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

IAV circulation in domestic animals poses a pandemic risk as it provides new opportunities for zoonotic infections. The recent emergence of H5N1 IAV in cows and subsequent spread over multiple states within the USA, together with reports of spillover infections in humans, cats and mice highlight this issue. The horse is a domestic animal in which an avian-origin IAV lineage has been circulating for >60 years. In 2018/19, a Florida Clade 1 (FC1) virus triggered one of the largest epizootics recorded in the UK, which led to the replacement of the Equine Influenza Virus (EIV) Florida Clade 2 (FC2) lineage that had been circulating in the country since 2003. We integrated geographical, epidemiological, and virus genetic data to determine the virological and ecological factors leading to this epizootic. By combining newly-sequenced EIV complete genomes derived from UK outbreaks with existing genomic and epidemiological information, we reconstructed the nationwide viral spread and analysed the global evolution of EIV. We show that there was a single EIV FC1 introduction from the USA into Europe, and multiple independent virus introductions from Europe to the UK. At the UK level, three English regions (East, West Midlands, and North-West) were the main sources of virus during the epizootic, and the number of affected premises together with the number of horses in the local area were found as key predictors of viral spread within the country. At the global level, phylogeographic analysis evidenced a source-sink model for intercontinental EIV migration, with a source population evolving in the USA and directly or indirectly seeding viral lineages into sink populations in other continents. Our results provide insight on the underlying factors that influence IAV spread in domestic animals.","Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are prime examples of emerging viruses in humans and animals.

10.1371/journal.pntd.0012650,Vertical transmission of Leishmania donovani with placental degeneration in the pregnant mouse model of visceral leishmaniasis.,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a zoonotic disease caused by infection of macrophages by Leishmania donovani or L. infantum, and exhibits symptoms such as fever, anemia, and hepatosplenomegaly. VL during pregnancy has been reported to have negative effects such as miscarriage and vertical infection, but the mechanism is not clear. Here, we aimed to establish a pregnant VL mouse model and elucidate its immunopathology. Female BALB/c mice mated 6 months after L. donovani infection showed reduced pregnancy rates. The fetus was removed by caesarean section on the 18th day of pregnancy, and Leishmania parasite DNA was detected from fetal spleens and livers. As a result, the PCR positive rate was 68.9% (71/103 fetus), and vertical transmission was suspected in 66.7% of infected mothers (12/18 dams). Immunohistochemistry in the fetal livers detected cells positive for the Leishmania antigen, kinetoplastid membrane protein 11 (KMP11). In addition, pathological analysis of the VL placenta revealed trophoblast cell atrophy and vasodilation accompanied by CD3+ cell infiltration in the infected group. On the other hand, few KMP11+ cells were observed in the placenta of the infected group. Furthermore, RNA-Seq analysis revealed that IFN signal activation and cellular immune suppression were induced in the placenta of the infected group. These results suggest that VL in pregnancy induces suppression of placental cellular immunity through IFN and collapse of the placental barrier through trophoblast degeneration, leading to vertical transmission. Because few infected macrophages were observed in the placenta, it is possible that free Leishmania parasites in the blood contribute to transmission across the placenta.","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a zoonotic disease caused by infection of macrophages by Leishmania donovani or L. infantum, and exhibits symptoms such as fever, anemia, and hepatosplenomegaly.

Here, we aimed to establish a pregnant VL mouse model and elucidate its immunopathology. Female BALB/c mice mated 6 months after L. donovani infection showed reduced pregnancy rates. The fetus was removed by caesarean section on the 18th day of pregnancy, and Leishmania parasite DNA was detected from fetal spleens and livers. As a result, the PCR positive rate was 68.9% (71/103 fetus), and vertical transmission was suspected in 66.7% of infected mothers (12/18 dams). Immunohistochemistry in the fetal livers detected cells positive for the Leishmania antigen, kinetoplastid membrane protein 11 (KMP11). In addition, pathological analysis of the VL placenta revealed trophoblast cell atrophy and vasodilation accompanied by CD3+ cell infiltration in the infected group. On the other hand, few KMP11+ cells were observed in the placenta of the infected group. Furthermore, RNA-Seq analysis revealed that IFN signal activation and cellular immune suppression were induced in the placenta of the infected group. These results suggest that VL in pregnancy induces suppression of placental cellular immunity through IFN and collapse of the placental barrier through trophoblast degeneration, leading to vertical transmission. Because few infected macrophages were observed in the placenta, it is possible that free Leishmania parasites in the blood contribute to transmission across the placenta.",PubMed
10.1371/journal.pntd.0013154,Quantitative multi-pathway assessment of exposure to Escherichia coli for infants in Rural Ethiopia.,"In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), enteric infections pose a significant threat to children's health. However, understanding the specifics of when, where, and how young children in LMICs are exposed to enteric pathogens and the roles of animal reservoirs, environmental media, and human hosts play during exposure remains limited. This study systematically evaluates infants' exposure to E. coli through various pathways in the rural Haramaya woreda of Ethiopia. Between June 2021 and June 2022, we conducted over 1300 hours of structured behavioral observations on 79 infants when aged 4-8 months (Timepoint 1) and 11-15 months (Timepoint 2). Enumerators recorded the infant's behavior related to exposure, including when and where it occurred, using a data collection system for behavioral data (Countee). Concurrently, we collected 1338 environmental samples from key contact interfaces between infants, other people, and the environment to test for E. coli. We used a competing hazard model for duration-based behaviors, an inhomogeneous Poisson point process model for frequency-based behaviors, and a left-censored lognormal distribution model for E. coli contamination levels. The behavioral and environmental information was then integrated into an agent-based exposure model framework to quantify the exposure to E. coli through different pathways. The infant behavior, which altered the relative importance of different exposure pathways, changed as children grew older. Notably, we observed increased rates of touching behavior (e.g., touching fomites) and soil-pica, increased consumption of solid food, and more time spent on the bare ground at Timepoint 2. The major sources of exposure to E. coli were food and breastfeeding at Timepoint 1 and food and soil at Timepoint 2. This study provides insights for interventions to minimize infants' risk of exposure to fecal indicator bacteria, E. coli, and subsequent risk of enteric infections, including improved food handling practices, enhanced personal hygiene for breastfeeding caregivers, and education on the risk of soil-pica.","In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), enteric infections pose a significant threat to children's health.

Recent studies indicate that the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) play key roles in this pathological process. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate the effects and mechanisms of MAM-resident FMO2 (flavin-containing monooxygenase 2) in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. We performed bulk RNA-sequencing analysis using heart tissue from patients with cardiac hypertrophy and carried out MAM-targeted mass spectrometry analysis using heart tissue from a mouse model of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. In vitro cell culture using neonatal rat cardiomyocytes was used to study how MAMs formation affected cardiomyocyte functions. By generating different genetic mouse models combined with using adeno-associated virus 9 under the cardiac troponin T promoter techniques, we further investigated and confirmed the effects of MAM structure changes on cardiac hypertrophy. We detected an unexpected component of MAMs structure, which was the FMO2, an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein. FMO2 levels decreased during pathological cardiac hypertrophy. The deletion and overexpression of FMO2 can either worsen or prevent the pathological heart failure progression in vivo, respectively. Our data further demonstrated that FMO2 localizes to MAM structure, where it binds to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate type 2 receptor (IP3R2) as a component of the IP3R2-Grp75 (glucose-regulated protein 75)-VDAC1 (voltage-dependent anion channel protein 1) complex, maintaining endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact and regulating mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling for bioenergetics. Last, we showed that a synthetic peptide-enhancing endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact promoted Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer and prevented pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Our findings reveal a key role of FMO2 in myocardial hypertrophy and that FMO2 plays a pivotal role in maintaining MAM structure and function, which may represent a novel mechanism and therapeutic target for cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.","Cardiac hypertrophy, as an important pathological change, contributes to heart failure.

The CD4+ T cell activities including interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production that account for this protection are poorly understood. Using intravenous antibody labeling and lineage-tracing reporter mice, we show that monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), rather than phenotypically similar monocytes or dendritic cells, are preferentially infected with Mtb in murine lungs. MDMs were recruited to the lungs by Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells via IFN-γ, which promoted the extravasation of monocyte precursors from the blood. It was possible that CD4+ T cells recruited infectable MDMs because these cells are uniquely poised to receive cognate MHCII-mediated help to control intracellular bacteria. Mice with MHCII deficiency in monocyte-derived cells had normal Mtb-specific CD4+ T cell activation, expansion and differentiation but the CD4+ T cells were unable to attenuate Mtb growth. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we showed that MDMs receiving cognate MHCII-mediated help from CD4+ T cells upregulated glycolytic genes associated with Mtb control. Overall, the results indicate that CD4+ T cells recruit infectable MDMs to the lungs and then trigger glycolysis-dependent bacterial control in the MDMs by engaging their MHCII-bound Mtb peptides. Moreover, the results suggest that cognate MHCII-mediated help to promote MDM glycolysis is an essential, IFN-γ-independent effector function of Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells.","Although lung myeloid cells provide an intracellular niche for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), CD4+ T cells limit Mtb growth in these cells to protect the host.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013110,Variance in C. elegans gut bacterial load suggests complex host-microbe dynamics.,"Variation in bacterial composition inside a host is a result of complex dynamics of microbial community assembly, but little is known about these dynamics. To deconstruct the factors that contribute to this variation, we used a combination of experimental and modeling approaches. We found that demographic stochasticity and stationary heterogeneity in the host carrying capacity or bacterial growth rate are insufficient to explain quantitatively the variation observed in our empirical data. Instead, we found that the data can be understood if the host-bacteria system can be viewed as stochastically switching between high and low growth rates phenotypes. This suggests the dynamics significantly more complex than logistic growth used in canonical models of microbiome assembly. We develop mathematical models of this process that can explain various aspects of our data. We highlight the limitations of snapshot data in describing variation in host-associated communities and the importance of using time-series data along with mathematical models to understand microbial dynamics within a host.","Variation in bacterial composition inside a host is a result of complex dynamics of microbial community assembly, but little is known about these dynamics.

10.1371/journal.pone.0323970,Variant evolution graph: Can we infer how SARS-CoV-2 variants are evolving?,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has undergone extensive mutations over time, resulting in considerable genetic diversity among circulating strains. This diversity directly affects important viral characteristics, such as transmissibility and disease severity. During a viral outbreak, the rapid mutation rate produces a large cloud of variants, referred to as a viral quasispecies. However, many variants are lost due to the bottleneck of transmission and survival. Advances in next-generation sequencing have enabled continuous and cost-effective monitoring of viral genomes, but constructing reliable phylogenetic trees from the vast collection of sequences in GISAID (the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) presents significant challenges. We introduce a novel graph-based framework inspired by quasispecies theory, the Variant Evolution Graph (VEG), to model viral evolution. Unlike traditional phylogenetic trees, VEG accommodates multiple ancestors for each variant and maps all possible evolutionary pathways. The strongly connected subgraphs in the VEG reveal critical evolutionary patterns, including recombination events, mutation hotspots, and intra-host viral evolution, providing deeper insights into viral adaptation and spread. We also derive the Disease Transmission Network (DTN) from the VEG, which supports the inference of transmission pathways and super-spreaders among hosts. We have applied our method to genomic data sets from five arbitrarily selected countries - Somalia, Bhutan, Hungary, Iran, and Nepal. Our study compares three methods for computing mutational distances to build the VEG, sourmash, pyani, and edit distance, with the phylogenetic approach using Maximum Likelihood (ML). Among these, ML is the most computationally intensive, requiring multiple sequence alignment and probabilistic inference, making it the slowest. In contrast, sourmash is the fastest, followed by the edit distance approach, while pyani takes more time due to its BLAST-based computations. This comparison highlights the computational efficiency of VEG, making it a scalable alternative for analyzing large viral data sets.","The SARS-CoV-2 virus has undergone extensive mutations over time, resulting in considerable genetic diversity among circulating strains.

Whilst these tools are being evaluated and implemented in the general population, there is the need to focus on special populations such as individuals with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) who have altered red blood cell morphology and atypical immune responses, which can obscure parasite detection. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of one of such tools, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) malaria screener app in people living with sickle cell disease in a malaria-endemic country, Ghana. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among SCD patients attending the Sickle Cell Clinic at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana. Following informed consent, whole blood samples were collected and analyzed using the NLM malaria screener app, conventional microscopy, RDT, and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), with PCR as the reference standard. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of each diagnostic method were compared against PCR results. The NLM app identified the highest number of positive malaria cases, with 110 positive cases (36.2%), while both RDT and microscopy reported the highest number of negatives, with 287 negative cases (94.4%). Compared to PCR, the NLM app demonstrated a sensitivity of 89.5% and a specificity of 67.4%. RDT and microscopy displayed the same sensitivity as the NLM app, each achieving 89.5%. However, while RDT and microscopy had a specificity of 100%, the NLM app had a considerably lower specificity of 67.4%.The NLM malaria screener app shows promise as a preliminary screening tool for malaria in individuals with SCD. However, its lower specificity indicates a need for confirmatory testing to avoid potential overdiagnosis and mismanagement.

Reduced susceptibility to permethrin in Culex pipiens, an important vector for West Nile virus, has been reported across the US based on a standardized laboratory method: the CDC bottle bioassay. This bioassay uses a rapid phenotypic outcome to reveal evidence for IR, but how this translates to the effectiveness of formulated products used in an operational setting is unclear. Therefore, other methods for IR monitoring are recommended to quantify IR or evaluate formulated products against field populations in real-world conditions. To compare some of the available methods, we collected populations of Cx. pipiens from six sites in the Northwest Mosquito Abatement District (Cook Co., Illinois), and used a susceptible laboratory strain of Cx. pipiens as a control, to test for IR to pyrethroids using CDC bottle bioassays, caged field trials, and topical applications. CDC bottle bioassays suggested that Cx. pipiens from this area exhibit IR to both etofenprox and Sumithrin®. Caged field trials with ultra-low volume Anvil® 10 + 10 (Sumithrin®) demonstrated resistance to the product and underscored the need for inclusion of a susceptible control to differentiate IR from inadequate product distribution. Topical applications revealed low to high levels of resistance to synergized and unsynergized pyrethroids (etofenprox, Sumithrin®, and deltamethrin) in all field populations.

This study examines the uptake of RSV prophylaxis in neonates born in a U.S. military healthcare setting, focusing on maternal and infant demographic factors and the impact of universal healthcare access. A retrospective analysis was conducted on neonates born between October 16, 2023, and March 31, 2024, at a military treatment facility. Inclusion criteria encompassed neonates admitted to the mother-baby unit or neonatal intensive care unit, excluding those who died or were transferred before discharge. Demographic data were collected, and RSV prophylaxis rates were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-squared tests, with a significance threshold of P < .05. Among 571 eligible neonates, 455 (80%) received adequate RSV prophylaxis, defined as either maternal RSVPreF administration or neonatal nirsevimab by discharge. Uptake was higher among infants of active duty/reserve/guard mothers (84%) compared to dependents/retirees (77%; P = .047). No significant differences were observed based on maternal race or rank (P = .89 and P = .45, respectively). Of the 116 infants lacking prophylaxis at discharge, 7 (6%) received nirsevimab as outpatients within 2-3 weeks postpartum, emphasizing this period as critical for intervention. This study highlights the high uptake of RSV prophylaxis within a universal healthcare model and identifies the possibility of maternal service member status as a factor influencing uptake. The results suggest that the first month of life is a pivotal period for addressing gaps in RSV prophylaxis coverage. Although race did not significantly affect uptake, ongoing research is needed to explore barriers and refine strategies to optimize prevention efforts, particularly among dependent and retired populations. These findings underscore the role of universal health care in mitigating disparities and improving neonatal health outcomes.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis, including maternal RSVPreF vaccination and infant-administered nirsevimab, was introduced in 2023 to mitigate severe RSV outcomes in neonates.

Among 571 eligible neonates, 455 (80%) received adequate RSV prophylaxis, defined as either maternal RSVPreF administration or neonatal nirsevimab by discharge. Uptake was higher among infants of active duty/reserve/guard mothers (84%) compared to dependents/retirees (77%; P = .047). No significant differences were observed based on maternal race or rank (P = .89 and P = .45, respectively). Of the 116 infants lacking prophylaxis at discharge, 7 (6%) received nirsevimab as outpatients within 2-3 weeks postpartum, emphasizing this period as critical for intervention. This study highlights the high uptake of RSV prophylaxis within a universal healthcare model and identifies the possibility of maternal service member status as a factor influencing uptake. The results suggest that the first month of life is a pivotal period for addressing gaps in RSV prophylaxis coverage. Although race did not significantly affect uptake, ongoing research is needed to explore barriers and refine strategies to optimize prevention efforts, particularly among dependent and retired populations. These findings underscore the role of universal health care in mitigating disparities and improving neonatal health outcomes.",PubMed
10.1089/bfm.2025.0062,Viable Spore-Forming Obligate Anaerobes Are Rare in Pasteurized Donor Human Milk: A Pilot Study.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> When access to mother's own milk is limited, pasteurized donor human milk (PDHM) is the best alternative source of nutrition for high-risk preterm infants. Microbial screening of PDHM is essential to ensure its safety, as spore-forming bacteria may survive pasteurization. Standard screening will detect spore-forming bacteria that grow aerobically, such as <i>Bacillus cereus,</i> but may miss obligate anaerobes, such as <i>Clostridium</i> species. Although milk banking guidelines globally recommend microbial screening of milk batches, they do not specifically recommend anaerobic testing. This study aimed to determine the proportion of PDHM batches containing viable anaerobic bacteria after pasteurization. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> In this prospective cohort study, 150 batches of PDHM from unique donors were sampled (August-December 2024) at Australian Red Cross Lifeblood and tested at an accredited food safety laboratory. Prepasteurization samples were tested for aerobic bacteria, and postpasteurization samples were tested for both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria using a validated method (detection limit ≤1 CFU/mL). <b><i>Results:</i></b> No bacteria were recovered from any of the 150 postpasteurization samples tested using an anaerobic culture method. Using standard aerobic culture, 4.7% (7/150) of samples failed prepasteurization microbial screening according to local acceptance guidelines, due to a total colony count ≥ 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL (<i>n</i> = 6) and/or the presence of Enterobacteriaceae ≥ 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL (<i>n</i> = 3), and none failed postpasteurization testing. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> This study confirmed that obligate anaerobic bacteria are rarely cultured from PDHM. Additional process control through routine testing for anaerobes in PDHM is therefore not considered essential, particularly when PDHM is stored frozen (<18°C) after pasteurization. Clinicians should maintain vigilance for potential recipient adverse events and promptly report these to the source milk bank.","<b><i>Background:</i></b> When access to mother's own milk is limited, pasteurized donor human milk (PDHM) is the best alternative source of nutrition for high-risk preterm infants.

They help to provide nucleotides essential for bacterial growth by degrading host nucleic acids, are involved in the degradation of extracellular traps and hence in immune evasion, and can have direct cytotoxic activity in host cells. Nuclease expression in bacteria of the Mycoplasma genus has been poorly studied so far. In this study, a standardized set of methods was used to detect the in vitro nuclease activities of major animal mycoplasmas. Nucleases were detected in swine (Mycoplasma (M.) hyopneumoniae, M. hyorhinis and M. flocculare) as well as avian (M. gallisepticum, M. iowae and M. synoviae) species, but not in the small ruminant subspecies M. mycoides subsp. capri and M. capricolum subsp. capricolum. In swine species, nuclease activity was detected in both the cell pellet and the supernatant, whereas in poultry species, the results were more variable. We showed that detection of nuclease activity -in terms of presence/absence in our experimental conditions- was strain dependent in M. iowae and M. synoviae. The DNA from macrophage extracellular traps was further demonstrated to be a substrate for mycoplasma-expressed nucleases, suggesting that several Mycoplasma species and/or strains infecting animals could feed on resulting nucleotides and hence escape the traps, two features contributing to persistence of the infection.","Secreted nucleases, either cell-attached or released in the environment, play varied roles in bacteria-hosts interactions during an infection.

The aim of the study was to identify a reliable PCR detection target for Y. enterocolitica biotype 1A (BT 1A), which may cause human infections. Esculin hydrolysis (attributed to the production of ß-glucosidase) is a recognised differential biochemical reaction for the identification of YE BT 1A compared with other YE biotypes. A multiplex PCR should be developed allowing the detection of all YE biotypes in food. The prevalence of seven genes (gluA to gluG) attributed to ß-glucosidase production was assessed by in silico analysis. Specific primers for gluF of BT 1A were designed. The specificity and sensitivity of the singleplex PCR was determined. A multiplex PCR system with primers for ail, ystA and ystB was developed. The PCR was tested with various Yersinia species isolated in Germany and New Zealand as well as with minced pork artificially inoculated with two different YE isolates. This study identified gluF in more than 99% (n = 248) BT 1A isolates, but not in other YE biotypes. This gene was used as target for PCR and included in a multiplex PCR successfully tested with various Yersinia strains as well as with minced pork containing 10 cfu/25 g of a BT 4 and a BT 1A isolate.

10.1002/adhm.202501142,A Smart Hydrogel Dressing Balances Reactive Oxygen Species Levels for Effective Treatment of Bacteria-Infected Atopic Dermatitis.,"Bacteria-infected atopic dermatitis (AD) is an infectious inflammatory skin disease that profoundly disrupts patients' daily lives. As a viable alternative to antibiotic therapy, reactive oxygen species (ROS) treatment has emerged, effectively eradicating bacteria without the risk of antibiotic resistance. Nevertheless, the excess production of ROS can subsequently trigger inflammation in surrounding healthy tissues. To tackle this challenge, a ROS-balancing hydrogel dressing is devised. This dressing integrates a nanocomposite comprising zinc-doped ferricyanide-derived metal-organic framework (ZnMOF) loaded with curcumin (Cur), embedded in a hydrogel matrix of gelatin (Gel) crosslinked with silk fibroin (SF). Upon light activation, the Cur/ZnMOF/SF@Gel hydrogel dressing generates a significant quantity of ROS, enabling rapid bacterial elimination at the infection site. Concurrently, the enzymatic antioxidant activity of ZnMOF and the polyphenolic compounds in Cur within the hydrogel work in synergy to neutralize excess ROS by chelating iron ions, thereby inhibiting the Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions. This mechanism restores ROS balance and mitigates oxidative stress in the skin tissues. Additionally, the synthesized hydrogel dressing demonstrates remarkable self-healing properties, robust adhesive capabilities, and outstanding mechanical performance. This intelligent, multifunctional hydrogel offers a promising substitute for traditional antibiotic-loaded surgical dressings in the rapid and effective management of bacteria-infected AD.","Bacteria-infected atopic dermatitis (AD) is an infectious inflammatory skin disease that profoundly disrupts patients' daily lives.

However, as our understanding of viruses has advanced - especially with the increasing availability of genomic sequences - the arguments for these alternative formats (such as that viruses were not living or that they evolved too quickly) have diminished.

This enabled the independent generation of each dilution factor under constant pressure. Furthermore, an integrated asymmetric micromixer effectively mixed two liquids under laminar flow conditions, enabling simultaneous dispensing of the mixed solution at uniform concentrations into five microchambers for each dilution factor. Additionally, a permanent stop valve in the outlet of each microchamber prevented leakages, minimizing the waste of valuable samples and reagents. We demonstrate that diluted samples were accurately prepared at the intended logarithmic dilution factors in a single operation using purified cannabis seed DNA, achieving detection sensitivity similar to that of conventional turbidity-based LAMP assays.

Targeting these steps for the development of new antiviral strategies requires methods that enable investigating virus-membrane interactions under in-situ conditions, while providing mechanistic insights on a molecular level. Here, we demonstrate the use of surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy combined with tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs) for the label-free detection of virus-membrane interactions, using the Influenza A/X-31 virus (IAV) as a model. Exploiting the nanometer-scale surface-sensitivity of SEIRA, we detect the vibrational fingerprint of IAV's hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein, as it specifically binds to sialic acid receptors of the ganglioside GD1a in the tBLM, mimicking the host membrane. Triggering viral fusion via a pH change, we identify structural changes of HA engaging with the host membrane model. Moreover, by constructing the tBLM from deuterated lipids, we utilize the vibrational isotope effect and distinguish between viral and model membrane, providing a basis to track lipid mixing. This approach establishes a powerful tool for spectroscopic studies of the function and inhibition of viral proteins, while still embedded in intact virus particles.","Viral binding and membrane fusion are essential steps in viral infection, mediated by viral proteins that bind to host cell receptors and facilitate the fusion between viral and host membranes.

In addition, a separate cohort consisting of 10 IT, 13 IA, and 15 HC individuals was recruited for experimental validation. The liver tissue of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) exhibited enriched atypical B-cell (ABC) and FCRL1<sup>+</sup> B-cell subsets compared to their peripheral blood. Specifically, the ABC subset was enriched in the liver tissue of the IT patients and specifically overexpressed immune-tolerance-related genes, such as TNFRSF1B, ADGRE5, ZBTB32, and GRN. Conversely, the FCRL1<sup>+</sup> B-cell subset was enriched in the liver tissue of the IA patients and characterized by a high expression of immune-activation-related genes, including TNFRSF13C, LY9, FCRL1, CD55, and NFKB1. Similarly, the distribution patterns of ABC and FCRL1⁺ B cells in IT and IA patients were also confirmed in peripheral blood through parallel analyses and flow cytometry validation. Additionally, the CHB patients demonstrated abnormal plasma cell (PC) differentiation compared with the CR patients. For instance, the IT patients exhibited a low expression of SEC61A1 in their plasma cells (PCs), while the IA patients demonstrated a reduced expression of TNFRSF17; both molecules are critical to the maturation and functional activity of antibody-secreting cells.

For instance, the IT patients exhibited a low expression of SEC61A1 in their plasma cells (PCs), while the IA patients demonstrated a reduced expression of TNFRSF17; both molecules are critical to the maturation and functional activity of antibody-secreting cells. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the composition and functional characteristics of B-cell subsets in HBV-infected individuals at various clinical phases. It also identifies the potential mechanism responsible for humoral immunity in cases of HBV infection.",PubMed

Imbalance of gut microbiota (GM) homeostasis affects the development and progression of CVD. Exercise can remodel GM and improve GM disorders in CVD patients. By combing the research progress of GM-mediated exercise intervention for CVD, it was found that 1) Streptococcus, Lactococcus, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Turicibacter are pathogenic bacteria in CVD patients; 2) Response to exercise to modulate the microbiota of CVD includes increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Faecalobacteria, and Roseburia, decreasing the proportion of Streptococcus, Enterobacter, and other pathogenic bacteria, and regulating metabolite-producing bacteria such as Prevotella and Ruminococcus; 3) Exercise can improve the CVD process via GM, by remodeling physiological mechanisms such as vascular function, cardiac function, autonomic function and hemodynamics, and molecular mechanisms such as regulation of DNA methylation, histone modification, non-coding RNAs; 4) Most of the existing studies have focused on aerobic exercise. The specific mechanisms, individualized intervention programs and long-term effects of different types of exercise on GM in CVD patients need to be further explored.","Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are major lethal diseases worldwide.

It causes chronic infections, especially in hospital settings, and is a significant contributor to nosocomial infections. Its capacity to create biofilms resistant to antibiotics is the reason for its infamous persistence in clinical settings. P. aeruginosa infections can affect any area of the body because the bacteria's biofilm enables it to stick to any surface, living or non-living. One of the primary clinical challenges in treating P. aeruginosa biofilm is its noteworthy resistance to many classes of antibiotics. The bacterium's ability to acquire resistance through efflux pumps, beta-lactamase production, and genetic mutations complicates treatment options. Recently, multidrug- resistant (MDR) strains of P. aeruginosa are becoming increasingly prevalent, limiting the efficacy of traditional antibiotics and leading to the need for alternative therapies. There is an ongoing need for novel treatment options, including bacteriophage therapy, antimicrobial peptides, and vaccines. The rapid adaptability of P. aeruginosa and its ability to develop resistance underscores the importance of continued research into new therapeutic strategies. This review discusses the various therapeutic strategies like; antimicrobial therapy, targeting efflux pumps and biofilms of P. aeruginosa, phage therapy, immunotherapy and nanotechnology to explore the mechanisms, through which antimicrobial compounds interact with biofilm structures and the bacteria within.","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative clinical pathogen, particularly affecting immunocompromised patients, those with cystic fibrosis, and burn victims.

However, little is known about differences in parasite communities between geographically and genetically distinct populations of the same host species. American kestrels (Falco sparverius) are small falcons with regionally distinct genetic populations across North America. We sampled kestrels from Delaware and Utah for avian haemosporidian parasites (genera: Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, and Leucocytozoon) and used molecular barcoding of the parasite cytochrome b gene (cyt b) to quantify parasite genetic lineage diversity. We identified four lineages of Haemoproteus parasites and one Leucocytozoon lineage infecting kestrels. A comparison with previous studies suggests that most of these lineages are largely restricted to kestrels. We found similar infection prevalence and lineage composition between the sites. All kestrels sampled in Utah were adults (i.e., sampled after hatch year), but in Delaware, we found adult birds had a higher infection prevalence than juveniles (i.e., hatch-year birds). Despite harboring largely the same parasite lineages, kestrels are unlikely to disperse between Utah and Delaware. The similarity in parasite lineages in the two kestrel populations could be due to a number of factors including broadly distributed vector species (of which little is known), movement of alternative and undetected host species, or transmission during migration or on overwintering grounds. Alternatively, the cyt b gene might not capture recent genetic differentiation among the parasites. Future studies should explore these various possibilities to understand the mechanisms underpinning parasite distributions across genetically structured host populations.","Parasite communities vary among host species and across space.

Since the gut microbiota plays a critical role in immunological response, metabolic control, and digestion, it is critical to comprehend how circadian misalignment impacts gut microbial equilibrium. This review examines research from the last ten years to assess the effects of circadian rhythm disturbances and meal time variations on the composition of the gut microbiota, the integrity of the gut barrier, and metabolic consequences. Using search terms like ""Chrononutrition AND Gut health,"" ""Circadian Rhythm AND Meal timing,"" and similar combinations, 31 peer-reviewed publications from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus were included. There is evidence that circadian misalignment, which can be brought on by shift work, irregular eating habits, or social jet lag, affects lipid metabolism, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis, and gut microbial rhythms. According to research, microbial diversity and function are enhanced by early-time-restricted feeding (eTRF), which synchronizes with circadian cycles. Changes in tight junction proteins have been linked to irregular meal timing, which increases intestinal permeability and inflammation. Additionally, new research indicates a bidirectional relationship in which the gut bacteria might affect the central and peripheral circadian clocks. Chrononutrition is a promising non-pharmacological approach to preventing metabolic dysregulation and promoting gut health. Consistently timing meals, especially early-time-restricted feeding, can help maintain microbial balance, improve gut barrier function, and lower the risk of chronic diseases by bringing food intake into alignment with circadian cycles. The need for integrated approaches to food and lifestyle changes in future research and clinical practice is highlighted by the bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiota and circadian systems.","This review explores the relationship between circadian rhythms and meal timing, or chrononutrition, and how it affects gut health.

It is clinically characterized by progressive motor impairments, including rigidity, bradykinesia, tremors, and gait disturbances. The neuropathological hallmark of PD is the aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) into Lewy bodies (LB) and neurites (LN). Although α-syn plays essential physiological roles, its misfolding and accumulation drive neurodegeneration. In this study, we investigated the temporal progression and anatomical distribution of α-syn pathology using a bilateral adeno-associated virus serotype-9 (AAV9)-mediated α-syn overexpression model in rats. Disease-related features were analyzed at one, two and four months post-injection. Neuronal α-syn overexpression was confirmed as it co-localized predominantly with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons, distinctly separate from glial markers. Behavioral assessment, immunofluorescence assays, stereological quantification, and optical densitometry revealed progressive motor impairments, dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), and decreased TH + fibers in the striatum and dendrites of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr). These changes were accompanied by increased microglial activation. Furthermore, axonal swellings in the striatum increased progressively over time, correlating with reductions in striatal TH optical density. By characterizing the temporal dynamics of α-syn-induced pathology, this study underscores the model's relevance for PD research and highlights critical time windows for evaluating therapeutic interventions.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 1-5% of individuals over 60, with a higher incidence in men.

While gentamicin is a clinically effective antibiotic, it has significant oto- and nephrotoxicity. In human subjects, repeated exposure to gentamicin results in dizziness, tinnitus, and high frequency hearing loss. Gentamicin has similar effects across animal species and through several different routes of delivery, including injection and direct deposits in the tympanic cavity. Gentamicin can also be administered intranasally to treat sinusitis in humans and this route of delivery is believed to minimize toxic effects. Nonetheless, we hypothesized that intranasal irrigation of gentamicin will result in ototoxicity and impaired auditory and vestibular function similar to systemic delivery. We investigated this hypothesis in Sprague-Dawley rats that received bilateral, intranasal irrigations of a therapeutic dose of gentamicin or saline from postnatal day (P) 21-31. We examined vestibular structure and function in control and gentamicin-exposed rats by assessing performance on a series of sensorimotor tasks, recording vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs), and examining number and morphology of neurons in the brainstem vestibular nuclei. Gentamicin-exposed animals had significantly worse performance on sensorimotor tasks, significantly slower VEMPs, and significantly fewer neurons in the vestibular nuclei. Together, our findings indicate that intranasal administration of gentamicin results in impaired auditory and vestibular function consistent with other routes of delivery.","Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that broadly targets Gram-negative bacteria.

We analyzed the phylogeny of different virus families to investigate virus evolution and found that the most diverse tick-associated viruses belonged to the family Siphoviridae, which diverged earlier in evolutionary time than other arboviruses. There were only a few tick-specific viruses, whereas the number of vertebrate-infecting viruses in ticks was greater.

This retrospective study analyzed patients who underwent treatment at the Department of Burns and Wound Repair Surgery of Zibo Central Hospital between January 2018 and November 2022 with the intention of preserving the titanium mesh. The treatment protocol involved initial wound bed management, including debridement of necrotic tissue and eradication of bacteria, followed by the augmentation of dermal thickness using a dermal pad to maintain the integrity of the titanium mesh. Eight patients, consisting of 6 males and 2 females with a mean age of 47.5 ± 17.5 years (range, 30-65), were included in the study. The exposed area of the mesh varied from 0.3 × 1 to 2 × 3.0 cm, with the thinning scalp area around the exposed titanium mesh ranging from 1.6 × 1.8 to 2 × 2.5 cm. The hospital stay duration ranged from 21 to 40 days, with all 8 patients achieving primary wound healing. No signs of recurrence were observed during the 6 to 18 months of follow-up, and cranial CT scans showed no abnormalities. In conclusion, the utilization of dermal skin grafts to cover exposed titanium mesh after cranioplasty may facilitate the preservation of the titanium mesh.","This study seeks to explore the efficacy of utilizing dermal skin pieces as a potential alternative to mesh removal in cases of titanium mesh exposure after cranioplasty, with the goal of preserving the benefits of the rigid prosthesis.

Many hospitals teach this skill with the commercial CAE Blue Phantom gelatinous training blocks. However, their cost is a barrier. This has led to experimentation with creative alternatives. Recent studies have trialed SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast) in the production of training models for medical procedures. SCOBY is a biofilm-like structure appearing as a thick, rubbery film. We aimed to develop a 2-vessel SCOBY-based model and compare its effectiveness for teaching USIV against the Phantom. Participants, 23 emergency medicine clinicians, performed USIV on each model and completed a pre- and post-procedure questionnaire. Seventy-four percent of participants indicated that the SCOBY model more closely resembled the clinical reality of human tissue compared with 13% for the Phantom. SCOBY provided an improved visual appearance, physical touch, feel of the procedure, and appearance of ""subdermal tissues"" on ultrasound compared to the Phantom. These results suggest a promising future for SCOBY as a cost-effective alternative to teaching clinical skills.","Ultrasound-guided intravenous (USIV) cannulation is a common alternative when IV access cannot otherwise be obtained.

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has enabled fine-grained studies of virus evolution in the human population. Serial passaging <i>in vitro</i> offers a complementary controlled environment to investigate the emergence and persistence of genetic variants that may confer selective advantage. In this study, nine virus lineages, including four ""variants of concern"" and three former ""variants under investigation,"" were sampled over ≥33 serial passages (range 33-100) in Vero E6 cells. WGS was used to examine virus evolutionary dynamics and identify key mutations with implications for fitness and/or transmissibility. Viruses accumulated mutations regularly during serial passaging. Many low-frequency variants were lost, but others became fixed, suggesting either <i>in vitro</i> benefits or at least a lack of deleterious effect. Mutations arose convergently both across passage lines and when compared with contemporaneous SARS-CoV-2 clinical sequences. These mutations included some that are hypothesized to drive lineage success through host immune evasion (e.g., S:A67V, S:H655Y). The appearance of these mutations <i>in vitro</i> suggested key mutations can arise convergently even in the absence of a multicellular host immune response through mechanisms other than immune-driven mutation.

10.1128/spectrum.03223-24,Impact of antibiotics on membrane vesicle production in Group B <i>Streptococcus</i>.,"Group B <i>Streptococcus</i> (GBS) is an important bacterial pathogen during pregnancy, colonizing up to 35% of pregnant people recto-vaginally. Intrauterine GBS infection during pregnancy can cause preterm labor, early membrane rupture, and, if the fetus gets infected, stillbirth or early-onset disease (EOD) following birth. Intrapartum antibiotics are recommended to treat GBS-colonized pregnant patients during labor to prevent these outcomes, particularly EOD. However, persistent GBS colonization has been observed despite antibiotic treatment. One strategy employed by bacteria to promote survival and antibiotic tolerance is the production of membrane vesicles (MVs). To understand how GBS MVs are affected by antibiotics and influence bacterial survival, we exposed a clinical GBS strain recovered from a pregnant patient with persistent colonization to antibiotics and examined the impact on MV production and composition. Using nanoparticle tracking analysis, microscopy, and proteomics, antibiotic treatment of GBS was found to significantly increase the production of MVs relative to untreated GBS (control) regardless of the antibiotic class (ampicillin; <i>P</i> = 4.2 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, erythromycin; <i>P</i> = 0.01). Moreover, antibiotic exposure yielded MVs with different protein composition compared to the untreated control, with 21 and 19 proteins unique to the ampicillin- and erythromycin-treated GBS, respectively. Increased abundance of antibiotic-specific protein targets was observed in the respective antibiotic-treated MVs, suggesting a mechanism for evading antibiotic-mediated killing. Together, these data suggest that antibiotic treatment alters both the production and composition of MVs, which can promote GBS survival in such conditions.IMPORTANCEGBS colonization during pregnancy can lead to invasive disease in neonates. Although antibiotics are given to GBS-positive pregnant patients during labor, some of these individuals remain colonized with GBS after treatment. Persistent GBS colonization is a public health concern, threatening the effectiveness of antibiotics and increasing the risk of GBS disease, especially for subsequent pregnancies. Although mechanisms linked to persistent colonization and antibiotic tolerance are poorly understood in GBS, MV production has been shown to promote bacterial survival in other species with and without antibiotic exposure. Herein, we demonstrated that two different antibiotics trigger changes in the production and composition of MVs in a persistent GBS colonizing strain, providing insight into the mechanisms used by GBS to rebound following antibiotic prophylaxis. Knowledge gained from this study can guide efforts in the development of more targeted and effective treatments for GBS disease.","Group B <i>Streptococcus</i> (GBS) is an important bacterial pathogen during pregnancy, colonizing up to 35% of pregnant people recto-vaginally.

Patients reporting persistent common warts and/or a combination of molluscum contagiosum or more than 2 flat warts, with a clinical assessment of severe or persistent skin infection, met the clinical severity criteria for inclusion. Resistance to several therapies was also considered. A total of 632 patient records were analysed to clinically characterize the warts, laboratory data, treatments used and their responses, comorbidities, and family history. Among these, 459 cases were initially excluded from further evaluation. A questionnaire was provided by phone to 173 patients, among whom 47 patients were selected for an in-person consultation. Of these, 6 met the criteria for further evaluation. Immunological tests revealed neutropenia, low levels of immunoglobulin isotypes (IgA, IgM, and IgG), and reduced frequency of lymphocyte subsets. Family history, flat warts, and associated recurrent viral infections suggested the need for further immunological evaluation.

Diarrhea attributed to Cryptosporidium (cryptosporidiosis) decreased from a peak of 0.19 episodes per child at 1-2 years to 0.05 episodes per child at 3-4 years of age (P = .0064). Notably, the decrease in cryptosporidiosis was not accompanied by a decline in subclinical infections. Using an episode-based analysis confirmed that the parasite burden declined with repeated infections (P < .0001 from the mixed-effects model included data from all infection frequencies; Cq value of the first and fourth infections (last reinfection with >10 cases): Cq 28.65 ± 5.533 versus 32.42 ± 4.046).

10.1128/msphere.00999-24,A dynamic barrier: remodeling of the nuclear envelope during closed mitosis in malaria parasites.,"<i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, the protozoan parasite responsible for the most severe form of human malaria, replicates through an unconventional mode of closed mitosis, where the nuclear envelope (NE) remains intact across multiple asynchronous nuclear divisions. This Full Circle minireview illustrates how a decade-long journey-from early electron microscopy observations of nuclear pore dynamics-has evolved into a broader investigation of NE composition, architecture, and regulation across the parasite life cycle. Advances in imaging, including ultrastructure expansion microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, revealed key features such as the bipartite microtubule organizing center, nuclear pore complex rosettes, and specialized NE scaffolds. Structure-guided and proteomic approaches identified divergent SUN-domain proteins, <i>Pf</i>SUN1 and <i>Pf</i>SUN2, as essential for NE integrity, genome stability, and chromatin positioning during schizogony. Hi-C analyses further uncovered species- and stage-specific chromatin organization, linking peripheral heterochromatin clustering to virulence gene regulation and life cycle progression. Despite lacking lamins, <i>Plasmodium</i>'s NE functions as a dynamic architectural hub that bridges chromatin, spindle microtubules, and organelle inheritance.

This Full Circle minireview illustrates how a decade-long journey-from early electron microscopy observations of nuclear pore dynamics-has evolved into a broader investigation of NE composition, architecture, and regulation across the parasite life cycle. Advances in imaging, including ultrastructure expansion microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, revealed key features such as the bipartite microtubule organizing center, nuclear pore complex rosettes, and specialized NE scaffolds. Structure-guided and proteomic approaches identified divergent SUN-domain proteins, <i>Pf</i>SUN1 and <i>Pf</i>SUN2, as essential for NE integrity, genome stability, and chromatin positioning during schizogony. Hi-C analyses further uncovered species- and stage-specific chromatin organization, linking peripheral heterochromatin clustering to virulence gene regulation and life cycle progression. Despite lacking lamins, <i>Plasmodium</i>'s NE functions as a dynamic architectural hub that bridges chromatin, spindle microtubules, and organelle inheritance.

Molecular characterization revealed high-risk clades, with ST<sup>pas</sup>2 as the most prevalent, followed by the emerging ST<sup>pas</sup>164 and ST<sup>pas</sup>16 clones, which showed significant resistance and virulence potential. CRAB prevalence among ICU patients and the emergence of highly resistant clones show the need for surveillance and alternative therapeutic options. The presence of cefiderocol resistance and the high rate of sulbactam-durlobactam non-susceptibility in CRAB isolates without prior exposure raise concerns about the spread of resistance in asymptomatic carriers. AST should be performed before using novel antibiotic agents.IMPORTANCECarbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB) is a highly drug-resistant bacterium that poses a serious threat in hospitals, especially to patients in intensive care units (ICUs). This study examined CRAB bacteria found in ICU patients in Vietnam, focusing on their resistance to antibiotics, including new antibiotics such as cefiderocol and sulbactam-durlobactam. The results showed that CRAB in Vietnam is resistant to almost all the antibiotics tested, making infections extremely difficult to treat. Alarmingly, some bacteria were resistant to cefiderocol and sulbactam-durlobactam even in patients who had never received these drugs, suggesting that resistance is spreading quietly. This highlights the urgent need for ongoing surveillance, early detection, and careful use of antibiotics to prevent the spread of untreatable infections.",PubMed

The role of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) in CAG progression has not been explored, presenting a critical knowledge gap in understanding <i>H. pylori</i>-induced CAG pathogenesis. Sprague-Dawley rats and gastric epithelial cell line were infected with H. pylori to build CAG model. The mRNA and protein levels of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), MTTP, and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blotting, respectively. Moreover, the localization of DNMT1 and MTTP was detected via immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the pathological changes of gastric tissue were analyzed by HE staining. The MTTP expression was downregulated in CAG. Moreover, overexpression of MTTP in gastric epithelial cells could suppress the inflammatory response induced by <i>H. pylori</i> infection and ferroptosis by upregulating GPX4 expression. In addition, DNMT1 expression was upregulated in CAG and was negatively correlated with MTTP expression. Furthermore, DNMT1 could target MTTP promoter to activate methylation and downregulate MTTP expression. DNMT1 downregulated the MTTP expression through methylation, and thus mediate inflammasome-ferroptosis processes via GPX4 in the <i>H. pylori</i>-induced CAG.","<i>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)</i>-induced chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is a significant health concern.

Phytohormones, amino acids and proteins have been suggested as compound types involved in gall formation, and a few specific effectors have been proposed as candidate effector molecules, however no specific effector molecules have been identified. Hence, in this study, we identified the cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 proteins (CAP) peptide from horned gall aphid Schlechtendalia chinensis transcripts through in silico screening and the Arabidopsis-based gall-forming assay (Ab-GALFA), a bioassay system for analysing the molecular mechanisms of gall formation. Furthermore, we successfully generated the insect gall-like structure in Veronica peregrina-the host plant of the gall-forming weevil Gymnaetron miyoshii Miyoshi-without insect parasitism, using three minimal effector elements: the CAP peptide, auxin, and cytokinin. Given the similarity of the gall structure to the native gall, both in gene expression profile and morphology, we experimentally demonstrated that it was artificially generated using effector molecules, the CAP peptide, auxin, and cytokinin.","The formation of galls by gall-inducing insects on their host plants demonstrates the concept of 'extended phenotype,' referring to traits expressed in a host organism manipulated by a parasite.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 fathers (mean age = 44.2, SD = 8.2) from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras (91.3% foreign-born, average U.S. residency = 18.1 years). About 70% were married or living with a partner, and nearly half (47.8%) had less than a high school education. Most had one child aged 11-17, with 70% of children born in the U.S. Findings revealed gaps in fathers' knowledge about HPV, its cancer-preventive benefits, and vaccine safety concerns. Cultural factors and gendered views on vaccination were prevalent. Around 33% of fathers reported that their children received an HPV vaccine recommendation, and all initiated vaccination. Fathers preferred receiving vaccine information from healthcare providers, highlighting their critical role in decision-making. Findings highlight the need for culturally tailored health promotion strategies aimed at Central American immigrant fathers. Public health campaigns should directly address vaccine safety concerns, incorporate cultural values, and emphasise the importance of informed decision-making, and engage healthcare providers to boost HPV vaccine uptake and reduce vaccine hesitancy in this population.","This qualitative study examined factors influencing Central American fathers' views and behaviours on the HPV vaccine for their 11-17-year-old children, aiming to identify barriers and facilitators to vaccination in this underrepresented group.

Identification of risk factors for IA occurrence and provision of targeted preventive and therapeutic measures are crucial for clinical diagnosis of IA. Dental caries is a common oral disease that affects the global population. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential connection between dental caries and the incidence of IA. We conducted a single-center retrospective 1:1 matched case-control study to assess the correlation between dental caries and the occurrence of IA among 230 participants. Participants were categorized into IA and non-IA groups. All participants underwent cerebral digital subtraction angiography or magnetic resonance angiography, as well as oral assessment. Using binary logistic regression analyses, we examined whether presence of dental caries was correlated with the occurrence of IA. Compared with the non-IA group, the IA group exhibited a greater prevalence of dental caries (90.44% vs. 56.52%) and a greater prevalence of history of root canal treatment (73.91% vs. 48.70%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a significance between the presence of dental caries (OR: 4.14, 95% CI: 1.35-12.66) and IA occurrence. Also, the history of root canal treatment (OR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.09-3.79) were significantly associated with IA occurrence (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). Dental caries was significantly associated with the incidence of IA. Cariogenic bacteria may enter the systemic circulation through pulp, potentially leading to pathological changes in normal cerebral blood vessels, such as the development of IA.","The prevalence of intracranial aneurysm (IA) in the population is approximately 3-7%, with a rupture mortality rate as high as 40%.

10.1101/2025.03.03.641134,Role of IL10 signaling in the circadian control of host response to Influenza infection.,"We have previously demonstrated that the circadian clock regulates the host response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection, conferring a time-of-day-specific protection -infection at dawn resulted in a threefold increase in survival and reduced immunopathology compared to infection at dusk. While IL10 is well-known for its immunoregulatory function, its role in IAV remains unclear, with studies reporting both protective and detrimental effects. Given the diurnal rhythmicity of IL-10 receptor ( <i>Il10ra</i> ) expression in the lung, we investigated the contribution of IL-10 signaling to time-of-day-specific IAV protection. We found that blocking IL10 signaling abrogated the time of day protection, leading to increased immunopathology characterized by enhanced lymphocyte infiltration and global immune activation (transcriptomic analysis). Interestingly, while later, IL-10R blockade also eliminated the time-of-day difference in IAV outcomes, it improved the outcome of dusk-infected mice. Furthermore, natural killer (NK) cell depletion suppressed IL-10 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage, suggesting a role for NK cells in regulating IL-10 signaling. In conclusion, incorporating the circadian context has not only clarified the IL-10 role in IAV infection but also underscored the pivotal influence of circadian regulation on immune responses.","We have previously demonstrated that the circadian clock regulates the host response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection, conferring a time-of-day-specific protection -infection at dawn resulted in a threefold increase in survival and reduced immunopathology compared to infection at dusk.

10.1021/acsomega.4c11412,Evaluation of the Antimicrobial and Organic Dye Removal Properties of Silver-Incorporated ZIF‑L Metal-Organic Framework Nanoparticles.,"Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is a serious problem encountered all over the world. With the misuse of antimicrobial agents for the treatment of human and animal diseases, large quantities of these agents find their way into our environment, polluting water and soil. Further, with industrialization and urbanization, several organic dyes are used as colorants for products. The waste products from such manufacturing processes find their way into our environment, especially in the less developed world. There is an urgent need to remediate the effects of organic dyes and develop a new class of materials that can tackle the effects of antimicrobial resistance. In this regard, the research in this paper pertains to the development of zinc imidazolate metal-organic framework (ZIF-L) nanoparticles and evaluation of their antimicrobial effects on both standard and clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). Further, in this work, we evaluated the removal of organic dyes using ZIF-L and Ag/ZIF-L nanoparticles. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, and band-gap energy analysis. The results for the antibacterial study showed that Ag/ZIF-L nanoparticles were superior to ZIF-L against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa strains tested, where the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of Ag/ZIF-L was 2.5 mg/mL, whereas the MBC of ZIF-L was more than 10 mg/mL. In the case of E. coli strains, ZIF/L showed a better MBC value of less than 1.25 mg/mL, whereas for Ag/ZIF-L it was more than 1.25 mg/mL. Further, Ag/ZIF-L nanoparticles coated on a face mask and cotton gauze demonstrated superior antimicrobial activity compared to uncoated gauze and mask, whereas the Ag/ZIF-L-coated mask and gauze showed the zone of inhibition (ZOI) for all of the bacteria with P. aeruginosa having a higher ZOI value than S. aureus and E. coli. For quantification of the removal of organic dyes, ZIF-L and Ag/ZIF-L nanoparticles showed complete methylene blue dye removal from the solution at 150 min in the presence of sunlight. Under dark conditions, only 83% dye was removed by Ag/ZIF-L and 65% by ZIF-L. The results show that ZIF-L metal-organic frameworks have the potential to be used for clinical and environmental remediation applications.","Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is a serious problem encountered all over the world.

Remarkably, amiodarone enhanced ravuconazole efficacy as combination chemotherapy was more effective than monotherapy in downregulating parasite load and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, attenuating cardiac damage in all experimental models. These findings demonstrate a positive in vivo interaction between ravuconazole and amiodarone against T. cruzi infection. Furthermore, they highlight the relevance of the host genetic background and parasite strain on treatment outcomes.",PubMed

However, while all structural prediction tools tested showed cathelicidin-BG to be helical, there were mixed results for cathelicidin-DM, with most predicting it to contain three antiparallel β-sheets and no helices. Also, separate researchers, in nonidentical conditions, reported cathelicidin-BG to possess antimicrobial activity against only Gram-positive bacteria, unlike cathelicidin-DM, which affected both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, suggesting more dissimilarities between the peptides. We therefore decided to experimentally verify and compare the structures and activities of the peptides. Until now, there is no experimentally determined structural information on either peptide, and no cheap, efficient procedure has been reported for their mass production. We hereby report a recombinant method for cathelicidin-DM and cathelicidin-BG overexpression and purification, which yielded 1.19 and 1.92 mg of pure peptides, respectively, per 0.5 L of Luria-Bertani culture. At all oxidation states, both peptides adopted a random coil structure in sodium phosphate buffer (SPB) at pH 7.4, but switched to a helical conformation in membrane mimetics. In SPB, both native peptides demonstrated strong activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with ≤5 μM of each peptide killing all cells of the tested bacterial strains, through membrane disruption as one of the possible mechanisms. We therefore conclude that, under the conditions studied, both cathelicidins have comparable structures and antimicrobial activities as their sequence homology suggested; and we recommend the use of laboratory experimentations for validation of structural prediction results.","Cathelicidin-DM and cathelicidin-BG are homologous and are expected to be similar in structure and biological activity.

We demonstrated the prospective application of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in the diagnosis of a mixed fungal infection. In this study, we compared the performance of chest radiography, galactomannan (sGM), and beta-d-glucan (sBDG) serology with a novel diagnostic method based on creatinine-indexed microbial siderophores in urine. A woman with angioblastic T-cell lymphoma presented with neutropenia following allogeneic transplantation. sGM and sBDG remained positive throughout the 28-day intensive care unit stay. A. fumigatus DNA was detected in the induced sputum samples on sampling days 0 and 18. On day 18, a CT scan showed a typical nest sign, and R. microsporus DNA was detected in sputum. The patient was discharged from the hospital on day 28 and expired 7 days later. With our novel strategy based on mass spectrometry, A. fumigatus was consistently detected in the urine from day 0 to the end of the stay by the detection of triacetylfusarinine C (uTafC), an A. fumigatus-specific hydroxamate siderophore. An additional invasive R. microsporus infection was revealed by the detection of a mucoromycete-specific carboxylate siderophore in urine, rhizoferrin (uRhf), from day seven onward. Both creatinine-normalized siderophore indices (uTafC/Cr, uRhf/Cr) were sensitive to antifungal therapy and correlated with fast relapses of the invasive disease in time. This study illustrates how such an early and specific new approach can unravel the complexities of dual fungal infections.","Advances in the early diagnosis of systemic mycoses are urgently needed, given the morbidity and mortality of such infections and the correlation between delays in treatment and poor outcomes.

This is crucial when phages are <i>i)</i> exposed to sunlight (e.g., in agriculture) or <i>ii</i>) are to be used simultaneously with UV for sterilization. Here, we develop a method utilizing a food dye, brilliant blue FCF (BB), that selectively stabilizes bacteriophages against exposure to UV irradiation. In the absence of BB, all tested phages and bacteria are completely inactivated by UV exposure. However, with the addition of BB, all tested non-enveloped phages are effectively protected, while gram-negative bacteria remain vulnerable to UV inactivation. The mechanism of protection requires selective binding of BB to the virion. The simultaneous action of BB-stabilized bacteriophages and UV allows for the removal of up to 99.99 % of bacteria within only 30-60 min. We demonstrate the method's applicability in combating biofouling of membranes and food sterilization.

We addressed these challenges using state-of-the-art single-cell genome technology (SAG-gel) combined with extensive metagenomic datasets targeting the bacterial and viral communities in Lake Biwa. From two water layers and two seasons, we obtained 862 single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs), including 176 viral (double-stranded DNA phage) contigs, which identified novel virus-host pairs involving dominant freshwater lineages. The viral infection rate, estimated by mapping the individual SAG's raw reads to viral contigs, showed little variation among samples (12.1%-18.1%) but significant variation in host taxonomy (4.2%-65.3%), with copiotrophs showing higher values than oligotrophs. The high infection rates of copiotrophs were attributed to collective infection by diverse viruses, suggesting weak density-dependent virus-host selection, presumably due to their nonpersistent interactions with viruses resulting from fluctuating abundance. In contrast, the low infection rates of oligotrophs supported the idea that their codominance with viruses is achieved by genomic microdiversification, which diversifies the virus-host specificity, sustained by their large population size and persistent density-dependent fluctuating selection. Notably, we discovered viruses infecting CL500-11, the dominant bacterioplankton lineage in deep freshwater lakes worldwide. These viruses showed extremely high read coverages in cellular and virion metagenomes but were detected in <1% of host cells, suggesting a low infection rate and high burst size.

Natural enemies are also key factors affecting the diversification of victim populations. Co-dispersal of enemies may induce local diversity loss at diversity cold spots as enemies from diversity hots pots are often more efficient in predation. Here, we experimentally tested this hypothesis using a model microbial system: <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> and its lytic phage. The ancestral bacterium diversified at three resource levels across eight temperature gradients in the presence and absence of phages. Bacteria diversified into more morphotypes at higher temperatures and higher resource levels when phages are absent, and dispersal increased population local diversity at low-diversity habitats. The presence of phages removed the differences in morphological diversity among different temperatures or resource levels. In addition, the co-dispersal of enemies caused higher morphotype loss at lower-quality habitats where the local bacteria are of lower resistance. The simultaneous dispersal of enemies and victims may have crucial consequences for population persistence in edge habitats.","Dispersal between heterogenous habitats is a major determinant of population diversification, and may often introduce new morphotypes in habitats where population diversity is low.

10.1093/evlett/qraf003,Landscape structure as a driver of eco-evolution in host-parasite systems.,"Spatial network structure of biological systems drives ecology and evolution by distributing organisms and their genes. The ubiquitous host-parasite systems are no exception. However, past theoretical work has largely focused on simple spatial structures, such as grids, hampering the translation of theoretical predictions to real ecosystems. Thus, we develop an eco-evolutionary metapopulation model of host-parasite dynamics where hosts and parasites disperse through realistically complex spatial networks representing major biomes using river-like and terrestrial-like networks. We generate the testable prediction that parasite virulence, or how parasites harm their hosts, peaks at intermediate dispersal values in river-like systems while it increases with increasing dispersal in terrestrial-like systems. In river-like systems, virulence also reaches higher overall values. Moreover, we show that kin selection is the main driver of virulence evolution. Spatial networks generate characteristic patterns of parasite relatedness which drive differential virulence evolution. Finally, we show that accounting for virulence evolution allows us to predict the distribution of key epidemiological variables (e.g., parasite extinction risks) within spatial networks. Our study highlights how eco-evolutionary feedbacks can be understood in light of spatial network structure by linking network topology to classical evolutionary mechanisms such as kin selection.","Spatial network structure of biological systems drives ecology and evolution by distributing organisms and their genes.

However, past theoretical work has largely focused on simple spatial structures, such as grids, hampering the translation of theoretical predictions to real ecosystems. Thus, we develop an eco-evolutionary metapopulation model of host-parasite dynamics where hosts and parasites disperse through realistically complex spatial networks representing major biomes using river-like and terrestrial-like networks. We generate the testable prediction that parasite virulence, or how parasites harm their hosts, peaks at intermediate dispersal values in river-like systems while it increases with increasing dispersal in terrestrial-like systems. In river-like systems, virulence also reaches higher overall values. Moreover, we show that kin selection is the main driver of virulence evolution. Spatial networks generate characteristic patterns of parasite relatedness which drive differential virulence evolution. Finally, we show that accounting for virulence evolution allows us to predict the distribution of key epidemiological variables (e.g., parasite extinction risks) within spatial networks. Our study highlights how eco-evolutionary feedbacks can be understood in light of spatial network structure by linking network topology to classical evolutionary mechanisms such as kin selection.",PubMed

This report describes the case of an immunocompetent man who developed cardiac tamponade due to a paradoxical response during TB treatment. No pericardial effusion was observed at the time of diagnosis. However, he developed cardiac tamponade 35 days after the initiation of anti-TB drugs. He was treated with emergency pericardial drainage and systemic corticosteroid therapy, after which his hemodynamic status improved. Although there was no recurrence of the increased pericardial effusion, the patient died from a central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection. Cardiac tamponade caused by a paradoxical response is extremely rare in a patient without human immunodeficiency virus infection. Even if there are no findings of tuberculous pericarditis at the time of diagnosis, the possibility of a paradoxical response should be considered in a patient who subsequently develops cardiac tamponade.","Tuberculous pericarditis is a serious extrapulmonary complication of tuberculosis (TB) that is difficult to diagnose and can lead to cardiac tamponade.

Options for mitigating these potential trade-offs depend on the management context. For example, in the sea louse-salmon system, managers use discrete treatment applications to control louse burdens, applying treatment when parasite burdens exceed a target threshold. To analyze the effect of a threshold-based control of disease treatment on economic, conservation, and evolutionary outcomes, we incorporate discrete treatment into a dynamical model of sea louse-salmon systems with disease spillover to wild populations. The model follows both salmon hosts and sea lice through domestic, wild, and migratory populations, with treatment occurring when sea lice exceed a target threshold. Our model shows that simultaneous economic and conservation win-wins are possible: there are treatment threshold choices that lead to relatively high wild juvenile salmon population sizes and relatively low economic losses, especially when treatment is very effective or treatment is cheap. However, positive evolutionary outcomes are harder to capture and occur most often when treatment efficacy is low and the treatment threshold is either near zero or very high. Expanding the management toolbox beyond choices of treatment threshold and treatment efficacy could help managers better capture positive economic, evolutionary and conservation outcomes in the system.","Mitigating negative downstream impacts of parasitic disease in aquaculture settings entails tradeoffs: reducing parasite loads has economic and conservation benefits, but treatment is often expensive and frequent treatment can lead to resistance evolution.

To understand the factors and interactions that influence preventive behavior, we conducted a cross-sectional exploratory study. Participants (<i>n</i> = 1,111) were students from Heilongjiang Province. A survey questionnaire was distributed through online social platforms. The questionnaire collected data on sociodemographic variables, perception of infection risk (PIR), perceived benefits of preventive behavior (PBPB), perceived disorders of preventive behavior (PDPB), attitudes of preventive behavior (APB), and behavior of wearing condoms (BWC). BWC did not differ significantly according to gender, academic qualification pursued, or subject major (<i>p</i> ≥ 0.05), but did differ significantly based on sexual orientation, receiving HIV infection prevention education, and commercial and casual sexual behaviors. No significant correlation was detected between PIR and APB (<i>p</i> ≥ 0.05), while PBPB and APB were significantly positively and PDPB and APB significantly negatively correlated (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Further, there was no significant correlation between PBPB and BWC (<i>p</i> ≥ 0.05), while PIR and APB were positively correlated with BWC (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and there was a negative correlation between PDPB and BWC (<i>p</i> < 0.05). APB did not mediate between PDPB and BWC, but APB partially mediated between PDPB and BWC, accounting for approximately 9.96% of the total effect value, and played a fully mediating role (100%) between PBPB and BWC. Our analysis indicates that PBPB acts on BWC through APB, PIR directly affects BWC, and PDPB can directly affect BWC, while also influencing BWC through APB. Future efforts to increase PBPB, PIR, and APB, reduce PDPB, and promote the use of condoms in sexual behavior among college students are warranted.","Although the global human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection rate has decreased in recent years, the proportion and number of HIV-infected individuals aged 18-24 years has increased.

10.3389/fpubh.2025.1580863,Update on the global burden of acute viral hepatitis in 2021: addressing health inequalities.,"The strategy for eliminating viral hepatitis is at a critical juncture, necessitating an updated assessment of global incidence trends. Data on the incidence of four types of acute viral hepatitis (AVH), namely, acute hepatitis A (AHA), acute hepatitis B (AHB), acute hepatitis C (AHC), and acute hepatitis E (AHE), were sourced from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2021. The annual percentage change is utilized to elucidate temporal trends, whereas health inequalities and frontier analysis serve to evaluate global health equity and quantify disparities in burden among countries. In 2021, the estimated global incidence for AVH was as follows: AHA (160.86 million), AHB (63.53 million), AHE (19.37 million), and AHC (7.01 million). From 2000 to 2021, the age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) for four types of AVH demonstrated a declining trend, with AHB showing the most significant decrease. It is anticipated that the incidence rates for AHA, AHB, and AHC will continue to decline over the next 15 years; however, the incidence rate of AHE is projected to increase. In 2021, the incidence of AVH displayed a significant negative correlation with the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI), but health disparities between countries have diminished. Countries with the highest potential for elimination of AHB are primarily situated in low and low-middle SDI regions, whereas those for AHA are concentrated in high and high-middle SDI regions. Furthermore, countries with the largest disparities in AHC and AHE were dispersed. Although global incidence of AVH is decreasing, it remains a serious public health challenge. Reducing health disparities is crucial for the elimination of viral hepatitis.","The strategy for eliminating viral hepatitis is at a critical juncture, necessitating an updated assessment of global incidence trends.

They are often resistant to conventional treatments and may cause cosmetic and psychological distress. Immunotherapy is a promising alternative that stimulates the host immune system to clear the virus and the infected cells. This study compared the efficacy and safety of two immunotherapeutic agents, intralesional measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and intralesional vitamin D, in the treatment of common warts. This was a single-blind randomised controlled trial conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Kolkata, India. Patients aged 12 years or older with common warts were randomly assigned to receive either intralesional MMR vaccine or intralesional vitamin D every 3 weeks for a maximum of three doses or until complete resolution, whichever was earlier. The primary outcome was the reduction in the size of the largest wart. Secondary outcomes included patients' and physicians' global assessment, complete response rate, adverse effects, and recurrence rate. A total of 36 patients were enrolled and analysed. Both MMR and vitamin D groups showed a significant reduction in the size of the largest wart throughout the treatment period (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of size reduction, patients' and physicians' global assessment and adverse effects. The complete response rate was higher in the MMR group (64.7%) than in the vitamin D group (36.8%); however, the difference was not statistically significant (<i>P</i> = 0.14). The recurrence rate was low in both groups (5.9% in the MMR group and 10.5% in the vitamin D group). Both intralesional MMR vaccine and intralesional vitamin D are effective and safe immunotherapeutic options for the treatment of common warts. MMR vaccine may have a slight advantage over vitamin D in terms of complete response rate; however, further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-ups are needed to confirm this finding.","Common warts are benign skin lesions caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.

Establishing an HEK293 cell-based array of genetically dissected sialoglycan assemblies enabled screening of the complete interaction cascade from binding to infection, at physiologically relevant low virus doses. Screening forty years of H3N2 receptor binding evolution showed that besides N-glycans, deemed as principal receptors for primary attachment, specific O-glycans or glycosphingolipids independently supported all steps from primary binding to entry. For all three glycoconjugate classes, receptor preferences gradually evolved toward utilization of human-type α2-6-linked sialic acid receptors, followed by regaining use of avian-type α2-3-linked receptors after 1995. The screen identified a lack of quantitative correlation between binding and infection efficiency, suggesting specific receptor requirements beyond attachment. Virus-glycan interactions and other sialoglycan-dependent interactions with cells can be functionally analyzed using this system.","Influenza A viruses multivalently engages sialoglycan attachment factors.

Primary infection causes self-limiting febrile illness, but secondary infection by a heterologous serotype can predispose to severe dengue. Neutralizing antibodies are key mediators of long-term protection; however, cross-reactive, non-neutralizing antibodies can cause antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, which contributes to severe dengue. Therefore, elicitation of a potent, broadly neutralizing antibody response against all four DENV serotypes is desired for vaccine design.

For this purpose, we quantified the genetic structure and differentiation of host-related populations of a common polyxenic avian ectoparasite <i>Ornithomya avicularia</i> (Hippoboscidae, Ornithomyinae), a louse fly species parasitizing various bird species occupying diverse ecological niches.

Despite the ecological and phylogenetic differences among hosts, the genetic differentiation among louse fly populations was modest, indicating ongoing gene flow. Bayesian clustering and discriminant analysis identified two genetic clusters with relatively weak barriers to gene flow, but this clustering reflected neither phylogenetic nor ecological differences between hosts. We suggest that the high dispersal abilities and the specific reproductive strategy of <i>O. avicularia</i> likely contribute to the genetic homogeneity of its populations across ecologically and phylogenetically distant hosts.

The marbled murrelet (<i>Brachyramphus marmoratus</i>) is an unusual seabird that forages in the ocean but uses trees in old growth and late successional forests for nesting. Populations have declined in some areas due to both changing ocean conditions and reduction in breeding habitat, making it important to consider the impacts of other factors, such as parasites and pathogens, on murrelet health and reproduction. In this study we describe a novel blood parasite (<i>Leucocytozoon marmoratus</i> sp. nov.<i>)</i> found in a murrelet population on the Oregon coast, USA and quantify its prevalence and burden in 374 individuals along the Oregon coast over a 6-year period. Genetic sequencing revealed that the species of <i>Leucocytozoon</i> we identified has a mitochondrial lineage most closely related to a <i>Leucocytozoon</i> found in yellow-eyed penguins (<i>Megadyptes antipodes</i>) of New Zealand. The prevalence of <i>Leucocytozoon</i> in murrelets was 62 % (233/374) and within an infected individual the mean burden of parasitism was 7.1 parasites/100 white blood cells, with substantial variation between individuals (from 1 to 113 parasites/100 white blood cells). Both parasite prevalence and burden varied across years and were higher in years of poorer ocean conditions suggesting that birds experiencing poor conditions may have had reduced ability to fight infection. Male murrelets had significantly lower parasite burdens than females, which may be due to energetic constraints of egg production in breeding females. Importantly, murrelets that did not attempt a nest were associated with higher parasite burdens at the time of capture, perhaps due to correlations between parasitism and systemic health.","Parasitism is a known cause of morbidity and mortality in wildlife species and may exacerbate population declines in species threatened by changing landscapes.

The new infectious virus known as Yezo virus, which is spread by tick bites, produces a condition marked by fever and a decrease in leucocytes and blood platelets. We suggest a multiepitope vaccination design that makes use of immunoinformatics technologies to combat this new danger. Sequences from Yezo virus proteins were gathered, and they allowed us to identify T-cell and linear B-cell epitopes. The vaccine design showed good physical and chemical characteristics as well as allergenicity and antigenicity. Simulations of molecular docking revealed robust contact with toll-like receptor 4. The HDOCK server generated the docking scores for protein interactions i.e. -295.74 kcal/mol for the epitopes in combined form: -281.98 kcal/mol by the epitopes obtained from nucleoprotein, and epitopes obtained from the glycoprotein shows - 262.67 kcal/mol in response to TLR4. The dynamic analysis of vaccine binding with these receptors was conducted with regards to interaction energetics and complex stability. Results showed that vaccine construct was stable throughout the simulation time intervals with strong hydrogen bonds interactions with TLR4 receptor residues. Lastly, we hypothesize that the vaccination sequence described here has a great chance of eliciting particular and protective immune responses, pending assessment of further experimental investigation.","Globally, tickborne orthonairoviruses are regarded as a danger to public health.

10.2147/jir.s518155,N4BP3 Activates TLR4-NF-κB Pathway in Inflammatory Bowel Disease by Promoting K48-Linked IκBα Ubiquitination.,"N4BP3 is a ubiquitination-related gene that plays a pivotal role in neurology and neoplasia. Studies have demonstrated its essential function in axonal and dendritic branching, promoting hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer. Our previous research reveals that N4BP3 enhances inflammatory responses by modulating the NOD2 signaling pathway. It is crucial to investigate whether N4BP3 regulates inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through the TLR4 signaling pathway and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were used to activate the TLR4 pathway in THP-1/Caco-2 cells. THP-1/Caco-2 cells were transfected with either N4BP3 overexpression or knockdown plasmids, generating N4BP3-overexpressing or N4BP3-deficient cell lines. For in vivo studies, colitis was induced in mice using dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Additionally, negative control and N4BP3-knockdown C57BL/6 mouse models were established via intraperitoneal injection of control or N4BP3-targeting adeno-associated virus (AAV). LPS stimulation significantly upregulated N4BP3 expression in THP-1/Caco-2 cells compared to sterile water treatment (P < 0.05). In N4BP3-overexpressing cells, LPS induction led to significantly higher expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA, as well as phospho-NF-κB p65 protein, compared to wild-type THP-1/Caco-2 cells (P < 0.05). Conversely, these inflammatory markers were markedly downregulated in N4BP3-knockdown THP-1 cells following LPS stimulation (P < 0.05). In DSS-induced colitis models, N4BP3-knockdown mice showed decreased phospho-NF-κB p65 but increased IκBα protein expression in colonic tissues compared to DSS-treated control mice (P < 0.05). Furthermore, we observed interaction between N4BP3 and IκBα, with N4BP3-overexpressing THP-1 cells demonstrating significantly elevated K48-linked ubiquitination levels versus controls. LPS upregulates N4BP3 expression, which subsequently enhances K48-linked ubiquitination of IκBα, leading to NF-κB pathway activation, and exacerbating IBD progression. These findings suggest N4BP3 as a potential therapeutic target for developing novel IBD treatments.","N4BP3 is a ubiquitination-related gene that plays a pivotal role in neurology and neoplasia. Studies have demonstrated its essential function in axonal and dendritic branching, promoting hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer. Our previous research reveals that N4BP3 enhances inflammatory responses by modulating the NOD2 signaling pathway. It is crucial to investigate whether N4BP3 regulates inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through the TLR4 signaling pathway and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were used to activate the TLR4 pathway in THP-1/Caco-2 cells. THP-1/Caco-2 cells were transfected with either N4BP3 overexpression or knockdown plasmids, generating N4BP3-overexpressing or N4BP3-deficient cell lines. For in vivo studies, colitis was induced in mice using dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Additionally, negative control and N4BP3-knockdown C57BL/6 mouse models were established via intraperitoneal injection of control or N4BP3-targeting adeno-associated virus (AAV). LPS stimulation significantly upregulated N4BP3 expression in THP-1/Caco-2 cells compared to sterile water treatment (P < 0.05). In N4BP3-overexpressing cells, LPS induction led to significantly higher expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA, as well as phospho-NF-κB p65 protein, compared to wild-type THP-1/Caco-2 cells (P < 0.05).

Of the 2 conditions, UC is more prevalent, and there is a positive correlation between bacterial dysbiosis and colitis severity and incidence. Therefore, we hypothesize that mice that are genetically predisposed to colitis when colonized with colitic associated bacteria will exhibit an early onset of colitis biomarkers. Four sets of germ-free interleukin-10 -/- mice were gavaged orally with pooled fecal samples from 2 healthy individuals or an individual with severe colitis or healthy mice or dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mice. The disease activity index was used to rank colitis severity weekly in transplanted mice for eight weeks. There were significant differences in alpha (Shannon Index) and beta diversity (Bray-Curtis) between healthy and colitic-associated microbiota recipients, indicating dysbiosis (human fecal microbial transplantation <i>P</i> = 8.09∗10<sup>-6</sup>, <i>P</i> = .001); (Mice fecal microbiota transplant <i>P</i> = .0197, <i>P</i> = .025). Despite the lack of colitis development, UC-associated microbiota recipients had reduced mucus thickness and increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the distal colon compared to healthy-associated microbiota recipients. However, DSS-induced colitis associated microbiota recipients did not show an increase in colitis biomarkers compared to healthy associated microbiota recipients. This study demonstrates that UC-associated bacterial dysbiosis induces colonic inflammation and mucus thinning, biomarkers of early colitis onset, in interleukin-10 -/- mice compared to mice with healthy human associated bacteria.Colitis induction depends on bacterial community stability as DSS-induced colitis associated microbiota recipients did not show an increase in colitis or colitis biomarkers in the absence of DSS.","Inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), are inflammatory gastrointestinal conditions in which the pathogenesis is influenced by immune dysfunction, genetics, and environmental factors.

Current dressings fail to simultaneously block bacterial invasion and manage internal wound infection, necessitating innovative solutions. This study introduces PINSHIELD, a dual-functional dressing that externally seals wounds while efficiently managing exudate to mitigate pin-site infections (PSI). The external shell provides a physical barrier, while the embedded zinc alginate-polyurethane (ZAPU) layer combines active antibacterial properties with passive bacterial adhesion. The optimized ZAPU structure absorbs exudate and regulates the wound microenvironment, inhibiting bacterial proliferation and limiting infection spread. <i>In vitro</i> studies demonstrated that PINSHIELD inhibited <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>E. coli</i> by 90 %, with a bacterial blocking efficiency exceeding 95 %, significantly outperforming traditional gauze. <i>In vivo</i> results showed reduced inflammation, bacterial loads, and <i>Staphylococcus</i> abundance, while enhancing microbial diversity and enriching health-associated bacteria.

Nonetheless, there is a notable scarcity of research in the field of ruminant science regarding its effects on fattening sheep, particularly with respect to the rumen microbiota. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of varied DCAD levels on growth performance, rumen fermentation, and rumen bacterial communities in fattening Hu sheep. Thirty-six fattening male sheep (20.66 ± 1.53 kg) were divided into two blocks based on body weight (BW), and the sheep in each block were then randomly assigned to one of three dietary treatments: low DCAD (LD, 2.3 mEq/kg of dry matter [DM]), medium DCAD (MD, 132.1 mEq/kg of DM), and high DCAD (HD, 276.9 mEq/kg of DM). The experiment lasted for 10 weeks, with 2 weeks of adaptation and 8 weeks of measurements and sampling. This experiment found that DCAD levels did not affect dry matter intake (DMI), average daily gain (ADG), or feed conversion efficiency of gain (G:F) of fattening Hu sheep (<i>P</i> > 0.05). However, the high DCAD level resulted in a linear increase in the apparent digestibilities of DM, organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and ether extract (EE) (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Additionally, rumen pH exhibited a linear increase (<i>P</i> = 0.005) with the increase in DCAD level, while the concentrations of isobutyrate, isovalerate, and total branched-chain volatile fatty acids (BCVFA) displayed quadratic effects (<i>P</i> < 0.05), with the MD group showing the lowest values.

A total of 18 healthy Holstein calves (age 8 ± 3 days, weight 42.48 ± 1.04 kg) were raised in a centralized manner to minimize differences and then divided into two groups: one group received LGG supplementation (1 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFU per calf per day), while the other served as the control (CON). Each group consisted of 9 replicates, with 1 calf per replicate. The experimental period spanned 6 weeks. The experimental results demonstrated an increase of the average daily growth (<i>P</i> = 0.094) and a highly significant reduction in diarrhea (<i>P</i> = 0.001) for the LGG group compared with the CON group. The supplementation of LGG resulted in an increased abundance of endogenous beneficial bacteria in the gut including <i>Lysinbacillus</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.012) and <i>Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.041) while reducing levels of pathogenic bacteria in the <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.066). These particular groups could serve as biomarker bacteria for calf diarrhea and gut health. The alteration of metabolite production and metabolic pathways were also closely associated with the variation of bacterial composition in the gut microbiome of calves, of which included enrichment of biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, α-linolenic acid and steroid biosynthesis. Overall, LGG administration had a positive impact on improving the intestinal homeostasis, alleviating diarrhea, and enhancing growth performance by modulating gut bacteria and metabolites in pre-weaning calves. Thus, LGG could be a potential alternative to prophylactic antibiotic treatment that would lower associated costs and provide new insights into preventing and treating calf diarrhea.","The aim of the present study was to investigate whether <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> GG (LGG) could be utilized as an effective strategy to promote growth performance of calves and to further study its impact on decreasing diarrhea.

A prospective observational multicenter study was conducted, collecting clinical data from pediatric patients diagnosed with MPP in four hospitals across China from December 1 to December 31, 2023. Targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) results and clinical characteristics were analyzed. Participants were divided into mild and severe groups according to disease severity. Severe cases were further subdivided into an MP alone group and a multi-pathogen co-detection group. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the predictive performance of inflammatory biomarkers for multi-pathogen co-detection. A total of 266 children were enrolled. Severe cases had significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) levels, as well as longer hospital stays (all <i>P</i> < 0.05).

Obtaining kinetic constants in rate laws for nucleation and growth of advanced biotherapeutics such as capsids, an assembly of macromolecules, is challenging and essential to the design of crystallization processes. In this work, coupled population balance and species balance equations are developed to extract nucleation and growth kinetics for the crystallization of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) capsids. A comparison of model results with that of experimental data for capsid crystallization in a hanging-drop vapor diffusion system shows that the slow rate of vapor diffusion from the droplet controls the initial nucleation and growth processes, and the capsid nucleation occurs via heterogeneous nucleation in the microdroplet. Results also show that the capsids, which are of very high molecular weight (∼3.6 MDa), have a similar tendency to nucleate as small organic molecules such as glycine (∼75 Da), low-molecular-weight proteins, and small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients due to their ball-shaped outer structure/shape. Capsids also show a prolonged nucleation period as for proteins and other macromolecules but have a slow growth rate with a growth rate prefactor seven orders of magnitude smaller than that of lysozyme. The capsid crystal growth rate is weakly sensitive to supersaturation compared to lysozyme and is limited by the transport of capsids due to slow Brownian motion resulting from the very high molecular weight.","Crystallization of proteins, specifically proteins of medical relevance, is performed for various reasons, such as to understand the protein structure and to design therapies.

This pilot study evaluated the feasibility, fidelity, acceptability and preliminary effects of a mobile phone counselling intervention among perinatal women living with HIV and depression in India. Forty women in their third trimester (≥28 weeks of gestation) and screening positive for depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ≥13) were recruited from three government-run treatment centres in Delhi. Participants were randomized to: (a) the intervention condition, 'BEST-ma-CARE' mobile phone counselling, or (b) an attention control condition, time- and phone-matched perinatal wellness counselling. All counselling was delivered via basic mobile phones. Data were collected at baseline and follow-up at 36-40 weeks pregnancy, within 7 days of delivery and at 6 and 12 weeks postpartum. Overall, 82% of the participants completed the study, with higher retention in the intervention arm (90%). Engagement was also higher in the intervention group with 78% of antenatal and 95% of postnatal calls attended, compared to 70% and 80% in the control group. The intervention was highly acceptable; 76% reported it 'helped them a lot', compared to 69% in the control group. All participants (100%) appreciated scheduled counsellor calls. Both groups showed reductions in depressive symptoms and perceived illness severity, while internalized stigma increased only in the control group. Improvements in antiretroviral adherence, viral load and CD4 counts were stronger in the intervention group.

Monoclonal antibodies were shown to be effective, but as the SARS-CoV-2 mutated, these antibodies became ineffective. Small-molecule antivirals were identified using pseudovirus constructs to recapitulate infection in nonhuman cells, such as Vero E6 cells. However, the impact was limited due to poor translation of these compounds in the clinical setting.

Using high-content imaging combined with single-cell and multidimensional analysis, we identified antibodies and kinase inhibitors that reduce viral infection without affecting the host. Our screening technique uncovered novel antibodies and overlooked kinase inhibitors (i.e., PIK3i, mTORi, and multiple RTKi) that could be effective against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Further characterization of these molecules will streamline the repurposing of compounds for the treatment of future pandemics and uncover novel mechanisms viruses use to hijack and infect host cells.","The sudden rise of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the delay in development of effective therapeutics for mitigation made evident a need for ways to screen compounds that can block infection and prevent further pathogenesis and spread.

Yet most prior research focuses only on ovary dysfunction. Our work evaluates literature mechanisms of DM-induced uterine tube and endometrial dysfunction, corresponding impacts on female fertility, and potential evidence-based intervention targets. We conducted a scoping review (mapping review) follows the Joanna Briggs Institute (Manual for Evidence Synthesis, 2020 version). After identifying the research questions, we conducted a comprehensive search across four electronic databases by entering the keyword ""diabetes"", with a combination with other keywords as the uterus, endometrium, uterine/Fallopian tube, infertility and embryo implantation. We excluded manuscripts that address the issue of gestational diabetes. Most of these studies were in animals. There is compelling evidence for connecting DM with uterine tube infertility <i>via</i> endometriosis, thyroid dysfunction, and susceptibility to infectious disease. DM damages the endometrium before pregnancy <i>via</i> glucose toxicity, lesions, excessive immune activity, and other mechanisms. DM also hinders endometrium receptivity and embryo-endometrium crosstalk, such as through disrupted endometrium glucose homeostasis. We also hypothesize how DM may affect the function of immune cells in uterine tube and uterus, including changes in the number and types of cells of innate and acquired immunity, disrupting immunological barrier in uterine tube, alterations in formation of neutrophil extracellular traps or polarization of macrophages. We discuss evidence for clinical practice in terms of glycaemic control, lifestyle modifications, and medical interventions. For example, there is currently substantial evidence from rodent models for using metformin for increase in endometrial thickness, number of stromal cells and blood vessels and restoration of normal endometrial architecture, and bariatric surgery for recruitment of protective immune cell types to the endometrium. We also briefly highlight the future prospects of stem cells, artificial intelligence, and other new approaches for managing DM-associated female infertility.

DM also hinders endometrium receptivity and embryo-endometrium crosstalk, such as through disrupted endometrium glucose homeostasis. We also hypothesize how DM may affect the function of immune cells in uterine tube and uterus, including changes in the number and types of cells of innate and acquired immunity, disrupting immunological barrier in uterine tube, alterations in formation of neutrophil extracellular traps or polarization of macrophages. We discuss evidence for clinical practice in terms of glycaemic control, lifestyle modifications, and medical interventions. For example, there is currently substantial evidence from rodent models for using metformin for increase in endometrial thickness, number of stromal cells and blood vessels and restoration of normal endometrial architecture, and bariatric surgery for recruitment of protective immune cell types to the endometrium. We also briefly highlight the future prospects of stem cells, artificial intelligence, and other new approaches for managing DM-associated female infertility. Further studies are necessary for optimizing female reproductive outcomes.",PubMed
10.32604/or.2025.062207,Molecular insights into immune evasion in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas: Toward a promising treatment strategy.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a highly aggressive and devastating disease arising primarily from the mucosal epithelium of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx. HNSCC ranks as the sixth most common cancer worldwide, carrying significant morbidity and mortality. HPV-positive HNSCC can be partially prevented with the FDA-approved HPV vaccine and generally exhibits a more favorable prognosis compared to HPV-negative cases. However, effective screening and treatment approaches remain elusive for HPV-negative HNSCC. While precancerous lesions may precede invasive cancer in certain situations, most patients present with advanced disease without prior indication of precancerous conditions. Despite robust immune cell infiltration in HNSCC tumors, the extent and composition of immune infiltration vary widely among patients, and these tumors often evade immune surveillance through diverse mechanisms. Given the heterogeneous nature of HNSCC influenced by anatomical location and etiological factors, precise identification of biomarkers and personalized treatment strategies are imperative. In this study, we aim to explore the possibility of establishing an effective treatment strategy to overcome obstacles to targeted treatment and enable long-term survival through detailed molecular characterization and immune profiling of HNSCC.","Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a highly aggressive and devastating disease arising primarily from the mucosal epithelium of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx.

While the impact of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be diminishing in daily life, only a limited number of drugs have received approval or emergency use authorization for its treatment. Given the high mutation rate of viral genomes, host-directed agents (HDAs) have emerged as a preferred choice due to their broad applicability and lasting effectiveness. In contrast to direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), HDAs offer several advantages, including broad-spectrum antiviral activities, potential efficacy against future emerging viruses, and a lower likelihood of inducing drug resistance. In our review article, we have synthesized known host-directed antiviral targets that span diverse cellular pathways and mechanisms, shedding light on the intricate interplay between host cells and viruses. Additionally, we have provided a brief overview of the development of HDAs based on these targets.

Yellow Wine Polyphenolic Compounds, a dietary polyphenol with significant antioxidant effects, have been shown to offer protection in various cardiovascular diseases. However, their role in MIRI remains under-researched. <i>In vivo</i> experiments, TTC staining was used to assess myocardial viability, and cardiac ultrasound was employed to measure left ventricular ejection function. Morphological staining and detection of myocardial injury markers were used to evaluate cardiac damage. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe mitochondrial morphology in myocardial tissue, and ELISA was performed to evaluate the activity of mitochondrial complexes. Adeno-associated virus knockdown was utilized to verify the role of Nrf2. In <i>in vitro</i> experiments, confocal microscopy was used to scan mitochondrial morphology in cardiomyocytes and to observe the intracellular localization of the Nrf2 molecule. TTC staining showed that MIRI significantly increased the infarct size in the left ventricle, whereas pre-treatment with YWPC (Yellow Wine Polyphenol Compound) significantly reduced the infarct area. Cardiac ultrasound demonstrated that YWPC intervention preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. Morphological staining and detection of myocardial injury markers revealed that MIRI caused tissue edema, increased myocardial apoptosis and damage, but YWPC pre-treatment alleviated these injuries. Transmission electron microscopy showed that YWPC reversed the excessive mitochondrial fission caused by MIRI. Immunofluorescence indicated that YWPC significantly promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation and increased the expression of downstream antioxidant molecules. YWPC pre-treatment can protect myocardial tissue by reducing the excessive mitochondrial fission induced by MIRI, and Nrf2 mediates these effects.","Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury is a pathological phenomenon that occurs after coronary blood flow restoration and poses a threat to patients' lives.

Surveillance using Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) has shown promise in human health settings; more evidence on its applicability and acceptability in livestock populations is needed. Drawing on in-depth interviews, this article examines stakeholder perspectives on LQAS for AMR surveillance in livestock in Germany. Twenty-five stakeholders were interviewed. They included employees of German universities, research institutes, Federal animal health services / veterinary laboratories, animal producer associations, and veterinarians. Detailed notes of online interviews were analyzed using a framework approach. Respondents were concerned about AMR in livestock and also about restrictions on antibiotic treatment options. They described the multifaceted, legally prescribed data gathering for farmers to monitor antibiotic consumption and the widespread use of antibiograms to guide treatment in Germany. Respondents saw potential benefits of LQAS for AMR surveillance, in terms of reducing the sample sizes and the need for antibiotic susceptibility tests, but there were questions about surveilling commensal bacteria, with concerns about it leading to further restrictions on antibiotic consumption and driving food production overseas. An LQAS approach to AMR surveillance requires locally responsive guidance to alleviate concerns about further restriction of treatment options (and about animal welfare). Given existing data collection, recording and reporting burden for farmers and veterinarians, early engagement is needed to agree the rationale and benefits of LQAS, particularly if surveilling resistance in commensal bacteria is considered.","Bacterial pathogens exhibiting antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are a health threat for humans, companion animals and livestock.

This review explores the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and the risk of sHLH in leukemia patients living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this population, the compounded effects of immunosuppression and inflammatory conditions present unique challenges, making it crucial to understand the role of BMI in modulating these risks. Leukemia and HIV independently contribute to significant immune system dysregulation. When these conditions coexist, patients face increased susceptibility to infections and inflammatory disorders. BMI, an indicator of nutritional and metabolic status, can further influence immune responses. Low BMI, often associated with malnutrition, impairs immune function, while high BMI, linked to obesity, promotes chronic inflammation. Both extremes can exacerbate the cytokine storm characteristic of sHLH, leading to more severe clinical outcomes. Regular monitoring and addressing nutritional status through tailored interventions can potentially mitigate the risk of sHLH. A multidisciplinary approach, integrating the expertise of oncologists, infectious disease specialists, nutritionists, and immunologists, is essential for optimizing patient care and improving outcomes in this vulnerable population.

However, it remains a potentially life-threatening diagnosis with a mortality rate of 24.6% at 5 years for severe cases. We presented a rare case of PAN with severe renal and gastrointestinal involvement at presentation. A 21-year-old male presented with sudden severe right flank pain radiating to the back. He was noted to have reticular purple skin lesions on his abdomen and lower legs. Clinical and laboratory findings indicated that he had a hemorrhagic shock. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a ruptured, partially thrombosed pseudoaneurysm of an accessory right renal artery with acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage, splenic infarcts, and two lower mesenteric artery aneurysms. Selective coil embolization of the ruptured artery was successfully conducted. Notably, the patient reports a 1-year history of intermittent abdominal pain, bilateral foot pain, and livedo reticularis, alongside left testicular pain managed with varicocelectomy. During the hospital stay, the patient developed progressive bilateral lower limb weakness that nerve conduction studies revealed it as mononeuritis multiplex. These combined findings were pointing toward PAN diagnosis. Therefore, the patient was started on pulse steroid and cyclophosphamide therapy. However, his abdominal pain worsened requiring surgical exploration with extensive bowel resection, after which plasmapheresis was commenced. After our patient presented with life-threatening retroperitoneal bleeding, CT scan revealed that an accessory renal artery had ruptured, and also revealed the hidden cause of his chronic, recurrent, self-resolving attacks of severe abdominal pain, which were investigated multiple times by endoscopy without appropriate diagnosis. The final diagnosis of PAN was supported by the presence of livedo reticularis, testicular ischemia, chronic abdominal pain, and mononeuritis multiplex, fulfilling four diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology for PAN. Renal involvement in PAN can be in up to 75% of cases. However, rupture of accessory renal artery aneurysms is infrequent and it was the first presenting symptom of our patient. Similarly, GI complications are observed in 50% of patients, which can progress to life-threatening ischemia and gangrene, as seen in this case. Treatment involved corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide as an induction therapy based on the 2011 revised Five-Factor Score (FFS). The addition of plasma exchange therapy in this patient was due to the catastrophic complications of PAN. Eventually, the patient became clinically stable with an expected 5-year survival rate of 65.0% according to his FFS ≥2. Therefore, careful follow-up is necessary. Even though vascular aneurysms in PAN have a long history, they are more often linked to gradual development rather than to catastrophic events. Acute rupture resulting in hemorrhagic shock is rarely the initial sign of PAN. Rare reports of renal artery rupture in PAN highlight the significance of having a high level of clinical suspicion in young patients with unexplained vascular events. Early diagnosis and rapid management, including immunosuppressive therapy and plasmapheresis, are crucial in preventing severe outcomes. Despite a poor prognosis associated with severe disease features, careful management can stabilize the patient, although long-term follow-up remains essential.","Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis primarily affecting medium-sized vessels. It has several clinical manifestations, including renal, gastrointestinal, cutaneous, neurologic, and general symptoms, but it is not associated with pulmonary manifestations. PAN mainly affects individuals aged 40-60 years, with a male predominance. Although the underlying cause of this disease remains unclear, several triggers can be associated with it such as hepatitis B virus.

This manuscript examines the psychological toll of the outbreak on individuals, families, and communities, with a particular focus on high-risk groups such as individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions, healthcare providers, and those grieving under disrupted cultural mourning practices. Drawing on lessons from past crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the paper advocates for targeted and culturally sensitive mental health initiatives to address immediate psychological distress and build long-term resilience. While Rwanda's mental health system has made significant progress since the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, the MVD outbreak emphasizes the necessity of fostering structured interventions to address compounded psychological challenges among high-risk groups. Strengthened referral mechanisms, interdisciplinary collaboration, and scalable mental health policies aligned with broader epidemic preparedness frameworks are essential to achieving this goal. By prioritizing these measures, Rwanda can enhance its capacity to respond effectively to mental health challenges during public health emergencies, fostering resilience and societal well-being.","The Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreak in Rwanda highlights the critical need to foster structured mental health interventions as an integral part of epidemic response strategies.

10.1097/ms9.0000000000003351,Rapid onset of neurological symptoms in an HIV-positive patient with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: a case report.,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by substantial damage to oligodendrocytes. It clinically presents as movement impairment, cognitive disability, language aphasia, dysarthria, and visual impairments. It was first identified in 1958. It is commonly associated with either Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A 40-year-old male Asian farmer presented with altered behavior, fever, and weakness on the right side of his body after suffering a widespread tonic-clonic seizure. His medical background included a tonsillectomy, treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, and hepatitis C (negative polymerase chain reaction). On admission, he had asymmetric plantar responses, pallor, brisk deep tendon reflexes, an oral thrush, and decreased strength and tone in the muscles on his right side. The findings of the laboratory tests revealed elevated pH, red blood cells, lymphocytes, and protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, abnormal liver function tests, and no bacterial growth. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral parietal, temporal, and frontal lobe high signal lesions (T2W, FLAIR sequences), with more severe lesions in the left lobe and no contrast enhancement, consistent with the imaging features of PML. According to the spinal tap, the patient was JC virus-positive. HIV testing indicated a significant viral load, and electroencephalogram recorded seizures. JC virus reactivation causes PML, a serious brain condition in patients with weak immune systems. HIV and immunosuppressive drugs are thought to be the potential risk factors behind the reactivation of the JC virus and the appearance of PML. Symptoms like seizures and fever are not usually associated with PML, but the presence of these symptoms hints toward the complexity of the diagnosis of this case. Doctors should focus on treating the root cause of the weakened immune system to help patients. PML was identified by combining the results of an MRI scan with the patient's HIV status and the results of a spinal tap. The patient's health deteriorated even after receiving corticosteroids, acyclovir, nutritional supplements, and palliative therapy. As time passed, he developed neurological complications, respiratory failure, and ultimately death. This case highlights the more aggressive and unique course of PML in HIV patients, it underscores the importance of assessment of the neurological symptoms in high-risk individuals. As PML carries high mortality risk it necessitates prompt diagnosis and treatment with antiretroviral drugs to slow the disease progression.","Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by substantial damage to oligodendrocytes.

10.7759/cureus.83720,A Rare Fatal Case of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis With Central Pontine Myelinolysis in the Setting of Epstein-Barr Virus Reactivation.,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare hyperinflammatory disorder associated with infections, malignancies, autoimmune conditions, and inflammatory states. HLH is characterized by unregulated cytokine release and immune activation, leading to widespread tissue damage. In this case, we describe a male in his 30s who presented to the emergency department with concerns about sepsis after being diagnosed with mastoiditis a week earlier. Further investigation revealed persistent fevers, pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, hyperferritinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for HLH. Additional serologic testing revealed a significantly elevated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral load on PCR, with positive immunoglobulin G (IgG) and negative IgM, consistent with EBV reactivation. HLH in the setting of EBV reactivation is rare and may be associated with a poor prognosis. Central pontine myelinolysis is a commonly fatal neurologic condition that is rarely attributed to HLH but should be considered when other causes are ruled out such as electrolyte derangements and rapid correction.","Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare hyperinflammatory disorder associated with infections, malignancies, autoimmune conditions, and inflammatory states.

We present the case of a 50-year-old woman with a sudden, severe headache. Computed tomography (CT) of the head was normal, but lumbar puncture revealed xanthochromia, elevated CSF protein (139.5 mg/dL), and no red or white blood cells. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) was detected by CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and MRI demonstrated chronic cervicomedullary stenosis without evidence of hemorrhage or encephalitis. The patient was treated empirically with intravenous acyclovir and fully recovered. The findings suggest a mixed etiology for xanthochromia involving partial mechanical obstruction of CSF flow and a subclinical viral process. This case highlights the importance of considering infectious, inflammatory, and structural causes in the differential diagnosis of xanthochromia when SAH is excluded.","Xanthochromia in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is most commonly associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but other etiologies must be considered when initial imaging is unremarkable.

While the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib has been the standard first-line therapy, another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, lenvatinib, has recently gained attention as a potential alternative. However, local data comparing their effectiveness and safety is scarce. The aim of the study was to assess the clinical profile of patients with advanced HCC and treatment outcomes with sorafenib or lenvatinib in a tertiary care setting in Pakistan. Methods This retrospective, data-based study was conducted at the Department of Medical Oncology, Nawaz Sharif Social Security Teaching Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. Medical records of 104 patients classified as having Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) stage C HCC were included. Patients with incomplete medical records, missing essential clinical data, those lost to follow-up, or who died before initiation of treatment were excluded from the analysis. Demographic information, including age, gender, hepatitis B and C status, and co-morbid conditions, was evaluated. For documentation of baseline parameters, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, number of lesions on CT scan, evidence of invasive or metastatic disease, and liver function parameters categorized by Child-Pugh class (A to C) were assessed. Treatment records were examined to determine whether patients received Sorafenib or Lenvatinib, and the outcome and adverse effects were noted. Results of follow-up CT scan performed at six months were used as the primary outcome measure to assess disease status, categorized as complete resolution, partial resolution, or no response/progression. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 23 (IBM Inc., Armonk, New York). Results The mean age of the patients was 64.9±8.3 years, with 74 (71.2%) males. All patients had advanced HCC at BCLC stage C. Chronic hepatitis C was reported in 92 (88.5%) patients, while chronic hepatitis B in 02 (1.9%). The most frequent co-morbid conditions were hypertension (26, 25.0%) and diabetes mellitus (18, 17.3%). The majority of the patients (40, 38.5%) had grade 2 ECOG performance status, with 68 (65.4%) having multifocal HCC and 62 (59.6%) vascular invasion. Metastases were seen in 38 (36.5%) patients, with nodal metastasis being the most frequent site (18, 17.3%). The mean Child-Pugh score was 6.5±1.3, with the majority of the patients (62, 59.6%) having Child-Pugh class A. With regards to treatment, 66 (63.5%) patients received sorafenib while 38 (36.5%) received lenvatinib.

10.7759/cureus.83661,Differing Rates of Carbapenem Resistance in Gram-Negative Bacteria Within Lower and Higher Socioeconomic Classes in Eastern India.,"Background Over the last 50 years, medical science has witnessed the emergence of antibacterial resistance at a concerning rate. Southeast Asia has become a leading epicenter for the development and spread of carbapenem-resistant bacterial strains. Socioeconomic background, being a major health determinant, can heavily affect this rate of antibiotic resistance.  Methods This retrospective study was conducted at a 1,700-bed tertiary care facility in Kolkata, India, between October 2023 and January 2024. A total of 248 culture results from urine, sputum, blood, wound, and ascitic fluid, which showed growth of Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and coccobacilli (GNCB) during the study period, were analyzed. Medical records were reviewed to collect demographic and clinical data. The comparison was made between two population groups based on economic status, identified by ration cards as defined by the Government of West Bengal, India.  Results This study assessed the prevalence and antibiotic resistance patterns of Gram-negative bacteria in clinical samples, focusing on urine, blood, sputum, wound, and ascitic fluid. The analysis revealed that GNB were widely distributed across sample types, while GNCB showed higher prevalence in blood and ascitic fluid. Antibiotic resistance was notably prevalent among GNB, with 49 (27.5%) resistant to imipenem and 50 (28.1%) to meropenem. GNCB exhibited lower resistance, with six (14.3%) resistant to imipenem, eight (19.0%) to meropenem, and seven (16.7%) to doripenem. A comparison of carbapenem resistance (CR) between higher and lower socioeconomic classes showed no statistically significant differences, with resistance rates of 15 (41.7%) and 96 (45.3%), respectively. Further analysis of the most common isolates (<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, <i>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>) also revealed no significant correlation between socioeconomic status and resistance, emphasizing that antibiotic resistance is a widespread issue transcending economic boundaries.  Conclusion This study examines CR in Gram-negative bacteria across socioeconomic groups in Eastern India, finding no significant differences in resistance between higher and lower economic classes. Both groups showed similar levels of resistance, highlighting that antibiotic misuse, overprescription, and inadequate stewardship are pervasive issues transcending economic boundaries. The study emphasizes the need for enhanced healthcare provider training, public education on antibiotic misuse, and policy interventions to improve sanitation and waste management. Effective antibiotic stewardship and public health measures are crucial for combating resistance and ensuring equitable health outcomes.","Background Over the last 50 years, medical science has witnessed the emergence of antibacterial resistance at a concerning rate. Southeast Asia has become a leading epicenter for the development and spread of carbapenem-resistant bacterial strains. Socioeconomic background, being a major health determinant, can heavily affect this rate of antibiotic resistance.  Methods This retrospective study was conducted at a 1,700-bed tertiary care facility in Kolkata, India, between October 2023 and January 2024. A total of 248 culture results from urine, sputum, blood, wound, and ascitic fluid, which showed growth of Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and coccobacilli (GNCB) during the study period, were analyzed. Medical records were reviewed to collect demographic and clinical data. The comparison was made between two population groups based on economic status, identified by ration cards as defined by the Government of West Bengal, India.  Results This study assessed the prevalence and antibiotic resistance patterns of Gram-negative bacteria in clinical samples, focusing on urine, blood, sputum, wound, and ascitic fluid. The analysis revealed that GNB were widely distributed across sample types, while GNCB showed higher prevalence in blood and ascitic fluid. Antibiotic resistance was notably prevalent among GNB, with 49 (27.5%) resistant to imipenem and 50 (28.1%) to meropenem. GNCB exhibited lower resistance, with six (14.3%) resistant to imipenem, eight (19.0%) to meropenem, and seven (16.7%) to doripenem. A comparison of carbapenem resistance (CR) between higher and lower socioeconomic classes showed no statistically significant differences, with resistance rates of 15 (41.7%) and 96 (45.3%), respectively.

Additionally, complications involving influenza virus infections in STSS cases have been reported more frequently than in the pre-pandemic period. We report the case of a 69-year-old man who presented to the ED with progressive dyspnea and fever, without any signs suggestive of soft tissue infection. Chest CT revealed right-sided pneumonia, and a rapid influenza test returned positive. On the second day of hospitalization, <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> (emm1) was isolated from both blood and sputum cultures. Despite aggressive intensive care, including fluid resuscitation, vasoactive support, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly. He died 24 hours after admission to the ICU. STSS is a rapidly progressing disease with a high mortality rate, capable of causing severe clinical decline within a short time. Clinicians should remain vigilant for the rising occurrence of STSS and influenza coinfections during the COVID-19 era to improve differential diagnosis and optimize early treatment strategies.","Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) has increased.

This review explores the impact of some relatively new discoveries in the field of flipon biology that provide insight into diseases associated with impaired memory function. I examine how an ancient immune system based on Z-DNA and Z-RNA (collectively called ZNAs) regulates pathways that impact the memories modeled by synapses. The outcomes depend on intracellular defenses activated by endogenous retroelements (ERE) and virus, and on extracellular responses to ZNAs in bacterial biofilms. The bacterial amyloids and complement activation pathways further exacerbate the decline of cognitive and affective functions by inducing remodeling of synapses. In addition to immune EREs, a class of memory EREs potentially acts as ribotransmitters. These RNAs are transported across the synapse to program the connections between neurons that underlie the formation and remodeling of memories. Examples exist of ribotransmitters derived from ERE transcripts and assembled into capsids capable of transsynaptic transmission. In contrast, the immune EREs protect the nervous system by dismantling synapses to prevent viruses and retrotransposons from crossing them. The complexity of the interactions between memory and immune EREs likely give rise to the inverted U-shaped dose-response curves for the therapeutics currently available to treat cognitive decline. Other approaches for disease prevention are suggested, along with those that promote the regeneration and reprogramming of neuronal circuits.","Our memories are almost magical.

HDV is a satellite virus of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and depends on the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for envelopment and viral entry. Tobevibart (VIR-3434) is an investigational monoclonal antibody targeting the antigenic loop of HBsAg. Elebsiran (VIR-2218) is an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting a highly conserved region within the HBV genome. The aim of this study was to investigate the antiviral effect of tobevibart and elebsiran on HDV infection in preclinical models. <i>In vitro</i> antiviral activity was determined in an HBV/HDV coinfection model in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) or Huh7-NTCP cells. The <i>in vivo</i> efficacy of a murinized version of tobevibart alone or in combination with elebsiran was evaluated in HBV/HDV-coinfected liver-chimeric mice. Elebsiran treatment reduced levels of secreted HBsAg and infectious HDV with picomolar potency. Tobevibart exhibited pan-genotypic neutralizing activity against all tested HDV genotypes with EC<sub>50</sub> ranging from 1.1 to 4.6 ng/ml.

This review aims to evaluate the various methodologies available for monitoring the effects of immunosuppression in individual patients. While the initial focus was on directly assessing the impact of immunosuppressive treatments, we found limited evidence in this area. Instead, much of the available research is focused on predicting specific outcomes and indirectly assessing immunosuppression needs in lung transplant recipients. In this review, we provide an overview of the different methodologies that can be utilized to enhance the personalization of immunosuppressive therapy following lung transplantation. These include enzymatic monitoring, T-cell mediated functional assays, monitoring of lymphocyte subsets, gene expression profiling, and viral load measurements.

It is reported that KRAS could promote proliferation of osteosarcoma (OS) cells. Nonetheless, the contribution of KRAS to the invasion and spread of OS is still not well understood. This study aimed to investigate KRAS-driven metastasis and the mechanisms behind it in human OS. Tissue microarrays were utilized to assess KRAS expression and its relationship with clinicopathological characteristics. The migratory and invasive abilities of OS cells were evaluated through wound-healing assays and transwell analysis. Furthermore, the regulatory mechanisms of KRAS in human OS were analyzed using RNA sequencing, tandem mass tags assays, multiple immunofluorescence assays, micro-CT, and bioluminescence imaging. In vivo experiments were conducted using established lung metastatic models. Our data showed that downregulation of KRAS in human OS cells could inhibit cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo (tumor metastasis model by tail vein injection in BALB/c nude mice). We identify IL-17A, a crucial marker of IL-17 signal pathway, as a downstream target of KRAS. The reduction of KRAS may suppress matrix metalloproteinase (MMP1), MMP3, and MMP9, which are recognized as proteins associated with tumor metastasis, through a mechanism dependent on IL-17 signaling. In summary, these findings indicate that KRAS could serve as a potential biomarker for therapeutic strategies in human OS.

Misdiagnosis of TB co-infections accelerate disease progression and contribute to the development of drug resistance, leading to higher mortality and morbidity rates, especially in underserved areas. This study aimed to investigate bacterial co-infections in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in a rural Vhembe region of Limpopo, South Africa. A total of 100 sputum together with 100 blood samples were collected from TB patients who were undergoing TB treatment. DNA isolates were used as templates for PCR using the Anyplex™MTB/NTMe Assay kit, and subsequently, the Allplex™ MTB/MDR/XDRe Assay kit was used for the multiple detections of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB) and resistance to first line and second line anti-TB drugs. Co-infections were determined using the Allplex™ Bacteria(I) & (II) Assay kit. HIV status of patients was determined using blood testing kits. Majority of study participants were male (55 %) and aged between 36 and 55 (54 %), while female were 46 % of the population. Bacterial species detected included non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in 67 % of participants, Aeromonas spp. (19 %), Vibrio spp. (2 %), and E. coli (2 %). Multidrug-resistant <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB) strains were identified in 2 % of the cohort. There was a significant association between employment status and age (p = 0.00), as well as between HIV status and age (p = 0.03). While no significant associations were found between HIV status and the presence of NTM or other bacterial co-infections (p = 0.19 and 0.21, respectively), the majority of Aeromonas spp. and NTM cases were observed among HIV-positive participants. Notably, 36 of the NTM cases occurred in individuals living with HIV.

Misdiagnosis of TB co-infections accelerate disease progression and contribute to the development of drug resistance, leading to higher mortality and morbidity rates, especially in underserved areas. This study aimed to investigate bacterial co-infections in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in a rural Vhembe region of Limpopo, South Africa. A total of 100 sputum together with 100 blood samples were collected from TB patients who were undergoing TB treatment. DNA isolates were used as templates for PCR using the Anyplex™MTB/NTMe Assay kit, and subsequently, the Allplex™ MTB/MDR/XDRe Assay kit was used for the multiple detections of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB) and resistance to first line and second line anti-TB drugs. Co-infections were determined using the Allplex™ Bacteria(I) & (II) Assay kit. HIV status of patients was determined using blood testing kits. Majority of study participants were male (55 %) and aged between 36 and 55 (54 %), while female were 46 % of the population. Bacterial species detected included non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in 67 % of participants, Aeromonas spp. (19 %), Vibrio spp. (2 %), and E. coli (2 %). Multidrug-resistant <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB) strains were identified in 2 % of the cohort. There was a significant association between employment status and age (p = 0.00), as well as between HIV status and age (p = 0.03). While no significant associations were found between HIV status and the presence of NTM or other bacterial co-infections (p = 0.19 and 0.21, respectively), the majority of Aeromonas spp. and NTM cases were observed among HIV-positive participants. Notably, 36 of the NTM cases occurred in individuals living with HIV. The study findings suggest that age, socioeconomic status, and gender play a role in the development of TB, HIV, and other bacterial infections, which could further complicate treatment outcomes in patients. These factors likely contribute to increased vulnerability to co-infections, emphasizing the complex interplay between TB and HIV in these populations.

Until recently, the only characterized alkaliphilic representative of this group was <i>Desulfurivibrio alkaliphilus</i>, originally isolated as an H<sub>2</sub>-dependent sulfur reducer. In this study, we describe the properties of a novel species within this genus, <i>Desulfurivibrio dismutans</i> strain AMeS2, which was originally enriched and isolated from a soda lake sample as an autotrophic elemental sulfur disproportionating bacterium. Similar to <i>D. alkaliphilus</i> AHT 2<sup>T</sup>, <i>D. dismutans</i> AMeS2 is an obligately alkaliphilic and moderately salt-tolerant autotrophic bacterium. In contrast to known neutrophilic sulfur disproportionating bacteria, it is capable of disproportionating sulfur without Fe(III). It can also grow by dissimilatory sulfur reduction to sulfide or nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) with formate (but not with H<sub>2</sub>) as the electron donor. The addition of formate to sulfur-disproportionating AMeS2 culture significantly increased the sulfur-reducing activity but did not completely abolish the oxidative branch of sulfur disproportionation. Genome analysis confirmed the presence of dissimilatory sulfur oxidation and dissimilatory sulfur and nitrate reduction machineries in the strain. S<sup>0</sup> disproportionation occurs by means of cytoplasmic dissimilatory sulfite reductase (Dsr) donating electrons to, and periplasmic polysulfide reductase (PsrABC) receiving electrons from the menaquinone pool. Nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) occurs by the combined action of a membrane formate dehydrogenase FdnGHI, periplasmic nitrate reductase, and octaheme <i>c</i> ammonifying nitrite reductase. Autotrophic growth is enabled by the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (WLP). The genome also encodes proteins that presumably connect the oxidative branch of sulfur disproportionation with the carbon (WLP) cycle. Comparative proteomics of cells grown by sulfur disproportionation and formate-dependent DNRA demonstrated overexpression of the genes encoding Psr and rDSR at sulfur-disproportionating conditions, confirming their key role in this process. On the contrary, the genes encoding DNRA proteins are upregulated in the presence of nitrate. Thus, genomic and proteomic analyses revealed the pathways for energy conservation in a new representative of <i>Desulfurivibrio</i> growing at DNRA and under the thermodynamically challenging conditions of sulfur disproportionation.","Elemental sulfur disproportionation combined with obligate autotrophy is a unique type of sulfur-based anaerobic metabolism known in a limited number of bacteria, primarily found among the members of <i>Desulfobacterota</i> phylum.

However, there is increasing concern about its potential impacts on soil microbial communities, which play crucial roles in maintaining soil functions, plant health, and crop productivity. While glyphosate can be inactivated in soil through strong sorption, desorption remains a significant challenge as glyphosate residues and metabolites can exert toxicity effects on agroecosystems, particularly by altering microbial diversity and functionality. This review synthesizes current knowledge on glyphosate's behavior in soils and advancements in metagenomics approaches (including their limitations) to better understand the complex interactions between glyphosate and microbial communities in genetically modified (GM) cropping systems. Glyphosate has demonstrated antimicrobial properties, inhibiting the growth of various bacteria and fungi. Conversely, other studies suggest that glyphosate may enhance microbial richness, promoting the proliferation of potential glyphosate degraders (e.g., <i>Bacillus</i>, <i>Stenetrophomonas</i>, <i>Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas,</i> and <i>Phenylobacterium</i>) and N<sub>2</sub> fixing bacteria (e.g., <i>Bradyrhizobium</i>, <i>Rhizobium</i>, and <i>Devosia</i>) in the bulk soil and rhizosphere of GM crops. These contrasting findings are influenced by factors such as soil types, glyphosate rates, and crop varieties. Moreover, the review highlights that methodological discrepancies, including variations in next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms and reference databases, contribute significantly to inconsistencies in the literature. These differences stem from varying levels of accuracy or annotation standards in the databases and NGS technologies used. To address these challenges, this study underscores the need for standardized molecular and bioinformatics approaches. Integrating advanced long-read sequencing technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore and PacBio, with compatible reference databases could provide more accurate and consistent analyses of microbial community composition at finer taxonomic levels. Such advancements could improve our understanding of how glyphosate influences the balance between pathogenic microorganisms and plant-growth-promoting microbes in GM cropping systems, ultimately informing sustainable agricultural practices.","Glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] is the most widely used systematic non-selective herbicide worldwide.

The results showed that the application of different concentrations of biochar acid extract and its compound aqueous enhanced tobacco plant dry matter accumulation, improved soil pH, increased available nitrogen and organic matter, and reduced potassium and phosphorus availability. Moreover, the effect of the compound water agent treatment group on soil nutrients was greater than that of the biochar acid extract treatment group.

In this study, we quantified microbial diversity using a fractionation method that separated particles into seven fine scale fractions (0.2-1.2, 1.2-5, 5-20, 20-53, 53-180,180-500, >500 μm), and included a spike-in standard for sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. Size fractionated organic carbon into the same fractions enabled the calculation of bacterial 16S rRNA copies per μg C and per liter. There was a large increase in the bacterial 16S rRNA copies/ug C and copies/L on particles >180 μm between the upper water column and the deep water column. Though the total concentration of organic C in particles decreased in the deep water column, the density of bacteria on large particles increased at depth. The microbial community varied statistically significantly as a function of particle size and depth. Quantitative abundance estimates found that ostensibly obligate free-living microbes, such as SAR11 and Thaumarcheota, were more abundant in the free-living fraction but also common and abundant in the particulate size fractions. Conversely, ostensibly obligate particle attached bacteria such as members of Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetes, while most abundant on particles, were also present in the free living fraction. Total bacterial abundance, and the abundance of many taxonomic groups, increased in the ODZ region, particularly in the free-living fraction. Contrastingly, in the non-buoyant plume, there were highly abundant bacteria in the 5-20 and 20-53 μm fractions but reduced bacteria present in the 53-180 and 180-500 μm fractions.

CMRFs were defined as per established criteria, with body mass index threshold of 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Liver-related events (LREs) included ascites, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), variceal bleeding, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality.

LREs occurred in 30 (2.9%) patients, with an incidence of 5.04 (3.48-7.30) per 1000 person-years (PY). All-cause mortality occurred in 32 (3.0%) patients, with an incidence of 5.36 (95% CI: 3.79-7.58) per 1000 PY, including 14 (1.3%) liver-related mortality. Among individual CMRFs, diabetes was associated with the greatest proportion of mortality (4.1%), LREs (7.0%), and extrahepatic events (4.5%), while dyslipidemia was associated with the lowest proportions (2.4%, 2.4% and 2.2%, respectively).

Comorbidities included human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), glioblastoma, breast cancer, arthritis, gastric cancer, and nephrotic syndrome. Common symptoms were hemiparesis, generalized seizures, headache, and confusion. Imaging often revealed ring-enhancing lesions with restricted diffusion on DWI.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is strongly recommended as a screening modality with contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and attenuated diffusion coefficient. However, there is a 10% rate of false negative, which could potentially impact management and prognosis. Our systematic review aims at identifying risk factors for false negative. <b>Materials and Methods</b>  A database search of our institutions plus a systematic literature review was conducted using MEDLINE/PubMed, including studies of brain abscesses misdiagnosed as brain tumors. Data on patient demographics, clinical presentations, imaging findings, pathogens, treatments, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed. We present a case of a 59-year-old male with HIV, who developed a brain abscess misdiagnosed as a tumor. Initial symptoms included left-side weakness and weight loss. Imaging showed a ring-enhancing lesion in the right thalamus. The abscess was caused by <i>T. gondii</i> , and the patient was treated with sulfadiazine, pyrimethamine, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole, achieving a GOS-E score of 8 at 1 year. <b>Results</b>  The review included 14 studies, with 1 additional illustrative case, encompassing a total of 15 cases.

The aim of this proof-of-concept study, which was performed in healthy adults, was to demonstrate that ingestion of live <i>O formigenes</i> is safe, can establish sustainable gut colonization, and reduce urinary oxalate excretion. Twenty-two healthy adults without a history of kidney stones and not colonized with <i>O formigenes</i> ingested diets controlled in oxalate and calcium. In these participants, 24-hour urine and stool oxalate levels were quantified using ion chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry before and after ingestion of <i>O formigenes</i>. All 22 participants were successfully colonized after a single dose of <i>O formigenes</i> (∼10<sup>10</sup> cells); 10 remained colonized for at least 1 year. Colonization was lost in 11 participants, of whom 9 reported antibiotic use. Six participants who lost colonization were redosed, and 5 were successfully recolonized. Stool oxalate concentration and urine oxalate excretion significantly decreased by 54% and 14%, respectively, with varied responses after colonization. Microbiome molecular analyses of precolonized stool samples highlighted the abundance and diversity of other potential oxalate-degrading bacteria, which may have influenced the effect of <i>O formigenes</i> colonization on urinary oxalate excretion. These findings support future investigations to examine the effectiveness of <i>O formigenes</i> colonization in reducing urinary oxalate excretion in disease cohorts, including calcium oxalate kidney stone formers with enteric hyperoxaluria.","Oxalate-degrading intestinal bacteria, including the oxalate-degrading specialist, <i>Oxalobacter formigenes (O formigenes),</i> have the potential to reduce urinary oxalate excretion in humans, and thus limit the risk of calcium oxalate kidney stone formation.

The fat mass and obesity-related gene (FTO) is emerging as a promising cancer therapeutic target; however, its role in the RT response has been underexplored. In our study, we found that both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of FTO enhanced the efficacy of RT in human and mouse HNSCC tumor xenografts. Mechanistically, inhibition of FTO improved the RT response in HPV- HNSCC cells, which was associated with increased DNA damage, reduced efficiency of homology directed repair, and decreased formation of RAD51 homolog 1 (RAD51) foci. Importantly, pharmacologic inhibition of FTO did not exacerbate radiation-induced oral mucositis, a significant normal-tissue toxicity associated with HNSCC RT. In summary, our results indicate a role for FTO in regulating homologous recombination while identifying FTO as a potential therapeutic target to enhance the therapeutic index of RT in HPV- HNSCC treatment.","Despite aggressive chemoradiation treatment, the overall survival rate for patients with HPV- head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains poor, highlighting the urgent need for more effective drug-radiotherapy combinations to improve the therapeutic index of radiation therapy (RT).

ARDS has a high mortality rate and no proven pharmacological treatments, stressing the need for new targeted therapies. The TIP peptide, mimicking the lectin-like domain of TNF, directly binds to the α subunit of the epithelial Na+ channel, expressed in both alveolar epithelial and capillary endothelial cells, and may increase lung endothelial barrier function and alveolar fluid clearance during bacterial infection. This study tested these potential therapeutic mechanisms of the TIP peptide in a clinically relevant preparation of the ex vivo-perfused human lung injured by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Therapeutic administration of the TIP peptide reduced pulmonary barrier permeability to protein and lung edema formation, increased alveolar edema fluid clearance, and produced an antiinflammatory effect in the airspaces with reductions in IL-6 and IL-8 levels. Additionally, the TIP peptide reduced the translocation of bacteria into the circulation. These findings establish 3 mechanisms of benefit with the TIP peptide to reduce injury in the human lung and support the clinical relevance as a potential therapeutic for pneumococcal bacterial pneumonia.","Bacterial pneumonia is the most common cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by disrupted pulmonary endothelial barrier function, hyperinflammation, and impaired alveolar epithelial fluid clearance.

We previously identified CD11b as a novel alternative receptor for CD154 during alloimmunity. However, the impact of specific CD154:CD11b blockade on immune responses to infection has not been well characterized. Here, we have shown that in contrast with its immunosuppressive effect on graft-specific CD8+ T cells, CD154:CD11b blockade unexpectedly improved both the quantity and quality of murine herpesvirus-68-specific CD8+ T cells as measured by an increase in tetramer-positive KLRG1loCD127hi memory precursor effector cells. The differential effect of CD154:CD11b blockade on graft- versus virus-specific CD8+ T cells was underpinned by differences in phosphorylated S6 downstream of mTOR complex 1; however, differential expression of key transcription factors Eomes and TCF-1 was dictated by the type of antigen stimulus. These data demonstrate that priming conditions play an important role in determining the outcome of immunotherapy and suggest that specific inhibition of CD154:CD11b interactions could be effective for suppressing alloimmune responses while maintaining protective immunity to minimize infectious complications following transplantation.","CD154 is a promising target for immunosuppression in transplantation, autoimmunity, and inflammatory diseases.

10.1002/prot.26855,Structural Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike N-Terminal Domain Across Wild-Type and Recent Variants: A Comparative Study.,"Since its first appearance in China, the molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has progressed through altering the properties of the Spike protein, changing the virus ability to transmit and to evade host immune surveillance. Despite receiving less attention than the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), the Spike N-Terminal Domain (NTD) is crucial to SARS-CoV-2 biology and pathogenesis. This study provides a comparative structural analysis of the NTD from the wild-type strain and different variants (BA.2, XBB.1, XBB.1.5, BA.2.86, JN.1, HV.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.3.1.1), aiming to clarify the structural impact of mutations in each variant. To assess the impact of mutations on the interaction of NTD with antibodies, we selected as a test case the neutralizing antibody 4A8, which has proven highly effective against the WT. The results obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, surface electrostatic potential analysis, and binding energy predictions show a clear trend in the evolution of the virus. The net charge of the NTD decreases as the variants progress, reaching a minimum charge of -1.84 observed for KP.3.1.1. This is in clear contrast to the RBD net charge, which follows an opposite trend toward higher positive values. Binding energy predictions show that the antibody's efficacy decreases as the virus evolves. While the WT exhibited an interaction energy of -96.28 kcal/mol with 4A8, more recent variants like KP.3 show no interaction stronger than -64.00 kcal/mol. These results reveal a clear trend of modifications aimed at favoring immune escape in the virus' evolutionary trajectory.","Since its first appearance in China, the molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has progressed through altering the properties of the Spike protein, changing the virus ability to transmit and to evade host immune surveillance.

10.1093/gbe/evaf102,Exploiting Viral DNA Genomes to Explore the Dispersal History of African Swine Fever Genotype II Lineages in Europe.,"African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a highly virulent DNA virus that causes African swine fever, a severe hemorrhagic disease affecting domestic and wild pigs, leading to significant animal health burdens and economic losses. Initially limited to the sub-Saharan African region, ASFV genotype II has spread globally and is now a major concern in Africa, Europe, Asia, the Pacific and, more recently, the Caribbean. In this study, we performed phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses using newly sequenced ASFV genomes from Lithuania, combined with previously available complete genomes, to investigate the spatiotemporal dispersal dynamics of ASFV genotype II in Europe. Our analysis suggests that ASFV genotype II has not been recently imported to Europe from other regions; instead, the spread is largely driven by long-distance dispersal, followed by regional (within-country) circulation. The estimated dispersal metrics suggest that ASFV has a slower dispersion capacity compared to other pig-transmitted viruses and is associated with a notable degree of spatial structure. Despite these findings, significant uncertainty remains regarding certain ancestral locations, highlighting challenges related to applying phylodynamic methods to DNA viruses with low genetic variability. Nevertheless, in our study, we managed to implement a phylogeographic framework to investigate major patterns of ASFV dispersion in Europe and the contribution of international importations in the establishment of regional transmission chains. This framework could be further expanded as more genomes become available. Our study emphasizes the need for increased genomic surveillance to enlarge the ASFV genome database to support outbreak control.","African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a highly virulent DNA virus that causes African swine fever, a severe hemorrhagic disease affecting domestic and wild pigs, leading to significant animal health burdens and economic losses.

Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible beta (GADD45B) play a crucial role in stress responses; however, its precise role in HTG-AP pathogenesis remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the role of GADD45B in HTG-AP using both <i>in vitro</i> cellular and <i>in vivo</i> animal models. AR42J cells were transfected with GADD45B si-RNA or overexpressed plasmids and induced with palmitic acid (PA) and caerulein (Cae) to establish an HTG-AP cellular model. The HTG-AP animal model was successfully developed by treating mice with P-407 and Cae, alongside adeno-associated virus (AAV)-shRNA interference. The transfection efficiency was assessed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blot analyses. Furthermore, cell viability was evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and cell death rate, inflammation levels, and pyroptosis were examined using Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide (PI) staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Moreover, protein expression levels of the pyroptotic pathway, nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3/Cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific protease 1/Gasdermin D (NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD), were evaluated using Western blot analysis. The Co-IP assay confirmed the interaction between GADD45B and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3). In the AR42J cell model of HTG-AP, GADD45B interference promoted cell viability, attenuated cell death, pro-inflammation, pyroptotic cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-1β, IL-18, amylase, and intracellular vesicle counts (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, AAV-shGADD45B treatment improved pancreatic injury, cell death, and pyroptosis in HTG-AP model mice (<i>p</i> < 0.05).

This nationwide, population-based retrospective cohort study identified patients newly diagnosed with measles and SSPE between 2007 and 2022, registered in the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) and Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) databases. Population-based incidence rates of measles and SSPE were calculated and compared annually. A total of 236 measles cases (HIRA data) and 1,168 measles cases (KDCA data), along with 2,736 SSPE cases, were diagnosed during the study period. Measles incidence significantly declined, reaching zero cases in 2021, while SSPE incidence displayed an upward trend, peaking in 2014. The mean age at SSPE onset was 21.2 years, with a marked male-to-female ratio of 13.0:1. SSPE incidence was remarkably low in the post-outbreak period, likely attributable to successful measles control. This study underscores the critical importance of maintaining low measles incidence through sustained vaccination efforts, preventing SSPE and other measles-related complications.","Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare but fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by persistent measles virus infection.

10.1111/liv.70105,Myeloid Glutamine Synthetase Protects Against Acute Liver Injury in Mice Independent of Its Enzyme Activity.,"Glutamine synthetase (GS, encoded by Glul) is a well-known ammonia-detoxifying enzyme, but its function in acute liver injury (ALI) remains unclear. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and D-galactosamine (D-GalN) were utilised to construct the murine ALI model. C57BL/6J-Glul<sup>em1(flox)Smoc</sup> mice (Glul<sup>f/f</sup>) and B6.129-Lyz2<sup>tm1(cre)smoc</sup> (Lyz2-Cre) transgenic mice were crossed to generate Lyz2<sup>+</sup>Glul<sup>f/f</sup> (Glul<sup>∆Lyz2</sup>) mice with a selectively knockout of Glul in myeloid cells. Histological staining experiments were performed to evaluate liver injury. Flow cytometry and RNA sequencing analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of Glul deficiency on liver immunity. Additionally, several strategies were applied to intervene ALI in mice, including administration of CCL2 neutralising antibody or GS inhibitor L-methionine sulfoximine (MSO), as well as adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated enhancement of GS expression. The expression of Glul in myeloid cells was downregulated in wild-type mice after ALI modelling by LPS/D-GalN. Moreover, Glul<sup>∆Lyz2</sup> mice demonstrated aggravated ALI and higher mortality upon LPS/D-GalN challenge, compared to the control Glul<sup>f/f</sup> littermates. Notably, Glul deficiency significantly contributed to the activation of monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMFs), secretion of C-C chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and the recruitment of C-C chemokine receptor 2-positive monocytes. Treatment with CCL2 neutralising antibody significantly alleviated ALI by inhibiting MoMF activation. Interestingly, although MSO treatment effectively blocked the enzyme activity of GS, it exerted both preventive and therapeutic effects against ALI, which could be attributed to the elevation of GS protein level. Therefore, in vivo global or myeloid GS was overexpressed via AAV delivery system, which demonstrated potent protective efficacy against ALI. This study provided an updated look at the protective role of GS independent of its enzyme activity in ALI and shed light on the potential therapeutical strategies for ALI intervention.","Glutamine synthetase (GS, encoded by Glul) is a well-known ammonia-detoxifying enzyme, but its function in acute liver injury (ALI) remains unclear.

A national survey was conducted in Korea between June 19 and June 30, 2023. Using an anonymous online questionnaire, the survey gathered information on the general characteristics of participating hospitals, preparedness for infectious diseases in LTCHs prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, preparedness for in-house outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic, experiences of in-house COVID-19 outbreaks, and a section related to vaccines and treatments. Of the 1,425 domestic LTCHs, 201 (14.1%) completed the survey. Of the 201, before the COVID-19 pandemic, 24.9% of LTCHs had a disaster preparedness team and 27.9% had conducted training for infectious disease disaster preparedness. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 99.0% of the institutions established response teams for preparedness against COVID-19, and 89.1% of the 201 institutions experienced in-house outbreaks. Most institutions had experienced shortages of materials (78.8%), staff (96.1%), and caregivers (88.3%). The COVID-19 treatments prescribed at the LTCFs were: nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (86.6%), molnupiravir (36.8%), and remdesivir (22.4%). Independent vaccination was administered in 99% of the institutions. Despite the establishment of response systems, most LTCHs experienced in-house outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic. These institutions commonly faced challenges such as staffing shortages and supply constraints. To ensure better preparedness for future outbreaks, infection control systems should be regularly evaluated and maintained through ongoing training, even during non-outbreak periods.","This study aimed to analyze the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) response in long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and establish a preparedness and management framework for addressing novel infectious diseases.

The ketogenic diet, a high-fat, low-carbohydrate regimen, is effective in drug-resistant epilepsy, but access to affordable, culturally appropriate ketogenic products remains a challenge in developing countries. This study aims to develop the first indigenous ketogenic formula for children with drug-resistant epilepsy, using locally sourced, culturally appropriate ingredients. A ketogenic formula was developed using coconut milk powder, almond flour, soya flour, rice flakes, Bengal gram dal, and coconut oil, ensuring adaptability to ketogenic ratios (1:1 to 4:1). Organoleptic evaluation was conducted with neurologists, dietitians, parents, and children to assess taste, texture, and acceptability. Microbial safety and nutritional analysis ensured compliance with dietary requirements. The developed ketogenic formula demonstrated high acceptability across all groups, with neurologists, dietitians, parents, and children giving hedonic scores of 8.8, 8.6, 8.4, and 8.2, respectively. Microbial testing confirmed safety, with no pathogenic bacteria detected. Nutritional analysis confirmed adherence to dietary standards with an energy content 564.99 kcal, fat content 37.99 g, protein content 9.1 g, and carbohydrates 46.67 g. The developed ketogenic formula also maintained its quality and safety throughout a 6-month shelf life study without use of any preservatives. This study successfully developed a culturally appropriate, cost-effective ketogenic formula, addressing barriers to epilepsy management in resource-limited settings. Its high acceptability, safety, and adaptability suggest its potential for widespread use. Future clinical trials will assess its long-term efficacy and broader applicability.","Epilepsy affects millions of children worldwide, with 30% of cases being resistant to conventional antiseizure medications, necessitating alternative treatments.

Here it was characterised the bacterial microbiota associated with an Epichloë fungal endophyte (strain AR135) isolated from perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) via both 16S rRNA gene sequencing and direct microbial isolation and investigated the microbe-microbe interactions between these bacteria and the fungus. The bacterial microbiota of AR135 was dominated by members within the genus Paenibacillus, with 99% of abundance (on average); although bacteria within genera Delftia and Bradyrhizobium were also present. Paenibacillus cells were located on the surface of hyphae of AR135 fungus in vitro on synthetic media and in planta within perennial ryegrass leaves. Two bacterial strains, E100 and E300, identified as Paenibacillus, were isolated from the AR135 mycelium. E300 drastically altered the abundance of both the whole bacterial microbiota (increased by 63%) and E100 (reduced to 0%). None of the variations observed in the abundance of total bacterial microbiota and E100 and E300 were associated with changes in the fungal biomass of Epichloë. The findings show that Epichloë fungal endophytes can host bacterial communities, the structure of which was regulated by key members of the bacterial community.","Plant-associated fungi can host unique bacterial microbiota to provide multiple benefits to their fungal hosts.

Patients with vesicle or ulcer phase lesions were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (topical acyclovir four times daily for 7 days + aPDT simulation, n = 12) and the experimental group (placebo acyclovir ointment + aPDT applied once, n = 12). The primary outcome was lesion resolution time, with secondary assessments for recurrence, pain, local temperature, virus quantification via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and impact on quality of life. After 1 year, the remission and recurrence rates were similar between groups (p = 0.718 and p = 0.317, respectively), as were pain levels and temperature (p = 0.039 and 0.217). There was an increase in HSV-1 viral load in saliva, measured by qPCR, on Day 3 in the ACV group (p = 0.043). The OHIP-14 scores were similar between groups after 1 year. This study found no differences between aPDT and topical acyclovir regarding lesion resolution time, recurrence rates, pain levels, local temperature changes, and OHIP-14 scores. Both treatments showed similar efficacy in managing herpes simplex lesions over 1 year. While there was an increase in HSV-1 viral load in saliva in the acyclovir group on Day 3, this did not translate into differences in clinical outcomes between the groups.

10.1093/molbev/msaf120,Feature architecture-aware ortholog search with fDOG reveals the distribution of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes across life.,"The decomposition of plant material is a key driver of the global carbon cycle, traditionally attributed to fungi and bacteria. However, some invertebrates also possess orthologs to bacterial or fungal cellulolytic enzymes, likely acquired via horizontal gene transfer. This reticulated mode of evolution necessitates ortholog searches in large taxon sets to comprehensively map the repertoire of plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCDs) across the tree of life, a task surpassing capacities of current software. Here, we use fDOG, a novel profile-based ortholog search tool to trace 235 potential PCDs across more than 18,000 taxa. fDOG allows to start the ortholog search from a single protein sequence as a seed, it performs on par with state-of-the-art software that require the comparison of entire proteomes, and it is unique in routinely scoring protein feature architecture differences between the seed protein and its orthologs. Visualizing the presence-absence patterns of PCD orthologs using a UMAP highlights taxa where recent changes in the enzyme repertoire indicate a change in lifestyle. Three invertebrates have a particularly rich set of PCD orthologs encoded in their genome. Only few of the orthologs show differing protein feature architectures relative to the seed that suggest functional modifications. Thus, the corresponding species represent lineages within the invertebrates that may contribute to the global carbon cycle. This study shows how fDOG can be used to create a multi-scale view on the taxonomic distribution of a metabolic capacity that ranges from tree of life-wide surveys to individual feature architecture changes within a species.","The decomposition of plant material is a key driver of the global carbon cycle, traditionally attributed to fungi and bacteria.

The overactivation of Kupffer cells (KCs) is recognized as a significant cellular response in hepatic IRI. This study aimed to investigate the potential of recombinant chitinase 3-like 1 (rCHI3L1) to regulate M2 polarization of KCs and alleviate hepatic cold IRI. The differentially expressed genes in hepatic cold IRI were investigated using human liver and serum samples from liver transplantation patients. A rat hepatic cold IRI model was established and treated with adeno-associated virus 9-shChi3l1 and rCHI3L1 to evaluate changes in the degree of liver injury, inflammatory response, and the M2 polarization of KCs. Western blot, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, RNA sequencing, and coimmunoprecipitation were used to explore the potential role of rCHI3L1 in primary KCs. CHI3L1 was upregulated in human and rat donor livers after cold IRI, with KCs as the primary source. rCHI3L1 treatment alleviated hepatic IRI, as evidenced by lower serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, along with limited liver damage and apoptosis, whereas adeno-associated virus 9-shChi3l1 treatment exacerbated it. Mechanistically, rCHI3L1 promoted the M2 polarization of KCs by activating Janus kinase 1/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 via interleukin 13 receptor α 2, thereby alleviating hepatic damage and apoptosis. rCHI3L1 alleviated rat hepatic cold IRI by inducing KCs M2 polarization via activating the Janus kinase 1/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 axis, potentially providing a research basis for treating clinical hepatic IRI.","Hepatic cold ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) significantly restricts graft utilization and adversely affects the prognosis of liver transplantation recipients.

Our previous studies indicated that several avian H10N3 strains are highly pathogenic in mice and can be transmitted between mammals via respiratory droplets without prior adaptation. By analyzing the genome sequence, we found that these H10N3 viruses carry the PB2-E627V mutation, which is becoming increasingly common in several subtypes of avian influenza viruses (AIV); however, its mechanism in mammalian adaptation remains unclear. Using a reverse genetics system, we investigated the role of PB2-E627V in the adaptation of H10N3 to mammals and poultry. Our findings demonstrate that the PB2-E627V mutation is critical for the high pathogenicity of novel H10N3 in mice and its ability to be transmitted through the air among mammals. Additionally, we found that the role of PB2-627 V in promoting AIV adaptation to mammals is comparable to that of PB2-627 K. More importantly, PB2-627 V appears to be equally suited to long-term persistence in poultry. Therefore, using PB2-627 V as a novel molecular marker to assess the epidemic potential of AIV is of great significance for preventing possible influenza pandemics in the future.","Since 2021, the novel H10N3 has caused four cases of human infection in China, the most recent of which occurred in December 2024, posing a potential threat to public health.

The U.S. has adopted several harm reduction interventions at federal and state levels to combat SU-related harm. While several policy changes on the federal and state levels decriminalized interventions and further support their use, other policies limit the reach of these interventions by delaying or restricting care, leaving access to life-saving interventions inconsistent across the U.S. Federal and state policies in the U.S. that restrict access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), criminalize possession of drug paraphernalia, prevent syringe service programs and overdose prevention centers from operating, and limit prescribing of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pose significant barriers to harm reduction access and implementation. This paper aims to bridge publications and reports on current state and federal harm reduction intervention policies and discuss policy recommendations. Federally, the DEA and SAMHSA should expand certification for methadone dispensing to settings beyond dedicated opioid treatment programs and non-OTP prescribers. Congress can decriminalize items currently categorized as paraphernalia, permit purchasing of syringes and all drug checking equipment using federal funds, amend the Controlled Substances Act to allow for expansion of overdose prevention centers, protect Medicaid coverage of PrEP, and expand Medicaid to cover residential SU treatment. At the state level, states can reduce regulations for prescribing MOUD and PrEP, decriminalize drug paraphernalia, codify Good Samaritan laws, and remove restrictions for syringe service program and overdose prevention center implementation. Lastly, states should expand Medicaid to allow broader access to treatment for SU and oppose Medicaid lock-outs based on current SU.

This infection sequence is plausible under natural conditions and warrants further study, especially given that influenza A virus has been shown in mice to impair alveolar macrophages, which are the target cells for PRRSV. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of swIAV infection on the alveolar macrophage population, clinical signs, immune responses, and viral loads during a secondary infection with PRRSV initiated 7 days after the initial swIAV exposure. Results demonstrated that primary swIAV infection did not exacerbate the clinical progression of PRRSV infection, nor did it result in significant differences in PRRSV loads or affect the alveolar macrophage population in the lungs of super-infected pigs as compared to those of pigs infected with PRRSV alone. However, swIAV pre-infection was associated with an increase in the number of conventional dendritic cells type 1 (cDC1), perforin-expressing T cells and NK-related lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage. This coincided with an increase of PRRSV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells in blood detected 7 days post-PRRSV infection. These findings suggest that a swIAV infection could enhance immune responses during subsequent PRRSV infection by recruiting cDC1 and inducing IL-12, promoting a type-1 immune response, highlighting the complex interplay and often unexpected outcomes of viral co-infections occurring in close temporal proximity.","Farmed pigs are frequently exposed to respiratory infections, with swine influenza A virus (swIAV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) being key drivers.

10.1186/s13028-025-00814-9,Abscence of specific humoral response in three dogs with clinical leishmaniosis.,"Canine leishmaniosis, caused by Leishmania infantum, is a vector-borne disease. The immune response in infected dogs determines the clinical outcome, with a strong cell-mediated immune response linked to parasite control and mild clinical signs, while a humoral-dominant response is associated with severe disease. Low antibody levels in clinically asymptomatic dogs with negative molecular and/or parasitological test results may reflect prior exposure or the early stages of Leishmania infection. In contrast, elevated antibody levels are typically correlated with a high parasitic burden and active disease. The detection of dogs with clinical leishmaniosis and null-specific immune response against L. infantum is uncommon. However, this presentation has also been described in human leishmaniasis with the absence of humoral response detected by conventional serological methods. Case 1, a 9-year-old Border Collie, showed splenomegaly and Leishmania amastigotes within splenic macrophages. Case 2, a 10-month-old French Bulldog, had chronic anorexia and malabsorption syndrome with granulomatous splenitis and amastigotes confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Finally, case 3, a 7-year-old cross-breed, presented with cutaneous nodules and nasal ulcerative dermatitis, with Leishmania amastigotes detected histologically and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. All dogs were seronegative by two quantitative serological tests including indirect immunofluorescent test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The identification of the parasite in the affected organ established a clear cause-and-effect relationship. Consequently, anti-Leishmania treatment was initiated, consisting of allopurinol (10 mg/kg orally twice daily) and meglumine antimoniate (50 mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily for four weeks) in cases 1 and 3. In case 1, a favourable clinical response was noted, with a normal abdominal ultrasound and a negative result by quantitative molecular test from material obtained via ultrasound-guided splenic puncture. In case 3, the administration of meglumine antimoniate resulted in the resolution of dermatological signs. Clinical follow-up and anti-Leishmania treatment could not be performed for case 2. These findings highlight the diagnostic challenges in detecting clinical leishmaniosis in seronegative dogs. The absence of a specific humoral response should be considered, emphasizing the importance of using multiple diagnostic methods, including cytology, and histopathology with immunohistochemistry. This case series underscores the need for a comprehensive approach in diagnosing and managing canine leishmaniosis.","Canine leishmaniosis, caused by Leishmania infantum, is a vector-borne disease.

We compared the expected health and economic effects of the currently used bivalent vaccine, targeting HPV-16/18, and the nonavalent vaccine, targeting seven additional genotypes, for the Netherlands. We estimated the incremental impact of nonavalent versus bivalent vaccination in a cohort of 100,000 girls and 100,000 boys offered vaccination at age 10, by projecting type-specific infection risk reductions onto expected number of cervical screening outcomes, HPV-related cancers, and treatments for anogenital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP). In the base-case, we assumed two-dose vaccination with 60% uptake, lifelong partial cross-protection against HPV-31/33/45 for the bivalent vaccine and EUR 25 extra cost per dose for the nonavalent vaccine. Cost-effectiveness was assessed from a healthcare provider perspective by comparing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per life-year gained (LYG) with the Dutch threshold of EUR 20,000/LYG. Compared with bivalent vaccination, nonavalent vaccination prevents an additional 1320 high-grade cervical lesions, 70 cancers, 34,000 anogenital warts episodes and 30 RRPs and generates EUR 4.1 million discounted savings from fewer treatments. The ICER is EUR 5489 (95% credible interval: 3765; 7019)/LYG in the base-case and exceeds the cost-effectiveness threshold only if the cross-protection for the bivalent vaccine extends permanently to non-31/33/45 genotypes or if the vaccine efficacy wanes past age 20 for both vaccines. Sex-neutral vaccination with the nonavalent vaccine is likely to be cost-effective. Long-term monitoring of type-specific vaccine effectiveness is essential because of the impact of cross-protection and waning efficacy on cost-effectiveness.","Most European countries offer human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination through organised immunisation programmes, but the choice of vaccine varies.

One member of the genus, Aeromonas schubertii, is an emerging pathogen in aquaculture, causing high mortality in snakehead fish. Infections are associated with the formation of white nodules in the internal organs, likely resulting from A. schubertii-induced apoptosis and/or necrosis. The present study investigates the type strain A. schubertii ATCC 43700, which encodes two distinct T3SSs located within Aeromonas pathogenicity islands 1 and 2, referred here to as API1 and API2. We analyzed their role in A. schubertii-induced cytotoxicity and identified novel T3SS effector proteins. Infections of HeLa cells revealed that API1, but not API2, mediates cytotoxicity and induces both apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Moreover, proteomic analysis identified seven candidate effectors secreted by the API1 injectisome. These included two previously described effectors, AopH and AopO from A. salmonicida, as well as five novel effectors named AopI, AopJ, AopL, AopT, and AopU, whose injection into host cells was validated using a split luciferase reporter system. Functional characterization showed that AopL, a homolog of Vibrio parahaemolyticus VopQ, induces caspase-3/-7-independent necrosis, while AopI, a homolog of ExoY from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suppresses caspase-3/-7 activation and necrosis, revealing a pro-survival function. These results demonstrate the critical role of the API1 injectisome in A. schubertii-induced cytotoxicity and provide experimental identification of novel Aeromonas effectors that cooperate to fine-tune host cell cytotoxicity.","The type III secretion system (T3SS) is an important virulence factor of Gram-negative bacteria, including the genus Aeromonas, which represents a diverse group of aquatic bacteria.

STI complaints are treated syndromically, but post-treatment symptom resolution (SR) data are lacking in this group. This study estimated the time from treatment to symptom resolution (TTR) and examined associations with sociodemographic and behavioral factors and TTR. 250 men with UDS were recruited at health centers in Kampala, Uganda. Participants underwent point-of-care testing for HIV/syphilis, and urogenital samples were retrospectively analyzed for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Mycoplamsa genitalium (MG), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) using Aptima nucleic acid amplification tests (Hologic Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA). Socio-behavioral data were collected by questionnaire. Participants received follow-up calls at 14-, and 21-days post-enrollment to assess SR, antibiotic adherence, and sexual behaviors. Differences between participants by SR at day 14 were determined by Fisher Exact test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Chi-squared test, and Welch's t-test as appropriate. Univariable and multivariable accelerated failure time (AFT) models were used to identify associations between participant factors and TTR. Of 239 (95.6%) participants who completed day 14 follow-up surveys, 37 (16%) did not have SR by 14-days post-enrollment and treatment initiation. Median (IQR) TTR was 4.0 (3.0,6.0) days. Delayed TTR was associated with previous episodes of UDS in the prior six months (2.0 vs. 1.4, p = 0.010) and negative tests for CT/NG/MG/TV (35% vs. 15%, p = 0.004). These relationships held true when controlling for potential confounders including prior antimicrobial use, possible reinfection following sexual exposures post-enrollment, treatment non-adherence, HIV status, and other behaviors associated with increased vulnerabilities to STIs. Delayed TTR was associated with prior UDS episodes. Negative tests for common curable STIs were associated with delayed TTR suggesting the possible role of other infectious or non-infectious etiologies. The underlying mechanisms of delayed SR, e.g., reinfection, treatment failure, or dysregulated mucosal immunity, warrant further exploration.","Ugandan men with urethral discharge syndrome (UDS) have high burdens of curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV.

To address these bottlenecks, we developed an ingenious PEG-engineering strategy on the second near-infrared (NIR-II) donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) emissive dye (CCNU1020) to adjust the self-assembly nanosizes of NIR-II fluorescence probes, resulting in three variants: SYH1 (170 nm), SYH2 (80 nm), and SYH3 (60 nm). As the polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain length increased, the probes' nanosize decreased from 170 to 60 nm. Among them, SYH3 exhibited the fastest entry velocity into Epipremnum Aureum leaf and spread over the leaf veins evenly than the other two probes, of which SYH1 even could hardly entry into the leaf. Meanwhile, SYH3 demonstrated high-contrast imaging of leaf vein with an exceptional signal to background ratio (SBR, ~ 18.6) superior to that of classical NIR-I indocyanine green (ICG) (~ 3.0) and SYH2. This promising imaging ability of leaf veins achieved by size optimization laid the foundation for the early diagnosis of viral infections.

Of the 30 patients, 18 (60.0%) were infected with CMV and 6 (20.0%) with EBV. Among them, 17 cases received rabbit anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin (r-ATG) treatment (r-ATG group), 13 cases received porcine anti-human lymphocyte immunoglobulin (p-ALG) treatment (p-ALG group). The CMV infection rate was significantly higher in the r-ATG group than in the p-ALG group (15/17 vs. 3/13, <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>=13.03, <i>P</i><0.001); meanwhile, the rate of EBV infection was only slightly higher in the r-ATG group than in the p-ALG group, and the difference did not reach statistical significance (5/17 vs. 1/13, <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>=2.17, <i>P</i>=0.196).

In this study, Escherichia coli (E.coli) filled with gas vesicles is modified with drugs-loaded liposomes via amide condensation to achieve synergistic sono-chemotherapy. In this study, to regulate intelligent microbots for high-performance tumor therapy, a whirlwind-focused acoustic vortex (FAV) is used, which has a larger focal region and stronger thermal and cavitation effects as compared to the conventional focused ultrasound (FUS). The large tumors receiving single FAV irradiation exhibited enhanced and uniform drug bioaccumulation throughout the entire tumor due to the full coverage and rapid and uniform heating characteristics of FAV irradiation. The FAV-regulated intelligent microbots caused more serious DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), activated the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway to release immune cytokines, and induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) for innate immunity activation. The activated systemic immunity is further boosted by combining FAV-regulated sono-chemotherapy with immune checkpoint blockades to increase the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, decrease the population of immunosuppressive cells, and finally reshape the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This study provides a synergistic strategy via regulating intelligent microbots for large tumor immunotherapy.","Engineered bacteria as intelligent microbots preferentially targeting and colonizing tumors have overcome the poor delivery efficacy of nanomedicines toward large hypoxic tumors.

A retrospective study was conducted on children under 24 months who presented with UTI to three university hospitals in Korea between 2010 and 2023. Children diagnosed with UTI and/or acute pyelonephritis with gram-negative bacteria identified in urine cultures were included. Antibiotic susceptibility data of antibiotics commonly used to treat pediatric UTI were collected, focusing on third-generation cephalosporins. Trends in resistance were analyzed according to age group, causative organism, and the presence of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract. A total of 10,029 children were included, with a mean age of 4.0 months (IQR, 2.3-6.6 months); 67.9 % were male, and Escherichia coli accounted for 84 % of isolates. Resistance to cefotaxime increased significantly from around 10 % in the early 2010s to over 30 % after 2020. This increasing trend was consistent regardless of age group, causative organism, or presence of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, although it showed a decreasing trend after 2021. There has been a significant rise in resistance to third-generation cephalosporins among young children with UTI in Korea over the past decade.

The superfamily of ankyrin repeat proteins (N-Ank protein) was reported to be involved in autophagy regulation and cardiac protection. Bioinformatics analysis was performed (GSE61592 and GSE160516) and ten N-Ank proteins were differentially expressed in I/R models. Retinoic acid-induced protein 14 (RAI14), a member of N-Ank protein family, was upregulated in I/R-injured cardiac tissue and was first selected for research. A mouse I/R model was established by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery to induce 90 min of ischemia, followed by 72 h of reperfusion. RAI14 was found upregulated in ischemic penumbra. RAI14 overexpression in cardiac tissue by injecting adeno-associated virus-9-RAI14 plasmid system via tail vein improved cardiac function and reduced infarct and apoptosis. Furthermore, the activated autophagy in ischemic penumbra of I/R mice was reversed by RAI14 overexpression along with decreased LC3-II and increased p62 expressions. RAI14 silence showed an opposite effect. A cell model was established by using mouse cardiomyocytes HL-1 underwent hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) treatment. Similarly, H/R also enhanced RAI14 expression and RAI14 overexpression inhibited H/R-induced apoptosis and autophagy in HL-1 cells. Mechanistically, autophagy inhibitor, the AKT/mTOR pathway, was found to be suppressed in mouse and cell models whereas RAI14 overexpression activated this pathway.

However, whether the adaptive process that fosters chemotherapy resistance influences the efficacy of OV therapy is unknown. We analyzed chemo-resistant colorectal cancer (CRC) using in vitro, in vivo, and patient-derived organoid models to assess sensitivity to OVs. Through RNA sequencing analysis and immunohistochemistry were performed in clinical samples that indicated TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) expression. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and in vivo neutralization assays to demonstrate that the combination of TBK1 inhibitor (TBK1i) and OVs reprograms the tumor immune microenvironment, particularly by activating natural killer (NK) cells. Through RNA sequencing analysis, we identified intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as a potential target responsible for NK cell activation. Subsequently, we designed and conducted rescue experiments, both in vitro and in vivo, to validate the influence of ICAM-1 on NK cell activity. We demonstrated that chemo-resistant CRC showed decreased sensitivity to the OV in vitro, in vivo, and patient-derived organoids. Further investigation revealed aberrant activation of TBK1 in chemo-resistant CRC, which mediated the activation of the type I interferon pathway and impaired viral replication. TBK1 inhibition enhanced intratumor viral replication and direct oncolysis effect in vitro and augmented the antitumor immunity elicited by OVs in vivo. Immune cell profiles presented that OV/TBK1i combination reshaped the tumor microenvironment and especially activated the NK cell response.

We evaluated SKV-012's safety and efficacy in preclinical models. In a phase I trial, patients with advanced solid tumors received intratumoral injections of escalating doses of SKV-012. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, while secondary endpoints were antitumor response and changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME), assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria and multiplex immunohistochemistry and single-cell transcriptome analysis.

While inflammation-induced leakage of host proteins is a known phenomenon in CD, how these proteins affect the gut microbiota and contribute to dysbiosis remains unclear. One hypothesis is that commensal bacteria hijack these proteins, exacerbating inflammation in CD. To investigate host-microbiota interactions in CD, we measured fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2) levels in patients with CD and in mouse models of dextran sulfate sodium induced enteritis and interleukin 10 knockout spontaneous enteritis. Proteomic approaches, including bacterial pull-down and mass spectrometry, were employed to identify commensal targets of FABP2. Functional studies were conducted using wild type and <i>EF3041</i>-deficient <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> strains, along with α-FABP2 antibody treatment, to assess their effects on intestinal inflammation and microbiota composition. FABP2 levels were elevated in plasma and faeces of patients with CD, as well as in the mouse models.

BNMS is fermented by the gut microbiota to produce large amounts of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly butyrate, which are beneficial for intestinal health. However, the effects of BNMS on gut microbiota and metabolites, and its advantages over exogenous butyrate and RS, are unclear. The specific effects of BNMS were investigated via in vitro fermentation using sodium butyrate (SB) and high-amylose maize starch (HAMS) as controls. Compared to SB and HAMS, BNMS enhanced gas production, lowered pH, and produced numerous SCFAs. Additionally, BNMS effectively stimulated beneficial bacteria proliferation, including Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium, Megamonas, Collinsella, Blautia, and Bifidobacterium, and suppressed harmful bacteria proliferation, including Escherichia-shigella and Desulfovibrio, resulting in a healthier colony structure. Similarly, BNMS modulated many amino acids, neurotransmitters, vitamins, sphingolipids, carbohydrates, hormones levels, and multiple metabolic pathways, including arginine and proline metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, synaptic vesicle cycle, sphingolipid metabolism, riboflavin metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Overall, BNMS positively affected gut microbiota and metabolites, exhibiting advantages over exogenous butyrate and RS.

Similarly, BNMS modulated many amino acids, neurotransmitters, vitamins, sphingolipids, carbohydrates, hormones levels, and multiple metabolic pathways, including arginine and proline metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, synaptic vesicle cycle, sphingolipid metabolism, riboflavin metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Overall, BNMS positively affected gut microbiota and metabolites, exhibiting advantages over exogenous butyrate and RS. These results provide some theoretical basis for the BNMS development and application as a functional food.",PubMed
10.1016/j.carbpol.2025.123790,Enhanced antifungal activity of chitosan-coated cinnamaldehyde-immobilized thermostable cellulose from spent mushroom substrate against phytopathogenic fungi.,"Phytopathogenic fungi jeopardize global food security, fueling reliance on synthetic fungicides with severe ecological impacts. Avoiding these chemicals risks a food crisis, highlighting the need for sustainable alternatives. Cinnamaldehyde (CA) is a natural but chemically unstable fungicide, hence requiring stabilization through effective immobilization. This study presents a biodegradable and sustainable alternative to synthetic anchoring materials: spent-mushroom-substrate-derived cellulose. CA immobilized cellulose was coated with chitosan which further enhanced the antifungal potential and contributed to slow release of CA. Cellulose extraction and CA encapsulation were successfully confirmed through analytical characterization. The resulting product (CeCACs) proved a promising fungicide, inhibiting key phytopathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus niger at 46. 8 μg/mL and Fusarium solani at 93.7 μg/mL concentration. The obtained minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values were significantly lower than commercial fungicide, tebuconazole (TB). The fungicidal mechanism involved reactive oxygen species accumulation, plasma membrane damage, and apoptosis-like cell death. Using CeCACs as a peanut seed coating enhanced seedling growth and enriched beneficial endophytic bacteria, while CeCACs fumigation effectively eradicated Fusarium oxysporum from peanut and passion fruit surfaces. This study emphasizes converting agri-waste into a green fungicide, supporting sustainable and regenerative agriculture.","Phytopathogenic fungi jeopardize global food security, fueling reliance on synthetic fungicides with severe ecological impacts.

The unique properties of dextrans, their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and non-immunogenicity support a wide range of medical and industrial applications. Key characteristics of dextran, including solubility, viscosity, and molecular weight, highly depend on the bacterial strain and the conditions under which it is synthesized. The structural diversity within the family of dextran-synthesizing enzymes contributes to dextran diversity. Conventionally, dextran with low molecular weight is obtained by fermentative production of high molecular weight dextran, followed by partial hydrolysis and a precise fractionation procedure, which is a costly and hazardous process. However, recent advances in enzyme- and bioprocess engineering in combination with analytical techniques have significantly enhanced the ability to control the molecular weight and branching patterns of dextran. Thereby improving its effectiveness and broadening its applications in both industrial and clinical settings. This review focuses on the production of dextrans with defined molecular weight and the enzymatic mechanisms underlying their synthesis, which have been increasingly studied in recent years. In particular, clinical-type dextran with a molecular weight of 70 kDa is of high commercial value and scientific interest.","Dextrans are α-(1 → 6)-linked, mostly branched α-d-glucopyranosyl polysaccharides synthesized from sucrose by lactic acid bacteria.

Structural analysis revealed that RAP-3 A, with a molecular weight of 51.03 kDa, is primarily composed of a backbone of 1, 4-galacturonic acid glycan, incorporating a 1, 4-linked α-GalpA and 1, 2-linked α-Rhap disaccharide repeating unit, with branches at C-4 of the Rhap residue comprising 1, 4-linked β-Galp, 1, 6-linked β-Galp, or 1, 5-linked α-Araf. Remarkably, RAP-3 A significantly alleviated colitis symptoms in mice, including weight loss, disease activity index (DAI), and histopathological damage. Mechanistically, RAP-3 A inhibited the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, enhanced intestinal barrier function by upregulating ZO-1 and occludin, and reduced goblet cell depletion. Furthermore, RAP-3 A promoted a favorable shift in gut microbiota composition, increasing the abundance of beneficial SCFA-producing bacteria such as Bacteroidales_S24-7, Rikenellaceae, Clostridiales, Oscillospira, and Lachnospiraceae while suppressing pathogenic bacteria, notably Escherichia. GC-MS analysis further confirmed that RAP-3 A significantly increased fecal SCFAs levels.

However, the specific microbes, their metabolic interactions and mechanistic insights remain understudied. In this study, we aim to investigate the response of gut microbiota to XOS at the fine-grained level using combined approaches of microbiome sequencing, genomic analyses, and metabolomic analyses based on in vitro fecal fermentation using healthy human fecal samples. The results showed that XOS significantly altered the composition of the gut microbiota and enriched numerous bacterial taxa, such as Blautia, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Functional genomic analyses further confirmed that specifically identified XOS-responsive bacteria harbored varied XOS-utilizing capacities, consistent with the levels of their abundance elevation. The fecal metabolomics analysis revealed that XOS intervention significantly altered the metabolic profile (γ-aminobutyric acid, serotonin, and inosine). The microbe-microbe and microbe-metabolite interaction networks consistently identified three independent groups, potentially representing different levels of XOS degradation and/or other response mechanisms.

Current methods lack the capability for simultaneous identification, which hampers outbreak control in resource-limited settings and global surveillance efforts. Traditional techniques, like real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), are often impractical in resource-limited areas due to laboratory dependency, and specialized personnel requirements. A portable, rapid, and cost-effective method for multiplex field detection of highly pathogenic viruses is critically needed to address the growing threat of outbreaks in resource-limited settings. In this study, a simple and rapid nucleic acid extraction method was performed using a paper-based dipstick, which was equipment-free and could be completed within 2 min. Subsequently, a microfluidic chip was integrated with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology to develop a field-deployable, portable detection method termed the microfluidic-LAMP assay. This assay allows for the simultaneous detection of eight highly pathogenic viruses: Ebola virus (EBOV), Marburg virus (MARV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), Lassa virus (LASV), yellow fever virus (YFV), Congo Basin Mpox virus (C-MPXV), West African Mpox virus (W-MPXV), and variola virus (VARV), all within a span of 70 min. The assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 7.02 × 10<sup>2</sup>-8 × 10<sup>4</sup> copies/mL across different targets using simulated clinical samples.

The aim of this study was to investigate a novel application of L-type phenyllactate (L-PLA) in the ""three birds one stone"" control of B. gladioli growth, biofilm formation, and BA production. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of L-PLA against B. gladioli were both 2.0 mg/mL. L-PLA disrupted the integrity and structure of B. gladioli, resulting in leakage of intracellular components and reduction of cell viability. Meanwhile, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species indicated that oxidative stress was involved in the bactericidal mechanism of dissociated B. gladioli. SEM and confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) results confirmed the severe destruction of B. gladioli by L-PLA. Additionally, subinhibitory concentrations of L-PLA could effectively inhibit biofilm formation, which was achieved by a decrease in biofilm biomass and a reduction in the proportion of live and dead bacteria within the biofilm. L-PLA demonstrated a notable inhibitory effect on the motility of B. gladioli, accompanied by alterations in cell surface hydrophobicity and auto-aggregation. Furthermore, the synthesis of BA was considerably decreased when exposed to L-PLA stress for 5 d. RT-qPCR showed that the expression of genes involved in BA biosynthesis was suppressed by L-PLA. Notably, bacterial survival rate and BA production of B. gladioli in the Auricularia auricula soaking solution was significantly inhibited with L-PLA (1/2 × -2 × MIC), and did not affect sensory acceptability.

The research involved the determination of the individual, 2 × 2 combined, and combined minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of fumaric acid, pH, and ethanol. Specifically, the MIC90 was defined as the concentration required to inhibit the growth of more than 90 % of the initial population, and the MIC50 was defined as the concentration required to inhibit the growth of more than 50 % of the initial population. These thresholds were assessed in 19 bacterial strains (13 LAB and 6 AAB strains) at pH values of 3.5 and 4.0 and ethanol concentrations of 0, 4, 8 and 12 % v/v. Additionally, the impact of FA on biofilm formation was evaluated in the ten bacterial strains that were observed to be most resistant to FA. The results revealed that the inhibitory effects of FA were enhanced at lower pH values and at higher ethanol concentrations. LAB strains (such as Oenococcus oeni) were particularly sensitive to FA, whereas non-Oenococcus LAB strains demonstrated resistance to concentrations exceeding 2 g/L under the tested pH (3.5-4.0) and ethanol (0-12 % v/v) conditions.

Since cantaloupes grow on the ground, direct soil contact represents a potential consumer risk if the rinds become contaminated with foodborne pathogens. Therefore, this study evaluated the impact of netting density on the efficacy of antimicrobial washes, including sodium hypochlorite (FAC; 200 mg/L free available chlorine), peracetic acid (PAA; 80 mg/L), chlorine dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>; 5 mg/L), and distilled water (control), in reducing foodborne pathogenic bacteria from cantaloupe rind surfaces. The three cantaloupe varieties with different rind characteristics (smooth-, medium-, and heavy-netted cantaloupes) were inoculated with a mixed culture containing pathogenic strains of Salmonella Typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, and E. coli O157:H7. Results showed that increased netting density decreased the sanitizers' efficacy in reducing foodborne pathogenic bacteria. Specifically, bacterial reduction was highest in the smooth-rind variety when treated with peracetic acid and sodium hypochlorite. While chlorine dioxide contributed to the reduction of the load of pathogenic bacteria, its efficacy was significantly lower than the obtained by PAA and FAC treatments.

Lactobacillus delbrueckii CTR1 exhibited the highest acidification potential (ΔpH 1.00). Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus JLR3 displayed strong antimicrobial activity, particularly against Salmonella Enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus, while Enterococcus faecium ITR5 was effective against Escherichia coli.

Whole genomes of both parental strains and the sequencing of the rib clusters of the riboflavin-overproducing ones were conducted. Punctual mutations affecting different stem-loops in the aptamer region of the FMN-riboswitch involved in the regulation of the rib expression were detected. Riboflavin overproduction of the derivative strains was confirmed through HPLC quantification in RAMc and MRSc cultures, ranging from 64.9 to 441.2 μg/L. These levels correlated to predicted secondary folding and stability of the aptamer region and/or expression platform of the rib FMN riboswitch.

These levels correlated to predicted secondary folding and stability of the aptamer region and/or expression platform of the rib FMN riboswitch. Safety and technological properties of the riboflavin-overproducing derivatives, in terms of antibiotic resistance profile and carbohydrate utilization capabilities, were not altered following roseoflavin exposure, thus confirming the potential aptitude of the riboflavin-overproducing derivatives to produce biofortified foods such as those formulated on dairy matrixes.",PubMed

Organic acid processing aids are commonly used to decrease pathogenic loads on raw beef, but knowledge of their efficacy against common spoilage bacteria is limited. Beef chuck rolls (IMPS 116A, N = 24) were obtained from two different processing facilities in Nebraska and treated with either 4.5 % lactic acid, 2.5 % Beefxide®, or 380 ppm peroxyacetic acid alongside a no-treatment control. Samples were stored at 2.7 °C for 112 days. Every 28 days, samples were evaluated using aerobic, anaerobic, psychrotrophic, lactic acid bacteria, and Pseudomonas plate counts and using amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Significant differences (P < 0.05) between groups were determined using DeSeq2. Lactococcus became the most abundant genus on day 28 and every subsequent sampling point regardless of treatment group. Pseudomonas and Yersinia were also present at perceptible levels and were identified to be higher in control samples compared to lactic acid treated samples through differential abundance analysis. Concentrations of culturable bacteria increased during storage across all plating methods (P < 0.05), but treatment differences were minimal. Overall, these treatments had impact on the bacterial diversity during storage. When considering the use of processing aids to limit spoilage, the treatment should be chosen based on a targeted specific spoilage organism.","Limiting bacterial spoilage and thereby protecting the economic value of raw beef destined for export is a top priority of the United States beef industry.

10.1016/j.fm.2025.104818,AHLs-driven quorum sensing modulates competitive interspecies interactions in synthetic biofilms community among fish spoilage bacteria.,"Food spoilage microorganisms often reside in dense mixed-species biofilms mediated by quorum sensing (QS). However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying interspecific interactions within spoilage microecosystems remain poorly understood. In this study, an experimental mixed-species biofilms model consisting of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Shewanella baltica, and Acinetobacter johnsonii was established to examine interspecies interactions at different temperatures and to explore regulatory role of N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones (AHLs). Genome sequencing revealed that compared to only LuxR receptor in S. baltica and A. johnsonii, P. fluorescens possesses a complete LuxI/R-type QS system and numerous genes related to biofilms formation and iron acquisition. Phenotypic results confirmed that P. fluorescens, as the dominant strain in the mixed-species biofilms, enhanced its competitiveness at low temperatures by repressing S. baltica metabolism. Meanwhile, S. baltica and A. johnsonii could eavesdrop on AHLs signaling secreted by P. fluorescens, particularly C<sub>4</sub>-HSL. C<sub>4</sub>-HSL-mediated QS modulated interspecies competition within the biofilms community and contribute to increased disinfectant resistance, likely through enhanced antioxidant capacity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that C<sub>4</sub>-HSL activated multiple genes expression involved in oxidative stress defense to mitigate intracellular ROS accumulation, including antioxidant enzyme synthesis, pyoverdine production for iron chelation and competitive advantage, and the upregulating ABC transporters and two-component systems to facilitate substance transport. Thus, these findings demonstrate that AHL-mediated interspecies communication plays a critical role in maintaining biofilms stability and provide mechanistic insights into QS-driven bacterial adaptation, offering potential strategies for targeted biofilms control.","Food spoilage microorganisms often reside in dense mixed-species biofilms mediated by quorum sensing (QS).

Here, we collected illegally imported food products that were confiscated from passengers arriving from non-EU countries at Frankfurt International Airport (FRA), Germany. A total of 100 food samples were microbiologically tested for the presence of foodborne and multiresistant pathogens and hygiene parameters were determined. For this, samples were qualitatively examined for Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-/AmpC-producing Enterobacterales. Quantitative microbiological analyses included aerobic mesophilic colony counts, L. monocytogenes, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Enterobacterales and E. coli counts. Overall, Enterobacterales and E. coli were detected in 36 % and 23 % of the samples, respectively, indicating hygiene deficiencies, while foodborne pathogens were observed in 17 % of the samples. Selected isolates were subjected to a comprehensive genotypic analysis, for which they were whole genome sequenced. It was demonstrated that the S. aureus isolates (n = 11) revealed a wide variety of genotypic profiles, with one isolate belonging to a newly assigned sequence type ST8323. Three S. aureus isolates were classified as multiresistant, including one MRSA. The Salmonella enterica isolates (n = 3) belonged to three serovars (Uganda, Altona, Rauform) and were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested. Further, no resistance was detected in the obtained L. monocytogenes isolates (n = 3; ST8, ST121, ST425). In three of the 23 presumed commensal E. coli isolates multiresistance was observed, whereas the single STEC isolate (O43:H2) was susceptible. In addition, we obtained five ESBL-producing Enterobacterales isolates, of which one isolate carried a rarely described bla<sub>SHV-168</sub> subtype. Overall, the data show that illegal imports in the baggage of airline passengers can facilitate the spread of zoonotic and multiresistant bacterial isolates, including those resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones. This contributes to the transmission of newly described or uncommon lineages.","Illegal imports of food of animal origin from third countries into the EU are a potential transmission route for zoonotic and multiresistant bacterial pathogens.

However, the direction of these changes and the underlying mechanisms driving them, particularly in crops adapting to the field conditions, are not well understood. Here, we investigate the root endosphere microbiome of rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) across four consecutive cultivation seasons in a high-yield, non-fertilized, and pesticide-free paddy field, compared to a neighboring fertilized and pesticide-treated field. Using 16S rRNA amplicon and metagenome sequencing, we analyzed three Japonica cultivars-Nipponbare, Hinohikari, and Kinmaze. Our findings reveal that the root endosphere microbiomes diverge based on fertilization regime and plant developmental stages, while the effects of cultivar variation are less significant. Machine learning model and metagenomic analysis of nitrogenase (nif) genes suggest enhanced nitrogen fixation activity in the non-fertilized field-grown roots, highlighting a potential role of diazotrophic, iron-reducing bacteria Telmatospirillum. These results provide valuable insights into the assembly of the rice root microbiome in nutrient-poor soil, which can aid in managing microbial homeostasis for sustainable agriculture.","Plants accommodate diverse microbial communities, termed the microbiome, which can change dynamically during plant adaptation to varying environmental conditions.

10.1016/j.jbc.2025.110345,Identification and characterization of mono- and bifunctional galactan synthases in the pediatric pathogen Kingella kingae.,"The emerging pediatric pathogen Kingella kingae elaborates a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is extended with a galactofuranose homopolymer called galactan, which is a key virulence determinant that contributes to resistance to complement-mediated and neutrophil-mediated killing. Previous work has demonstrated that the pamABCDE locus is required for galactan synthesis. In this study, mutational studies suggested that the pamC gene product is a UDP-galactofuranose (Galf) transferase and is the galactan synthase. Analysis of genome sequence data revealed two distinct pamC alleles designated pamC1 and pamC2, which correlate with the two galactan structures in K. kingae. Examination of isogenic mutants expressing either pamC1 or pamC2 demonstrated that the pamC alleles are the determinants of galactan structure. Experiments with recombinant PamC1 and PamC2 in vitro established that these proteins are galactan synthases capable of extending synthetic Galf disaccharide acceptors in the presence of UDP-Galf. Homology analysis identified critical amino acids that are essential for PamC1 and PamC2 enzymatic activity both in vitro and in K. kingae. Structural analysis of the in vitro-modified synthetic acceptors implicated PamC1 as a monofunctional enzyme capable of generating a β-(1→5) Galf linkage and PamC2 as a bifunctional enzyme capable of generating β-(1→3) and β-(1→6) Galf linkages. This study advances our understanding of the GT2 family of UDP-galactofuranosyltransferases.","The emerging pediatric pathogen Kingella kingae elaborates a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is extended with a galactofuranose homopolymer called galactan, which is a key virulence determinant that contributes to resistance to complement-mediated and neutrophil-mediated killing.

Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV), a destructive pathogen transmitted by the white-backed planthopper (Sogatella furcifera, WBPH), severely threatens rice production, yet the mechanisms by which SRBSDV manipulates WBPH salivary secretion to enhance viral spread remain poorly understood. Here, integrated proteomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that SRBSDV infection significantly reduces salivary protein diversity and abundance in WBPH, including digestive enzymes, redox regulators, and effector proteins critical for suppressing plant defenses. LC-MS/MS-based quantification demonstrated a marked decline in secreted protein types and altered abundance profiles in SRBSDV-infected WBPH compared to SRBSDV-free counterparts. Transcriptomic profiling identified 1,803 differentially expressed genes in SRBSDV-infected salivary glands, with transmembrane transport-related pathways being prominently downregulated. Crucially, cross-omics integration revealed minimal correlation between salivary protein secretion and transcriptional changes, suggesting that SRBSDV primarily disrupts salivary function by impairing transmembrane transport capacity rather than directly suppressing protein synthesis. This secretory defect likely attenuates the insect's ability to neutralize plant defenses, driving behavioral shifts toward frequent probing that enhance viral inoculation efficiency. Our study unveils a novel strategy whereby SRBSDV hijacks vector secretory machinery to optimize transmission, advancing understanding of virus-vector coevolution and providing a foundation for effector-targeted interventions to block viral spread.","Most plant viruses rely on insect vectors for transmission, with insect saliva serving as a critical interface in tripartite virus-vector-host interactions.

This study introduces a canopy, i.e., a novel vertical airflow system with ceramic wall flow filters designed to reduce the spread of airborne pathogens in hospital environments. The system captures exhaled air above the patient, filters it via ceramic filters, and releases clean air beneath the bed. Laboratory tests were conducted in controlled environments with small (15 m<sup>2</sup>) and large (36 m<sup>2</sup>) rooms. The filtration efficiency was evaluated using nebulized salt particles, nebulized MS2 bacteriophages, and bacteria exhaled by an adult person sleeping in the bed. The performance of the system was further tested in conjunction with hospital separation curtains to assess combined effectiveness. Filtration efficiencies reached up to 95% for nebulized salt particles, 87% for nebulized MS2 bacteriophages, and 92% for bacteria exhaled by an adult person sleeping in the bed. Hospital separation curtains alone provided a modest reduction in aerosol spread; however, their performance was enhanced when used alongside the vertical airflow system. These results confirm the canopy system's potential to reduce nosocomial infections by reducing aerosol concentrations. The innovative combination of vertical airflow and robust filtration technology offers a practical solution for improving air quality and protecting patients and healthcare workers in hospitals.","Aerosol transmission of infectious diseases is of particular concern in hospital and care facilities where isolation rooms are limited, leading to capacity crises in the past, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In view of this, we aimed to investigate the heterologous interference between these arboviruses during coinfections and superinfections in a primate cell line. Experimental infections with MAYV and CHIKV were performed singly, simultaneously or consecutively, and cytopathic effect, cell viability and virus load were assessed by phase contrast light microscopy, fluorimetry and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. All infection schemes led to a strong cytopathic effect accompanied by an average reduction of almost 90% in cell viability within 24 h post-infection. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the loads of both viruses in coinfections, a decrease in the individual virus load of more than 90% when compared to their respective single infections was observed. Furthermore, superinfections resulted in widely significant differences in the amount of progeny formed for each virus, with a first-mover advantage regardless of the species. MAYV and CHIKV are subject to heterologous interference during coinfections and superinfections in primate cells, which could possibly impact disease outcome in humans.","Mayaro virus (MAYV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are arthritogenic alphaviruses with distinct natural vectors but common vertebrate hosts, whose concomitant circulation in Central and South America provides opportunities for mixed infections in humans.

Both host metabolic processes and the gut microbiota exhibit diurnal regulation, and both contribute to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis [1-3]. However, how the gut microbiota and the circadian rhythm interplay to control host glucose homeostasis is not fully understood. Here, we identified gut microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles (MEV) as a potential peripheral Zeitgeber (time cue) for the hepatic circadian clock, controlling hepatic gluconeogenesis. Host feeding patterns influence the gut microbiota, driving the diurnal production of MEV. Gut MEV levels coincide with the activity of hepatic gluconeogenesis, with overnight fasting associated with increased production of MEV by gut bacteria. MEV directly activates hepatic gluconeogenesis and chronic increase in MEV exposure impairs glucose homeostasis in vivo. Our finding highlights a mechanism by which the gut microbiota has co-evolved with the host to support its glucose needs during period of energy demands (such as during fasting or starvation). On the contrary, an abnormal increase in MEV production, leading to dysregulated gluconeogenesis, may underlie various glucose-associated disorders, such as type 2 or gestational diabetes. Together, our data reconciles the gut microbiota and circadian rhythm in the control of host glucose homeostasis and metabolic health.","The circadian clock regulates tissue-specific homeostasis, and its disruption is associated with metabolic disorders.

The present study aimed to isolate polysaccharide from Areca catechu L. (FAP1a) and to investigate its potential mechanism for ameliorating UC symptoms in a mouse model of UC. The results indicated that the molecular weight of FAP1a was approximately 65 kDa and consisted of arabinose, mannose and galactose, with the main chain probably consisting of →3,6)-β-Gal-(1 → and →2,4,6)-β-Man-(1→. FAP1a effectively attenuated weight loss and colonic tissue damage in mice. FAP1a modulated gut microbial composition by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Ligilactobacillus, Dubosiella, Ruminococcus and Lactobacillus. Meanwhile, FAP1a upregulated the expression of beneficial metabolites including L-glutamate, D-mannose, and D-tagatose mainly through the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism and galactose metabolism pathways. The above results elucidated that FAP1a could alleviate UC symptoms through modulation of the gut microbial structure and serum metabolites. These findings highlight the potential of FAP1a as a novel therapeutic agent for UC and provided insights into the potential mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects.","Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease and has emerged as a public health challenge worldwide.

The results indicated that the molecular weight of FAP1a was approximately 65 kDa and consisted of arabinose, mannose and galactose, with the main chain probably consisting of →3,6)-β-Gal-(1 → and →2,4,6)-β-Man-(1→. FAP1a effectively attenuated weight loss and colonic tissue damage in mice. FAP1a modulated gut microbial composition by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Ligilactobacillus, Dubosiella, Ruminococcus and Lactobacillus. Meanwhile, FAP1a upregulated the expression of beneficial metabolites including L-glutamate, D-mannose, and D-tagatose mainly through the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism and galactose metabolism pathways. The above results elucidated that FAP1a could alleviate UC symptoms through modulation of the gut microbial structure and serum metabolites. These findings highlight the potential of FAP1a as a novel therapeutic agent for UC and provided insights into the potential mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects.",PubMed

However, its function in fish remains poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the structural and functional features of Epinephelus akaara ISG20 (EAISG20). EAISG20 exhibited the highest degree of association with its orthologs from Epinephelus species and clustered with teleostean ISG20s in the phylogenetic tree. Under normal physiological conditions, EAISG20 mRNA was the most highly expressed in the blood. The temporal expression analysis of EAISG20 indicated significant transcriptional responses following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), and nervous necrosis virus (NNV) in the immune challenge experiment. The subcellular localization assay revealed that EAISG20 was predominantly localized in the cell nucleus. To examine its role in antiviral defense, EAISG20 was overexpressed in fish cells, and it resulted in a significant reduction in viral gene transcription and an increased cell survival following infection with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and NNV. Additionally, EAISG20 contributed substantially to apoptosis suppression by maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential during poly I:C stimulation. Overall, the present study highlighted the antiviral potential of EAISG20 against various viral stimuli, thereby providing remarkable insight into the innate immune response of ISG20 in teleosts and laying the groundwork for future research on its role in antiviral defense.","Interferon-stimulated 20-kDa exonuclease (ISG20) is a fundamental antiviral gene that plays a critical role in the vertebrate innate immune system.

Duck viral enteritis is caused by Anatid herpesvirus 1 (AnHV-1), which belongs to the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily. Despite widespread vaccination and the implementation of sophisticated disease management methods, viral propagation has yet to be controlled or avoided. However, live vaccines are always a challenge due to the latency of herpes viruses. As a result, discovering new antiviral medicines and therapy alternatives for DVE is becoming increasingly important. Piperazine is a malleable, medicinally important scaffold that serves as a critical component in several marketed medications with a variety of pharmacological properties. The piperazine was initially developed as an anti-helminthic drug, but it has been repurposed as an effective antiviral drug for some viral infections. In the present study, we evaluated the ability of piperazine to inhibit AnHV-1 replication in vitro and in embryonated chicken eggs. Our data collectively demonstrated that piperazine treatment modulated AnHV-1 replication in chicken embryonic fibroblast (CEF) cells. Furthermore, differential host gene expression was found in piperazine-treated CEF cells after 48 hours of incubation post-virus infection. Several genes, including IL-1β, NLRP3, IL18, TNFα, IFN-α, IFN-β, CH25H, and viperin, showed considerable up-regulation upon piperazine treatment in CEF cells. The data implies piperazine modulates AnHV-1 replication by regulating host innate immunity regulatory genes. The findings of the study could be elaborated upon to establish piperazine as an alternative antiviral agent against AnHV-1.","Duck virus enteritis (DVE) is an infectious and fatal disease that affects numerous species of waterfowl.

A hydroalcoholic propolis extract was fractionated to yield fractions rich in phenolic compounds. High-performance liquid chromatography identified calycosin as a chemical marker, along with liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin, and formononetin. The propolis extract and the chloroform fraction inhibited Staphylococcus aureus growth with a bactericidal effect, while for Escherichia coli, a bacteriostatic effect was observed at concentrations below 1000µg/mL. The AgNPs were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, confirming surface plasmon resonance, and their morphology and size were analyzed using dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy, with elemental composition assessed via energy-dispersive spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction and selected area electron diffraction showed the crystalline structure. Fourier-transform infrared spectra indicated that carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in flavonoids reduce silver ions and contribute to the nanoparticles' chemical stability. The nanoparticles synthesized from the propolis extract showed enhanced antibacterial potential, with efficacy against E. coli (MIC 25µg/mL, MBC 50µg/mL) compared to S. aureus (MIC 100µg/mL, MBC 100µg/mL), and demonstrated selectivity for Gram-negative bacteria over murine macrophages (CC<sub>50</sub> 83.92μg/mL). These nanoparticles exhibited maximum absorption in the UV-Vis region at 418nm, with a spherical silver core encapsulated by compounds from propolis, hydrodynamic diameter of 252.47 ± 1.42nm, a zeta potential of -51.80 ± 0.70mV, and a polydispersity index of 0.218 ± 0.01, indicating high chemical stability. These findings underscore Amazon red propolis as a sustainable resource for developing selective and stable antibacterial agents.","This study investigates the use of Amazon red propolis for the green synthesis of antibacterial silver nanoparticles (AgNPs).

Gallium arsenide (GaAs) nanowire photodetectors have attracted wildly attentions due to their direct band gap, specific surface area and high optical absorption coefficient. However, GaAs nanowires suffer the problem of serious surface states, leading to the development of high performance GaAs nanowire photodetectors. Plasma treatment with inert gas is one of the important methods to reduce the density of surface states. In this paper, the effect of nitrogen plasma treatment on the performance of GaAs nanowire photodetector is investigated. The results show that the light current of GaAs nanowire photodetector is obviously increased. Besides, the responsivity, specific detectivity and external quantum efficiency are also improved.

10.1016/j.jhazmat.2025.138851,Polyurethane wastes conversion into a plant biostimulant via ozonolytic attack: An innovative strategy for waste management and sustainable agriculture.,"A novel, non-toxic plant biostimulant has been developed through the depolymerization of polyurethane (PU) foams via an aqueous ozonolysis process. This method yields a water-based extract rich in small, soluble molecules, referred to as oxidized liquid extract (OLE), which acts as a growth-promoting substrate for pepper plants (Capsicum annuum). This approach not only enables the conversion of PU waste into plant biomass but also represents an innovative model for circular economy implementation. When applied at low concentrations (diluted 1:5 and 1:10), OLE elicits a hormetic response, enhancing photosynthetic performance, protein content, and photosynthetic pigment levels. Additionally, it stimulates the accumulation of industrially relevant secondary metabolites such as terpenoids and capsaicinoids an effect likely linked to the extract's high nitrate content. Although short-chain polyols were detected in the fruits of plants treated with the 1:5 dilution, these compounds are biodegradable and widely used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. Moreover, OLE induces favorable shifts in rhizospheric microbial communities, promoting the enrichment of biofertilizing bacterial genera capable of transforming extract derived compounds and enhancing the adsorption of biomolecules secreted by plant roots. This sequential chemical and biological transformation facilitates the complete valorization of a highly recalcitrant polymeric waste, resulting in a bioactive extract that supports plant growth and development. Taken together, this strategy offers a promising and sustainable solution that integrates waste management with agricultural productivity, aligning with the core principles of the circular bioeconomy.","A novel, non-toxic plant biostimulant has been developed through the depolymerization of polyurethane (PU) foams via an aqueous ozonolysis process.

Here, we investigated the effects of 6PPD and 6PPDQ on the gut-liver axis in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Zebrafish larvae exposed to 0.01, 1, and 100 μg/L of 6PPD or 6PPDQ for five days exhibited intestinal and hepatic developmental toxicity, including hepatic lipid accumulation and hepatomegaly. Adult zebrafish exposed for 21 days displayed compromised intestinal barrier integrity, gut dysbiosis, and lipidomic disturbances in the liver. Statistical analysis using the multi-response permutation procedure confirmed significant shifts in gut microbial community structure. Dysbiosis was characterized by reduced beneficial bacteria and an increase in pathogenic taxa, accompanied by elevated circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and upregulated hepatic expression of lbp (LPS-binding receptor). Hepatic lipid accumulation resulted from increased triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol synthesis, with lipidomics revealing distinct disruptions: 6PPD impaired phosphatidylinositol phosphate synthesis, while 6PPDQ affected TG homeostasis. Correlation analysis linked gut microbial shifts to hepatic lipid dysregulation. These findings suggest that 6PPD and 6PPDQ exposure disrupts gut-liver axis homeostasis, potentially driving non-alcoholic fatty liver disease development.

10.1016/j.redox.2025.103699,Nitric Oxide restricts iron availability and induces quorum sensing in Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical signaling molecule with multiple biological functions. As part of the innate immune system, NO has antimicrobial properties playing an important role in host defense. Mechanisms of NO cytotoxicity result from its ability to bind metals and inhibit enzyme function or by increasing nitrosative and oxidative stress within cells. One of the primary biological targets of NO is the chelatable iron pool (CIP) which is quantitatively converted to dinitrosyliron complexes (DNIC) when it reacts with NO. Despite the numerous purported mechanisms attributed to NO's bactericidal properties, DNIC formation and its ability to restrict iron bioavailability from pathogenic bacteria has not been directly tested. Streptococcus pyogenes is a human pathogen that causes a range of diseases spanning from pharyngitis and impetigo to soft tissue necrosis and toxic shock. S. pyogenes employs the Rgg2/Rgg3 quorum sensing (QS) system to regulate aspects of its virulence potential, including biofilm formation, lysozyme resistance, and modulation of host innate immune response. Previous studies found that iron and manganese restriction induced Rgg2/Rgg3 QS, leading us to test whether NO-dependent iron restriction mediated by DNIC formation was sufficient to induce QS and related iron-starvation phenotypes. Here, we demonstrate that DNIC are formed in S. pyogenes exposed to physiologically relevant NO concentrations. The DNIC are formed from the CIP, and formation led to a significant reduction in the CIP, which correlated to a concomitant activation of QS and iron-regulated gene expression. These studies are the first to demonstrate that restriction of iron bioavailability mediated by DNIC formation is a functional mechanism by which NO can regulate QS, gene expression, and cell growth in bacteria.","Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical signaling molecule with multiple biological functions.

Therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility of using saliva in DENV-1 detection. RT-qPCR was performed to detect DENV-1 in 201 paired saliva and plasma samples, from individuals with up to five days from the onset of symptoms. 140 (69.65 %) patients had DENV-1 positive detection in plasma and 115 (57.21 %) positive in saliva samples. Those values rendered a sensitivity of 82.14 % and 100 % of specificity (agreement kappa index 0.736 [0.69 - 0.77]. Despite reduced sensitivity, we demonstrated the feasibility of DENV-1 diagnosis in saliva samples, presenting a valuable alternative, particularly in outbreak scenario.",PubMed

10.1016/j.mib.2025.102616,"Cell cycle regulation in Escherichia coli: from governing principles, checkpoints, and control variables to molecular mechanisms.","All cells share the basic challenge of integrating the various processes that ensure their faithful replication. In most bacteria, this occurs without the dedicated regulatory machinery and additional layers of internal organization seen in eukaryotic cells. Despite this apparent reduction in complexity, bacterial replication is remarkably faithful and can be exceptionally fast. While spatiotemporal regulation of cell cycle processes is crucial for such efficient and reliable proliferation, many aspects of this currently remain elusive in bacteria. In this review, we focus on the cell cycle regulation of Escherichia coli, one of the best-studied bacterial models. We highlight how large-scale quantitative phenomenological studies have leveraged cellular variability to identify governing principles of cell cycle control in recent years. We discuss how these principles constrain the ongoing search for molecular mechanisms, examine the limitations of various approaches, and compare contradicting models and proposed molecular mechanisms.","All cells share the basic challenge of integrating the various processes that ensure their faithful replication.

10.1016/j.vetpar.2025.110527,Cultivation of a wild type Taenia crassiceps isolate from a zoo-kept Lemur and its application in anthelmintic drug testing.,"Taenia crassiceps, a cestode cycling between canids and rodents, poses a significant threat to zoo-kept primates, which are highly susceptible to severe cysticercosis. Fenbendazole is commonly used for treatment, though efficacy varies with lesion severity and localization of the disease-causing metacestode. In this study, T. crassiceps metacestodes, molecularly confirmed, were obtained from skin lesions collected from a Lemur catta that died at Zoo Salzburg. Parasites were cultured and treated with standard anthelmintics - albendazole, fenbendazole, mebendazole, and praziquantel - at 40 μM to evaluate in vitro efficacy. Young (1-week) and old (17-week) cultures were used to asses drug efficacy by damage-marker release assay measuring the release of phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) after 5 and 12 days. An automated assay measured motility reduction. Both drug testing methods were adapted from a well-established in vitro system for Echinococcus, enabling future cross-species comparisons. Praziquantel showed the most pronounced effect on parasite integrity after 12 days (29 % PGI release versus detergent control) and completely halted motility. Benzimidazoles were less effective when tested at same concentrations. Albendazole and mebendazole showed moderate PGI release (14 %), while fenbendazole showed none. Among benzimidazoles, mebendazole reduced motility most (49 %), followed by albendazole (56 %) and fenbendazole (87 %). We successfully adapted in vitro screening methods for T. crassiceps metacestodes using established techniques for Echinococcus. Although not aimed at identifying alternative treatments, findings suggest praziquantel - alone or with mebendazole - may offer more effective management for T. crassiceps in zoo primates than fenbendazole alone until better therapies become available.","Taenia crassiceps, a cestode cycling between canids and rodents, poses a significant threat to zoo-kept primates, which are highly susceptible to severe cysticercosis.

In this study, a feasible and economical strategy based on optimization sludge retention time (SRT) operation was proposed to address this issue, leveraging the kinetic differences between ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). A HRPN reactor was operated for 225 days with dissolved oxygen (DO) of 2.2-5.6 mg/L and high nitrogen loading rate (NLR) of 1.2-1.6 kg N/m<sup>3</sup>/d. Under the SRT of 3 days, the HRPN reactor was successfully started up in 11 days (nitrite accumulation rate, NAR ≥90 %) and the ratio of nitrite to ammonia nitrogen in the effluent is 1. Optimization of SRT during the later operation stage successfully restored the NAR from 71.35 % to 90.93 %, achieving stable operation 80 days of HRPN in continuous flow reactor. The findings of this study demonstrate that both kinetics and microbiology indicate that SRT optimization helps to selectively enrich fast-growing AOB, which is critical for the stability of HRPN in municipal wastewater. The two-stage HRPN-Anammox process proposed in this study has demonstrated superior stability and efficiency in mass balance analysis. Furthermore, it has been shown to be more cost-effective and sustainable in reducing chemical dosage and biomass compared to the traditional PN.","High-rate partial nitritation (HRPN) of municipal wastewater is receiving increasing attention, but how to achieve the rapid start-up and stable operation of municipal wastewater HRPN in continuous flow reactor remains a technical challenge.

Despite the potential role of sink drains in the transmission of ARB in nosocomial infections, routine surveillance of these drains is lacking in most hospitals. As a result, there is currently no comprehensive understanding of the transmission of ARB and the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and associated mobile genetic elements (MGEs) via sink drains. This study employed a multifaceted approach to monitor the total aerobic bacteria as well as the presence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPEs), the microbiota and the resistome of sink drain biofilms (SDBs) and hospital wastewater (WW) of two separate intensive care units (ICUs) in the same healthcare facility in France. Samples of SDB and WW were collected on a monthly basis, from January to April 2023, in the neonatal (NICU) and the adult (AICU) ICUs of Grenoble Alpes University Hospital. In the NICU, sink drain disinfection with surfactants was performed routinely. In the AICU, routine disinfection is not carried out. Culturable aerobic bacteria were quantified on non-selective media, and CPEs were screened using two selective agars. Isolates were identified by MALDI-TOF MS, and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) was performed on Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa. The resistome was analyzed by high-throughput qPCR targeting >80 ARGs and MGEs. The overall bacterial microbiota was assessed via full-length 16S rRNA sequencing. No CPEs were isolated from SDBs in either ICU by bacterial culture. Culture-independent approaches revealed an overall distinct microbiota composition of the SDBs in the two ICUs. The AICU SDBs were dominated by pathogens containing Gram-negative bacterial genera including Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomona, Klebsiella, and Gram-positive Staphylococcus, while the NICU SDBs were dominated by the Gram-negative genera Achromobacter, Serratia, and Acidovorax, as well as the Gram-positive genera Weisella and Lactiplantibacillus. In contrast, the resistome of the SDBs exhibited no significant differences between the two ICUs, indicating that the abundance of ARGs and MGEs is independent of microbiota composition and disinfection practices. The AICU WW exhibited more distinct aerobic bacteria than the NICU WW. In addition, the AICU WW yielded 15 CPEs, whereas the NICU WW yielded a single CPE. All the CPEs were characterized at the species level. The microbiota of the NICU and AICU WW samples differed from their respective SDBs and exhibited distinct variations over the four-month period:the AICU WW contained a greater number of genes conferring resistance to quinolones and integron integrase genes, whereas the NICU WW exhibited a higher abundance of streptogramin resistance genes. Our study demonstrated that the resistome of the hospital SDBs in the two ICUs of the investigated healthcare institute is independent of the microbiota, the environment, and the local disinfection measures. However, the prevalence of CPEs in the WW pipes collecting the waste from the investigated drains differed.

Conventional flocculants primarily target colloids and particulates but exhibit limited efficacy against dissolved organic compounds and emerging contaminants, leading to increased downstream treatment costs. Here, we present an innovative octopus-like biomass-based flocculant (OBF) designed for efficient, one-step removal of a broad-spectrum of water contaminants. The structure of OBF harnesses lignin's interfacial interactions (hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and π-π interactions) combined with the electrostatic attraction of cationic branches, achieving removal efficiencies exceeding 90% for humic acid, kaolin, microplastics, and bacteria (96.1% Escherichia coli, 100% Staphylococcus aureus), alongside 98.8% microalgae harvesting. In practical applications, OBF reduced lake water turbidity to 0.75 NTU and municipal wastewater chemical oxygen demand (COD) by 85.2%, surpassing the performance of conventional flocculants. With low toxicity, broad pH adaptability, and sustainable biomass sourcing, OBF offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for water treatment. The structural design and interfacial modulation of this graft polymer represent a significant advance in multifunctional water purification technologies.","Flocculation plays a critical role in water purification, directly influencing treatment efficiency and costs.

Molecular compositional changes in the cells have been monitored during the viral invasion activity using Raman spectroscopy and principal components analysis (PCA). The cell with virus infection showed molecular changes which mostly attributed to protein at only 2 h post infection. It suggests that the molecular changes represent a very early cellular reaction against the viral invasion, because the changes have taken place too early to activate the reactions induced by the virus. We have successfully detected the molecular changes of the live cells also when they met the second viral infection.

To improve the adaptability of pitaya on islands or soil salinization, it is of great significance to explore the salt tolerance mechanisms of pitaya. While oxalate has been conventionally characterized as an antinutrient metabolite, emerging evidence underscores its dual role as a stress signaling molecule through homeostatic regulation. Here, we demonstrate that dynamic control of oxalate catabolism is essential for pitaya's salt adaptation. Transcriptomic profiling revealed coordinated upregulation of the oxalate-degrading gene HuAAE3 under salt stress, accompanied by enhanced oxalate accumulation. Notably, the transcription factor HubHLH36 emerged as a central regulator responding to both ionic stress and oxalate. Molecular validation through yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays unveiled confirmed that HubHLH36 directly activates HuAAE3 transcription by binding to its promoter. Transient overexpression of HuAAE3 or HubHLH36 in pitaya plants significantly reduced oxalate levels, enhanced salt/oxalate tolerance, and alleviated reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Conversely, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of these genes elevated oxalate content, compromised stress tolerance, and exacerbated ROS production. Heterologous expression in Arabidopsis further validated the conserved function of HubHLH36-HuAAE3 module in conferring salt/oxalate tolerance with ROS mitigation. Our findings establish a novel transcriptional regulatory module where HubHLH36 modulates oxalate homeostasis via HuAAE3 activation, thereby mitigating oxidative stress under salt stress. These mechanistic insights provide genetic targets and theoretical frameworks for developing salt-tolerant pitaya cultivars, offering promising solutions for sustainable agriculture in saline environments.","Pitaya (Hylocereus polyrhizus) is one of the subtropical and tropical fruits, has gained global cultivation interest due to its nutritional, medicinal, and economic value.

The damage caused by TSWV has made the development of new and effective botanical antiviral agents against the disease increasingly urgent. Many kinds of compounds have been found to control disease caused by TSWV. However, novel alkaloid for the effectively control of this disease remain rarely. In this study, a series of compounds of novel alkaloid were extracted from Corydalis saxicola Bunting and their structure was elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance mass spectrometry (NMR- MS). The compounds demonstrated anti-TSWV activity in vivo. The protective and curative activities of berberine (ber) (100 μg/mL) were 62.00 % and 50.00 %, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of commercial ningnanmycin and other compounds. Several concentrations of ber were tested in vitro, and the most effective concentration with an anti-TSWV activity greater than 76.00 % (200 μg/mL). Transcriptome analysis revealed that ber induced multiple genes related with glutathione S-transferase activity, auxin-activated signaling pathway, sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis, intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport. In addition, GO, KEGG and RT-qPCR showed that ber primarily acted on the enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GSTAU25) to improve the resistance to TSWV infection. Subsequent virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) combined with overexpression was used to verify that ber regulated the inhibition of the expression of NSs and NSm genes via GSTAU25. Therefore, the results indicated that ber can stimulate GSTAU25 and thereby enhance the defense against TSWV. This study identified ber as a promising natural botanical antiviral agent for future study, and the results provide a theoretical basis for the application of ber in Orthotospovirus management.","Tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus (TSWV) is a serious plant pathogen of crops that causes serious damage in the agriculture industry.

The bioelectrochemical reactor was operated under cathodic conditions (-0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl) with acetate as carbon source as a mean to evaluate i) PHB production and ii) bioelectrochemical performance. We observed how a cathodic polarization of the moving electrode played a key role on PHB production stimulating both direct microbial electron uptake from the conductive bed and electrochemically produced hydrogen in the vicinity of the current collector. Overall, the polarized reactor outperformed the non-polarized reactor by four-fold regarding PHB production rate. In addition, microbial communities analysis revealed Rhodopseudomonas sp. and Bradyrhizobium sp. as main genera in combination with other electroactive genera like Geosporobacter sp.

This study investigated the synergistic potential of two anthranilamide-based peptide mimics (RK610 and RK758) in combination, and one peptide mimic (RK610) in combination with the cationic peptides Mel4 and melimine, against murine hepatitis virus (a coronavirus; MHV-1), influenza virus (H1N1), and Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1). Checkerboard assays demonstrated RK610+RK758 had synergy against MHV-1 and H1N1 (∑FICI values of 0.14 and 0.5, respectively), while RK610+Mel4 showed potent synergy against HSV-1 (∑FICI = 0.18). Co-treatment outperformed sequential application. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed structural damage to virions, while cytotoxicity assays indicated that all tested combinations were non-toxic in MDCK, A9, and Vero cells, except for melimine and RK610+melimine with A9 cells. Biophysical analyses using DOPC (100 %) and DOPC: POPS (70:30) lipids provided mechanistic ideas into peptide-mimic interactions with lipid envelopes. Tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs) in conjunction with electrical impedance spectroscopy revealed that both peptide mimics and their combinations reduced membrane conductance, regardless of lipid composition. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) revealed that RK610 and RK758 induced mass addition at the outer layer, significantly increasing with POPS. In DOPC, RK610 increased the surface pressure in a Langmuir-Blodgett trough while RK758 reduced it. The 610 + 758 and 610+Mel4 combinations raised maximum pressures. In DOPC + POPS, RK758 destabilized the monolayer (35 mN/m, no plateau), whereas combinations restored stability. These findings highlight peptide mimics as broad-spectrum antiviral agents that show synergy to target viral envelopes, paving the way for safer and low-resistance therapeutics.","The global health impact of viruses highlights the urgent need for innovative antiviral strategies.

10.1111/ctr.70186,Hepatitis C Nucleic Acid Test Positive (NAT+) Solid Organ Consent Rates Are Highest in Patients Listed for Liver Transplant and With an English Language Preference.,"Transplantation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleic acid (NAT) positive organs is associated with shorter time to transplant and decreased risk of death on the waiting list. Treatment for HCV post-transplant is well-tolerated, successful, and leads to similar transplant outcomes to patients transplanted with HCV NAT- organs. Despite these outcomes, not all patients consent to receive HCV NAT+ organs, and factors associated with consent are not well-known. This retrospective single-center study of adult patients listed for heart, liver, lung, and kidney transplant aimed to determine whether sociodemographic and organ-specific disparities exist in consent for HCV NAT+ donor organs. Of 2788 transplant candidates, 44% (N = 1229) consented to receive an HCV NAT+ organ. Patients who designated English as their preferred language were more likely to consent compared to a non-English preference (45% vs. 19%, p < 0.001). Consent rates were highest amongst patients listed for liver transplantation compared to kidney, heart, and lung transplants (67%, N = 319 vs. 42%, N = 602 vs. 38%, N = 159 vs. 32%, N = 149; p < 0.001). Overall, more efforts are needed to ensure that all patients who may benefit from consenting for HCV NAT+ organs are appropriately educated in their language of choice on the risks and benefits.","Transplantation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleic acid (NAT) positive organs is associated with shorter time to transplant and decreased risk of death on the waiting list.

This report describes a rapidly progressive case in a 6-month-old immunocompetent infant who presented with necrotic facial lesions progressing to extensive eschar over 2 weeks. Despite prompt histopathological confirmation, radical surgical debridement, and immediate liposomal amphotericin B therapy, the infant succumbed to sudden deterioration 3 months after apparent clinical resolution. Initial biopsies confirmed cutaneous mucormycosis with characteristic broad, pauci-septate hyphae, while repeat biopsies at 1 month showed no residual disease. Laboratory and imaging findings were unremarkable, and fungal cultures remained negative. This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of pediatric mucormycosis, particularly in immunocompetent hosts, and underscores the potential for fatal relapse despite adherence to treatment protocols. The paradoxical outcome emphasizes the need for prolonged antifungal therapy, advanced molecular monitoring, and equitable access to diagnostics in resource-limited settings.","Cutaneous mucormycosis, a rare and life-threatening fungal infection caused by <i>Mucorales</i> species, predominantly affects immunocompromised individuals.

To achieve such control, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) sense bacterial cues and induce the production of antimicrobials. Here, we uncover a metabolic arm in the control of symbionts by PRRs. We show that, in Drosophila, the PRRs PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE act independently of canonical NF-κB signaling to repress essential metabolic functions in the gut, such as digestion and central carbon metabolism. This metabolic switch affects commensal populations and drastically reduces intestinal and systemic populations of the intracellular parasite Wolbachia. We propose that intestinal metabolic remodeling complements immune responses by imposing nutrient restriction on intracellular bacteria, whose lifestyle protects them from antimicrobials. Our findings reveal a role for PRRs in bacterial control beyond canonical immune pathways and provide insights into how microbial signals modulate symbiotic populations but also nutrition and metabolism in animals.","Animals coexist with bacteria and need to keep these microorganisms under tight control.

Adults over 50 years of age face higher risks of severe influenza due to increasing chronic conditions associated with aging, yet vaccination rates in this group are low, as recommendations start from age 65. This study explores the potential health and economic benefits of expanding vaccination recommendations to individuals aged 50 and over. Using the literature and French health insurance data, a SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model was developed. The subpopulations were stratified by age, vaccination status, and risk profile. Various expanded vaccination strategies were compared to the current strategy, assessing impacts on epidemiological outcomes (consultations, hospitalizations, deaths), economic metrics (vaccination costs, medical care expenses), and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The model's robustness was tested with deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Expanded vaccination recommendations for individuals over 50 years of age lead to an average reduction of 500,124 consultations, 9486 hospitalizations, and 2990 deaths, with an associated additional cost of 58 million euros compared to the current vaccination strategy. The cost-effectiveness analysis estimates an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €1496/QALY. When considering indirect costs, the total savings in this expanded vaccination scenario amount to €- 314,308,377, resulting in a dominant ICER. This indicates that the strategy would not only be more cost-effective but also cost-saving compared to the current approach. Expanding vaccination recommendations for low-risk adults over 50 is cost-effective and represents a significant public health opportunity.","Influenza in France causes, on average, more than 1 million primary care consultations, 20,000 hospitalizations, and 9000 deaths annually.

One approach that is gaining prominence is the utilization of plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) in mainstream agriculture. Interactions between plants and microbes in the rhizosphere play a vital role in plant health, productivity, and soil fertility. PGPB, particularly endophytes that establish close associations with plants, have shown success in promoting plant growth and protecting plants against diseases and abiotic stresses through various mechanisms, including biological nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, siderophore production, phytohormone production, ACC-deaminase activity, induced systemic resistance, quorum sensing, hydrogen cyanide synthesis, hydrolytic enzyme and colonization niche specialization. While there is no one-size-fits-all strategy for promoting the growth of every plant under every condition, certain strategies discussed in this review already demonstrate significant promise. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of the fundamental mechanisms employed by PGPB, and emphasizes innovative methods for identifying and developing promising strains to serve as bio-inputs. Likewise, the aim of this review is to present a summary of the crucial role that soil-plant-microorganisms interactions play in the development of efficient bioinoculants, as well as to explore biotechnological advances. Bacteria from genera such as Azospirillum, Bacillus, Bradyrhizobium, and Pseudomonas have already been widely studied and applied for these purposes. However, further research is needed to improve strain performance and enhance the potential of multifunctional microorganisms. Deepening the genetic and biochemical understanding of these mechanisms and expanding their applications is essential to foster safe and sustainable agronomic practices.","Given the impact of abiotic and biotic factors on agriculture, it is crucial to adopt sustainable and environmentally friendly practices to enhance yields.

Microorganisms cause spoilage through the utilization of three main metabolic processes: (i) proteolytic degradation of muscle proteins, (ii) lipolytic breakdown of triglycerides, and (iii) production of volatile bioactive organic compounds and biogenic amines. By combining high-throughput sequencing with metabolomics, researchers have been uncovering strain-specific metabolic networks and how they are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, pH, and packaging. This review systematically examines: (1) patterns of taxonomic succession in spoilage microbiota, (2) enzymatic and biochemical pathways involved in spoilage, and (3) innovative preservation strategies targeting spoilage consortia. Emerging technologies, such as bacteriocin-mediated biopreservation, phage therapy, and modified atmosphere packaging, show considerable promise in inhibiting spoilage organisms while maintaining the sensory qualities of the fish. Microbiome-directed interventions combined with predictive modeling and precision storage systems also represent a novel approach to fish preservation.

PLCPs are involved in plant growth and development, as well as stress and plant immune responses. Currently, few studies have reported on the involvement of PLCPs in defence against viral infections. Here, we show that RD21 of strawberry (Fragaria vesca) interacts with the strawberry vein banding virus (SVBV) P6 protein. SVBV infection induces FvRD21 expression. Subcellular localization revealed that FvRD21 and P6 colocalize in the perinuclear and cytoplasmic regions. Further analysis showed that FvRD21 overexpression induces the autophagy pathway that degrades the P6 protein, destroys the function of P6 as a viral suppressor of RNA silencing (VSR), inhibits the pathogenicity of P6, and confers resistance to SVBV in strawberry plants. Moreover, mutant FvRD21<sup>H300A</sup> lost its ability to interact with SVBV P6 and did not affect P6 accumulation and VSR function. Additionally, abscisic acid (ABA) pretreatment of strawberry plants promoted FvRD21 upregulation and inhibited SVBV infection, and FvRD21 overexpression activated the ABA pathway. In summary, FvRD21 inhibits SVBV infection by degrading SVBV P6 through the autophagy pathway.

The severity of COVID-19 varies, ranging from asymptomatic cases to mild symptoms, acute respiratory failure and death. Genetic factors are believed to influence individual responses to the virus. This study investigates the association between two common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Toll-like receptors (TLRs)-TLR2 rs3804099 (+597 C/T) and TLR4 rs4986790 (+896 A/G)-and disease severity and inflammatory markers in Moroccan COVID-19 patients. A total of 452 COVID-19 patients (259 with mild/moderate disease and 193 with severe disease) were included. TLR2 and TLR4 SNPs were genotyped using a predesigned TaqMan real-time allelic discrimination assay. Complete blood count samples, along with levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, procalcitonin and D-dimer, were assessed using automated methods. No significant associations were observed between either SNP in TLR2 and TLR4 and disease severity under various genetic models. However, in severe cases, TLR4 rs4986790 showed a significant association with ferritin levels (p = 0.0002) and lymphocyte count (p < 0.0001). TLR2 rs3804099 was linked to CRP levels in severe patients (p = 0.036). No associations were observed with anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG or anti-N IgG levels in severe cases (p > 0.05). These findings suggest that although TLR4 and TLR2 polymorphisms are not directly associated with COVID-19 severity, they may influence the inflammatory response. Specifically, TLR4 rs4986790 and TLR2 rs3804099 appear to modulate ferritin and CRP levels, potentially impacting disease progression in severe cases.","The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has significantly impacted global health, with Morocco reporting over 1.2 million confirmed cases and more than 16,300 deaths.

While linear mRNA vaccines are prone to degradation and can trigger strong innate immune responses, covalently closed circRNA vaccines leverage their unique circular structure to enhance molecular stability and minimize innate immune activation, positioning them as a next-generation platform for vaccine development. Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing circRNA vaccine design and optimization. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, integrate multi-omics data to refine antigen prediction, RNA secondary structure modeling, and lipid nanoparticle delivery system formulation, surpassing traditional bioinformatics approaches in both accuracy and efficiency. While AI-driven bioinformatics enhances antigen screening and delivery system modeling, generative AI accelerates literature synthesis and experimental planning-though the risk of fabricated references and limited biological interpretability hinders its reliability. Despite these advancements, challenges such as the ""black-box"" nature of AI algorithms, unreliable literature retrieval, and insufficient integration of biological mechanisms underscore the necessity for a hybrid ""AI-traditional-experimental"" paradigm. This approach integrates explainable AI frameworks, multi-omics validation, and ethical oversight to ensure clinical translatability. Future research should prioritize mechanism-driven AI models, real-time experimental feedback, and rigorous ethical standards to fully unlock the potential of circRNA vaccines in precision oncology and global health.","Circular RNA (circRNA) vaccines have emerged as a groundbreaking innovation in infectious disease prevention and cancer immunotherapy, offering superior stability and reduced immunogenicity compared to conventional linear messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines.

10.1186/s13099-025-00713-4,Exploring the role of intestinal pathogenic bacteria in metronidazole-induced bone loss: focus on Klebsiella variicola.,"Antibiotic use is known to contribute to the development of osteoporosis, although the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. Metronidazole (MET), a commonly prescribed antibiotic for treating anaerobic infections, has been linked to alterations in the gut microbiota (GM), which in turn are associated with various adverse side effects in the host. Recent studies have shown that the GM plays a key role in regulating bone homeostasis, though the underlying mechanisms remain under investigation. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that MET promotes inflammatory osteoporosis through gut dysbiosis, with Klebsiella variicola (K. variicola) identified as a major pathogen influencing bone metabolism. The pro-inflammatory extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by K. variicola induce enhanced inflammatory responses and osteoclastic differentiation in both bone macrophages and bone tissue. Notably, the use of antibiotics that target K. variicola effectively mitigates MET-induced bone loss in vivo. This study expands our understanding of the mechanisms underlying antibiotic-induced bone loss and underscores the significant role of the pathogenic bacterium K. variicola in the development of osteoporosis, providing new avenues for future research on the microbiota-gut-bone axis in bone-related diseases.","Antibiotic use is known to contribute to the development of osteoporosis, although the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood.

This study explored how the gut symbiont Acinetobacter sp. AS23 of a Camellia weevil (Curculio chinensis) (CW) enhances the weevil's tolerance to toxic tea saponins in host plants. We first conducted toxicity assays in which third-instar CW larvae were exposed to fermentation filtrates containing tea saponin degradation products from the weevil's gut bacterium, the AS23 strain. A combination of metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses was used to investigate the degradation pathway and key genes used by the AS23 strain in tea saponin metabolism. We then re-inoculated axenic larvae with bacterial mutants generated through CRISPR-Cas9 and verified gene functions in tea saponin degradation. Toxicity assays demonstrated that the AS23 strain exhibited time-dependent tea saponin degradation capabilities. The benzoate degradation pathway emerged as a core metabolic pathway enriched during tea saponin degradation, with the involvement of four key enzyme genes confirmed through qPCR and functional studies. Knockout strains exhibited a significantly reduced detoxification capacity and increased larval mortality when reintroduced into CWs' gut. Our findings elucidated the key role of the AS23 strain in mediating CW larvae tolerance to tea saponins through the benzoate degradation pathway. This study highlights the potential of leveraging microbial saponin degradation pathways for developing environmentally friendly pest control strategies.","The extent to which herbivorous insects depend on gut bacteria and the molecular mechanisms by which these microbes help overcome host plant chemical defenses remain controversial.

Calf diarrhea, being the main contributor to calf morbidity and mortality, is a major issue within the livestock sector in Ethiopia. However, studies on viruses and the virome in calves is lacking in the country. Therefore, we utilized viral metagenomics to investigate the diversity of RNA viruses in healthy and diarrheic calves from central Ethiopia. Fecal material from 47 calves were collected, pooled, and sequenced using Illumina. Following sequencing, the virome composition and individual viral sequences were investigated using bioinformatic analysis. The metagenomic analysis revealed the presence of several RNA viruses, including rotavirus and bovine coronavirus, known causative agents in calf diarrhea. In addition, several enteric RNA viruses that have not been detected in cattle in Ethiopia previously, such as norovirus, nebovirus, astrovirus, torovirus, kobuvirus, enterovirus, boosepivirus and hunnivirus were identified. Furthermore, a highly divergent viral sequence, which we gave the working name suluvirus, was found. Suluvirus showed a similar genome structure to viruses within the Picornaviridae family and phylogenetic analysis showed that it clusters with crohiviruses. However, due to its very divergent amino acid sequence, we propose that suluvirus represent either a new genus within the Picornaviridae or a new species within crohiviruses. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of the RNA virome in Ethiopian cattle and the study revealed multiple RNA viruses circulating in both diarrheic and healthy calves, as well as a putative novel virus, suluvirus. Our study highlights that viral metagenomics is a powerful tool in understanding the divergence of viruses and their possible association to calf diarrhea, enabling characterization of known viruses as well as discovery of novel viruses.","Viruses and the virome have received increased attention in the context of calf diarrhea and with the advancement of high-throughput sequencing the detection and discovery of viruses has been improved.

10.1186/s13567-025-01547-3,Getah virus nonstructural protein 2 suppresses interferon-beta production by interrupting interferon regulatory factor 3 activation.,"Getah virus (GETV), a neglected and re-emerging mosquito-borne alphavirus, has become more serious and poses a potential threat to animal safety and public health. The innate immune response is critical for host defence against viral infection, and the dysregulation of host innate immune responses likely aggravates GETV infection. In this study, we use unbiased screening to identify GETV proteins that antagonise type I interferon (IFN-I) response. We found that GETV Nsp2 could inhibit Sendai virus or poly(I:C)-induced IFN-β promoter activation, potently suppressing primary interferon production- a key component of the host's innate immunity antiviral response. Remarkably, Nsp2 showed efficient inhibition of the IRF3-responsive promoter, but not AP-1 or NF-κB. Further examination revealed that Nsp2 significantly suppressed luciferase activity when RIG-I-CARD, MDA5, MAVS, or IRF3 activated the IFN-β promoter. By contrast, IRF3/5D led to less suppression of luciferase expression, partially restoring luciferase activity, suggesting that Nsp2 interferes with the biological function of IRF3 as a crucial strategy in its antagonism of IFN-β production. Mechanistically, Nsp2 binds TBK1 to suppress IRF3 phosphorylation. Meanwhile, Nsp2 competitively inhibited the interaction of pIRF3 with KPNA3 and KPNA4, to inhibit IRF3 nuclear translocation. Overall, we demonstrated that GETV suppresses antiviral innate immunity by inhibiting the activation of IRF3, and Nsp2 plays a crucial role in this process. These findings reveal a novel strategy by which GETV evades the host innate immune response, providing new insights into the pathogenesis of GETV.","Getah virus (GETV), a neglected and re-emerging mosquito-borne alphavirus, has become more serious and poses a potential threat to animal safety and public health.

This study included 82 PLHIV who were presumed to have TB and were admitted to Yunnan Infectious Disease Hospital from December 1, 2023, to July 1, 2024. General clinical data were collected. Urine samples were collected from all patients and subjected to AIMLAM antigen detection via chemiluminescence. Appropriate samples (such as sputum or other samples) were collected from patients in good condition for MGIT 960 mycobacterial culture (MGIT 960), GeneXpert-MTB/RIF testing (Xpert), and acid‒fast bacillus staining (AFB). According to the gold standard for outcome prediction, the patient’s history, clinical symptoms, confirmed microbiological features, and radiological/imaging findings, etc., were integrated to predict the overall outcome. Urinary AIMLAM antigen detection demonstrated greater sensitivity (83.3%) and specificity (70.7%) than MGIT 960 culture, GeneXpert-MTB/RIF, and AFB staining for diagnosing advanced HIV disease (AHD)-related TB. The diagnostic efficacy of urinary AIMLAM antigen detection was superior to that of the other tests, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.774, indicating significant clinical value in diagnosing TB among patients with AHD. There were 33 AIMLAM antigen-positive cases with CD4 cell counts ≤ 200 cells/µL, but the results for 14 cases were identified as false positives because of coinfections with nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), invasive fungal infections, or severe bacterial infections. Statistically significant differences in signal-to-cutoff ratio (S/CO) values from AIMLAM testing were observed among patients with mycobacterial, fungal, and bacterial infections (<i>P</i> < 0.05), but no significant difference was detected between patients with TB and those with NTM infections (<i>P</i> > 0.05). Urine AIMLAM antigen detection is an effective tool for initial screening of TB in patients with AHD. It has higher sensitivity than MGIT 960, GeneXpert-MTB/RIF, and AFB smear, but the method needs to be optimized to increase its specificity. Positive AIMLAM results with high S/CO values suggest mycobacterial infection, although it cannot be used to differentiate TB from NTM infections. Low S/CO values in HIV patients warrant the consideration of fungal or other opportunistic infections. Species-specific confirmation is needed before treatment initiation.","To evaluate the diagnostic performance and clinical utility of a new antigen test for the detection of urinary lipoarabinomannan (AIMLAM) in people living with HIV (PLHIV) with comorbid tuberculosis (TB).

We isolated a genogroup II AKAV strain, TJ2016, in China in 2016, but its virulence remains unknown. The pathogenic potential of other genogroup II strains isolated in China also remains uncharacterized. The objectives of this study were to determine the pathogenicity of TJ2016. Kunming or Balb/c mice at 7 days or 8 weeks of age were inoculated with TJ2016 by intracerebral (IC), intraperitoneal (IP), subcutaneous (SC), or intramuscular (IM) routes. Clinical signs, pathological alterations, and AKAV distributions in the inoculated mice were monitored and analyzed. Virus inoculations by the IC route resulted in 75% ~ 100% mortality of the inoculated mice regardless of the mouse strains or ages. Virus inoculations by the IP route killed 75% to 100% of the suckling mice but killed no adult mice. All the mice inoculated via SC and IM routes survived until the end of the trial. AKAV was detected only in the brains of the mice that died or were euthanized before the end of the experiment. The AKAV antigens were only identifiable within neuronal cells. Brain lesions such as proliferation and infiltration of microglial cells, perivascular cuffing (PVC) of lymphocytes and macrophages, neuronal degeneration/necrosis, vascular dilatation and congestion, etc., were observed only in the mice that died or were euthanized before the end of the experiment.

The hedgehogs' synanthropic lifestyle results in frequent contact with pets and humans, posing the risk of parasite spillover from a One Health perspective. The present study assessed the endoparasite fauna and excretion intensity of 531 European hedgehogs presented at wildlife rehabilitation centres in Germany. Faecal samples were examined by the combined sedimentation-flotation method, the Baermann technique and FASTest® CRYPTO-GIARDIA Strips (MEGACOR Diagnostik GmbH) from July 2018 to May 2021. Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. positive samples were further differentiated via amplification of the 60 kDa glycoprotein gene and the β-giardin gene, respectively.

Detected protozoans included coccidia (12.8%, [68/531]), Cryptosporidium spp. (11.9%, [63/531]) and Giardia spp. (1.3%, [7/531]). Acanthocephala spp. were present in 1.5% (8/531) of samples, and two examined specimens were molecularly identified as Plagiorhynchus cylindraceus. Infections with C. aerophila showed a significant seasonal pattern and a negative correlation with bodyweight. For the remaining parasites, no significant associations with age, bodyweight, survival or seasonality were observed. Molecular typing revealed the presence of Cryptosporidium parvum subtype IIa prevalence of 2.1%, [11/531]), IIc (0.9%, [5/531]) and IId (0.6%, [3/531]), Cryptosporidium erinacei subtype XIIIa (6.1%, [33/531]) and XIIIb (0.2%, [1/531]), and Giardia duodenalis (sub)assemblage A(1) (1.3%, [7/531]). The hedgehogs showed high infection rates with pulmonary and gastrointestinal helminths. Molecular analysis clarified the species distribution of the gastrointestinal Capillaria, consisting of C. erinacei and C. putorii, disproving the existence of the previously described Capillaria ovoreticulata.

However, the precise association between one lipid homeostasis indicator, remnant cholesterol (RC), and HBV-ACLF prognoses have not been fully elucidated. In this retrospective study, the relationship between RC with 28- and 90-day HBV-ACLF prognoses was delineated. 595 HBV-ACLF patients were recruited, and data collected for laboratory parameters at admission, as well as whether poor 28- and 90-day prognoses occurred during the follow-up period, in the form of mortality, or liver transplantation. Patients were divided into 3 groups, based on RC tertiles (Q1-3), and 4 multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify the associations between RC levels and ACLF prognoses; these analyses excluded different confounding factors, based on the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement. Stratified analysis was conducted to investigate the association between RC and ACLF risk among different subgroups, based on age, sex as well as complications and artificial liver treatment. RC accuracy versus that of other lipid indicators to predict 28- and 90-day ACLF survival was evaluated by restricted cubic spline and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, while Kaplan-Meier curves measured cumulative 28- and 90-day mortality risks. For all 4 regression models, higher RC were associated with worse liver function, coagulation, and HBV-ACLF prognoses. Restricted cubic spline analysis identified a non-linear relationship between RC and HBV-ACLF prognoses, in which the Q3 RC tertile had the lowest 28-day and 90-day HBV-ACLF survival rates; this was further confirmed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Additionally, subgroup analysis found that higher RC correlated to worse ACLF prognoses among hypoproteinemia patients. Moreover, RC, compared to total cholesterol, triglycerides, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as non-high density lipoprotein, was the most accurate in predicting poor 28- and 90-day ACLF prognoses. Elevated RC was significantly associated with poorer 28- and 90-day HBV-ACLF prognoses, even after accounting for all other traditional risk factors. Therefore, monitoring RC, along with interventions to reduce their levels, could aid in improving ACLF patient outcomes.","Hepatitis B-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF) patients possess adverse lipid homeostatic alterations, subsequently affecting their treatment regimens and prognoses.

This prospective study included patients aged ≥ 65 years admitted to the emergency department of Besançon University Hospital over a six-month period. Clinical and biological data were collected and UTI diagnosis was based on strict clinical and biological criteria. Urine analysis was performed using the UF-4000 (Sysmex). Parameters or thresholds were defined based on an AUC > 0.8 and a clinically relevant negative likelihood ratio (LR-) < 0.1. Of 456 patients, 69 (15.1%) had a UTI. Bacteriuria (AUC = 0.874) and leukocyturia (AUC = 0.925) were strongly associated with UTI, with thresholds of 150 bacteria/µL and 50 leukocytes/µL (both LR- < 0.1). These cut-offs varied by sex. Urine dipsticks effectively excluded UTI in men (LR- < 0.1), but were less reliable in women (LR- = 0.129). Gender-specific diagnostic algorithms were suggested. Urine flow cytometry provides valuable diagnostic thresholds for bacteriuria and leukocyturia and helps to exclude UTI before culture results. Recommendations for the diagnosis of UTI in older patients should take into account gender differences.","To evaluate the utility of automated urine flow cytometry in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in older patients without waiting for urine culture results.

We set-up a retrospective cohort study to analyze data from 12,815 pregnant women who delivered in three Hangzhou tertiary hospitals between 2015 and 2022. Four groups were created according to the presence of HBV and/or GDM as follows: a non-HBVC & GDM group (n = 5,323), a HBVC group (n = 5,508), a GDM group (n = 919) and a HBVC & GDM group (n = 1,065). Univariate analysis was carried out with the Mann-Whitney U test or the chi-squared test; P < 0.05 was used as the screening criterion. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was then performed to investigate the effects of each of the relevant confounders on HBVC, GDM and HBVC & GDM. After adjusting for potential confounding variables, the results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), with P < 0.05 considered as statistically significant. The incidence of HBVC & GDM among pregnant women in Hangzhou, China was 0.96% (95% CI: 0.90-1.02%). The median maternal age of the pregnant women in the HBVC & GDM group was significantly higher than that in the HBVC, GDM and control groups (31.00 vs. 30.00, 30.00, 29.00, P < 0.001). The proportions of low birth weight (4.0% vs. 3.8%, 3.4%, 3.4%) and macrosomia (6.8% vs. 5.4%, 3.7%, 4.3%) in the HBVC & GDM group were significantly higher than in the other three groups, with significant differences between groups (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed a progressive increase in risk values with increasing maternal age in the HBVC & GDM group (OR<sub>≥ 25&<30</sub>=1.632, OR<sub>≥ 30&<35</sub>=3.257, and OR<sub>≥ 35</sub>=5.611). In addition, the carriage risk of pregnant women over 35 years was approximately two-fold higher than that in the HBVC and GDM groups (5.611/2.251 and 5.611/3.130), respectively. The risk value increased progressively with increasing gravidity (OR<sub>2</sub> = 1.364 and OR<sub>≥ 3</sub>=1.765). The risk of a floating population was as follows: Zhejiang-registered but non-Hangzhou (OR = 2.246) > outside Zhejiang Province (OR = 1.953) > Hangzhou-local (OR = 1). HBVC & GDM also increased the risk of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) (OR = 3.143, 95% CI: 2.223-4.445), pre-eclampsia (PE) (OR = 2.017, 95%CI: 1.315-3.095), macrosomia (OR = 1.548, 95% CI: 1.161-2.064), assisted vaginal delivery (OR = 1.501, 95% CI: 1.185-1.901) and Caesarean section (OR = 1.258, 95% CI: 1.035-1.528). HBVC & GDM also reduced the chance of delayed labor (gestational age > 41 week, OR = 0.217, 95% CI: 0.126-0.374). The incidence rates of HBVC and GDM among pregnant women in Hangzhou City are relatively high. When HBVC & GDM co-existed, the risks of ICP, PE and macrosomia increased significantly. The risk of HBVC & GDM tended to increase progressively with increasing maternal age and increasing gravidity. For pregnant women of advanced age, those with increasing gravidity or those in a floating population, it is important to enhance educational awareness related to HBV, GDM, and especially HBVC & GDM in order to provide personalized antenatal medical care and reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.","To investigate the impact of hepatitis B virus carriers combined with gestational diabetes mellitus (HBVC & GDM) on pregnancy outcomes in a cohort of pregnant women from Hangzhou, China.

Here, we present a rapid and cost-effective solution-based NA active site proximity assay (NASPA) for measuring NA activity inhibitory (NAI) antibodies. This simplified assay uses large ""bulky"" NA active site-binding inhibitors to replace the sialylated glycoprotein substrates in common NA enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) approaches. Our results with ferret antisera and monoclonal antibodies against vaccine strain NAs show a strong correlation between NASPA and ELLA titers, and that NASPA titers are not influenced by anti-HA antibodies. Consequently, NASPA can be used with influenza A or B strains and with the latter it revealed incremental antigenic changes in the NAs from recent B Victoria lineage vaccine strains. By coupling NASPA with a simple activity assay, we also found that steric and active site-binding NAI antibodies against circulating NAs are common in adult human sera. Finally, we demonstrate that NASPA can be modified by incorporating novel NA substrate-analog-based inhibitors. Together, these results suggest that NASPA can aid the development of vaccines containing NA by helping to select suitable vaccine strains and profile anti-NA antibody responses.","Efficient approaches that can help to select vaccine strains for the influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) antigen are currently needed to advance the development of vaccines containing NA.

Exploration of A. acidoterrestris in response to acid stress could help control contamination caused by the bacteria. In this study, the mechanism of A. acidoterrestris in response to acid stress was studied by quantitative phosphoproteomics technique. Results showed that the phosphorylation of 40 proteins in A. acidoterrestris was closely related to the regulation of acid stress. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the quorum sensing pathway, which might be involved in the perception of A. acidoterrestris, was mainly enriched. We found that the upregulation of Spo0A and YidC phosphorylationmay resist acid stress by forming spores. The phosphorylation level of pyruvate kinase increased, which may improve bacterial acid stress resistance through the formation of energy supply. The phosphorylation level of ABC transporter permease was significantly upregulated, which may be part of the cell adaptation adjustment and contribute to the survival of A. acidoterrestris under acid stress. In summary, the molecular mechanism of acid stress regulation of A. acidoterrestris was proposed via quantitative phosphoproteomics, which provided a theoretical and experimental basis for further investigation of the acid resistance mechanism of A. acidoterrestris.

Sites influenced by human activity exhibited reduced actinomycete abundance and altered genus ratios compared to less disturbed areas. Among the isolated strains, many demonstrated the ability to produce siderophores for metals such as iron, nickel, copper, zinc, and manganese. Notably, five strains produced siderophores capable of binding all tested metals. Additionally, three strains exhibited the capacity to solubilize insoluble forms of both zinc and phosphorus while producing siderophores for all metals tested. Genomic analysis of one of these strains, namely, Streptomyces sp.

Co-localization of the S and N proteins within the VLPs was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibodies. To enable fluorescent quantification of VLPs, the C-terminus of the S protein was fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), and the N protein was tagged with EGFP at either the N- or C-terminus. Transient transfection of 293T cells with (S-GFP)NME, S(N-GFP)ME, or S(GFP-N)ME plasmids efficiently produced fluorescent VLPs, each demonstrating the ability to enter A549-hACE2 cells. In addition, a two-plasmid system was developed to simplify fluorescent VLP production by incorporating internal ribosomal entry site elements between N3xHA and S-GFP and between the M and E genes. Transfection of 293T cells with these plasmids produced VLPs with a fourfold higher N protein concentration (800 ng/mL) compared to the four-plasmid system (200 ng/mL), as measured by ELISA. Flow virometry analysis confirmed production of VLPs with an average diameter of 80 nm and a concentration of 1.68 × 10<sup>8</sup> particles/ml. This study demonstrates that production of fluorescent VLPs using a two-plasmid system is more efficient than the traditional four-plasmid approach.

Transfection of 293T cells with these plasmids produced VLPs with a fourfold higher N protein concentration (800 ng/mL) compared to the four-plasmid system (200 ng/mL), as measured by ELISA. Flow virometry analysis confirmed production of VLPs with an average diameter of 80 nm and a concentration of 1.68 × 10<sup>8</sup> particles/ml. This study demonstrates that production of fluorescent VLPs using a two-plasmid system is more efficient than the traditional four-plasmid approach. We also demonstrate that flow virometry is a robust method for single-particle analysis of fluorescent VLPs for determining their size and concentration.",PubMed

The functional role and upstream and downstream regulatory mechanisms of YTHDF1 were examined through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of YTHDF1 in the AD mouse model was evaluated for its therapeutic potential. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the YTHDF1 mRNA level in the skin lesions of AD was significantly higher than that in healthy people. YTHDF1 expression was significantly elevated in AD skin lesions, the DNCB-induced AD mouse model, and primary human keratinocytes and HaCaT cells stimulated with interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13, compared to controls. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that upregulation of YTHDF1 in AD exacerbated cell proliferation and inhibited keratinization by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, which was modulated via the IL-4/IL-13/STAT3 axis. Moreover, topical application of AAV-YTHDF1 significantly improved AD-like lesions in the mouse model. This study identifies YTHDF1 as a contributor to AD pathogenesis by influencing keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation.

Our primary analysis was in chondrocalcinosis, with secondary analysis in crystal arthropathy. We tested for colocalisation of chondrocalcinosis genetic association signals with genetic control of gene expression. There were 2 genome-wide significant loci for chondrocalcinosis in both AFR and EUR cases, both on chromosome 6 (signals within the ENPP1 and RNF144B genes). Findings were supported by analysis of the crystal arthropathy cohort. Colocalisation analysis of chondrocalcinosis genetic association signals with genetic control of gene expression and alternative splicing further supported ENPP1 and RNF144B as candidate casual genes. At ENPP1, the allele that increases the risk for chondrocalcinosis was associated with increased ENPP1 expression. ENPP1 encodes ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 1 (NPP1) that produces adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and inorganic pyrophosphate which, together with calcium ions, leads to the formation of calcium pyrophosphate crystals.

The open pen system exhibited the highest mortality rate (73 ± 4.57 %) and MCRV infection rate (89.04 ± 3.04 %), primarily due to direct contact and cannibalistic behavior among crabs, which facilitated viral transmission. In contrast, the cage-in-pen and external cage systems significantly reduced mortality (18 ± 2.21 % and 19.1 ± 2.88 %, respectively) and MCRV prevalence (64.13 ± 4.35 % and 65.21 ± 3.78 %, respectively) by physically isolating individuals.

Further strains like H5N1, that are not included in the seasonal influenza vaccine, may spill over from animal reservoirs and more significantly impact human health. A broadly acting subunit vaccine can offer protection across multiple strains but would have low immunogenicity without an adjuvant, which are currently limited and require delivery systems to mitigate side effects. Further, antigen delivery can be enhanced with carrier systems to provide dose sparing, and thermostability. This study explores acetalated dextran microparticles (Ace-DEX MPs) encapsulating cGAMP and computational optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) hemagglutinin (HA) proteins, to form a multivalent influenza vaccine. Previous research has shown that Ace-DEX cGAMP MPs with varying degradation kinetics can modulate the immune response. Here, we investigate the effects of mixing MPs with different degradation rates to optimize the immune response. Mice vaccinated with slower-degrading cGAMP MPs exhibited higher IgG2a titers and IL-2 producing splenocytes, while those vaccinated with a mix of fast and slow-degrading cGAMP MPs had the highest IFN-γ producing splenocytes. The protection afforded in mice was also shown in ferrets with a H1, H3 and H5 trivalent COBRA formulation adjuvanted by slow degrading cGAMP MPs. Furthermore, using Ace-DEX MPs encapsulating two broadly reactive COBRA H1 and H3 immunogens in particles with fast and slow degradation rates, co-delivered with cGAMP MPs, resulted in less single antigen dominance when the more dominant antigen was encapsulated in the slowest degrading MP.

Unlike conventional carbon-iron materials (BC[Fe]), sulfur modification stabilized nano-zero-valent iron (Fe<sup>0</sup>) against oxidation and amplified redox activity, achieving an 83 % higher caproate yield (6914 mg·L<sup>-1</sup>) and 58 % carbon conversion efficiency.

Additionally, BC[S-Fe <sup>1/5</sup>] enhanced biofilm formation and quorum sensing, fostering microbial synergy to optimize electron flux.

Unlike conventional carbon-iron materials (BC[Fe]), sulfur modification stabilized nano-zero-valent iron (Fe<sup>0</sup>) against oxidation and amplified redox activity, achieving an 83 % higher caproate yield (6914 mg·L<sup>-1</sup>) and 58 % carbon conversion efficiency. BC[S-Fe <sup>1/5</sup>] (S:Fe = 1:5) outperformed BC, Fe<sup>0</sup> and BC[Fe] by enriching electroactive bacteria (e.g., Rummeliibacillus suwonensis, Seramator thermalis, and Rubeoparvulum massiliense) that upregulated electron transfer genes and CCE metabolic genes. Additionally, BC[S-Fe <sup>1/5</sup>] enhanced biofilm formation and quorum sensing, fostering microbial synergy to optimize electron flux. This work pioneers the integration of sulfur-modified composites into microbial CCE systems, offering a novel strategy to optimize caproate synthesis through enhanced electron transfer and functional microbiome engineering.",PubMed

This study aims to explore the expression patterns and potential sources of residual viral nucleic acids following siRNA treatment in both in vitro and in vivo models, enhancing the understanding of siRNA's antiviral effects. Biochemical methods, combined with immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization techniques, were employed to analyze the antiviral effects of siRNAs targeting the S, X, and C coding regions of HBV at the single-cell level in HBV-infected HepG2-NTCP cell model and rAAV8-HBV1.3 mouse model. The results indicate that, in both the in vitro and in vivo models, a single dose of siRNA treatment did not significantly reduce the proportion of cells positive for any HBV marker. Residual viral antigen and nucleic acid signals were broadly distributed across individual cells. The antiviral effects of siRNA generally exhibit dose-dependent inhibition of HBV, but vary across different viral markers, potentially due to factors such as target region, engagement, and the viral expression patterns within cells, with a potential inhibition plateau for core particle DNA. Furthermore, the combination of siRNA and the HBV core inhibitor GLS4 further reduced intracellular viral DNA in primary human hepatocytes. These findings obtained from experimental models incorporating in situ detection techniques reveal the expression patterns of residual HBV antigens and nucleic acids under siRNA treatment, deepening the understanding of its antiviral effects, while clinical complexities require further investigation.","Small interfering RNA (siRNA) effectively reduces hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigens, but recent clinical trial results indicate that its efficacy and durability remain unsatisfied, warranting further mechanistic investigation.

Between January 2020 to September 2022, all patients admitted to our haematology ward underwent weekly MDR-GNB colonization screening via rectal swabs. A retrospective analysis was performed. MDR-GNB were defined per 2022 ESCMID criteria: (i) third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (3GCephRE), (ii) carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), (iii) Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR), and (iv) carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB). Among 3,024 rectal swabs from 699 patients, 503/3,024 (16.6%) tested positive for MDR-GNB in 192/699 patients (27.5%). The most prevalent organisms were Escherichia coli (248/503; 49.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae complex (125/503; 24.9%), and P. aeruginosa (36/503; 7.2%). A total of 59/503 (11.7%) colonizations of CRE were identified. Overall, 27/192 (14.1%) patients were colonised at admission, primarily by 3GCephRE (27/29; 93.1%). Colonization with CRE and DTR P. aeruginosa was more frequently documented after several days of hospitalization. BSI occurred in 74/192 (38.5%) colonised and 61/507 (12.0%) non-colonised patients. MDR-GNB caused 57/166 BSIs episodes, 50/57 (87.7%) of which were in colonised patients. The unadjusted concordance rate between rectal swab isolates and blood cultures was observed in 43/90 BSIs (47.8%) occurring in colonised patients, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 36.4% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.9% for DTR P. aeruginosa; a PPV of 25.0% and an NPV of 99.9% for CRE; and a PPV of 14.6% and an NPV of 99.0% for 3GCephRE.

This study cloned the 5' flanking promoter region (2010 bp) of the viperin gene (named as LcViperin) in large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) and analyzed its promoter characteristics through bioinformatics and dual-luciferase reporter assays. Results indicated that the LcViperin promoter region contains two TATA boxes and several critical transcription factor binding sites, including interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs), GATA-binding factor 1 (GATA1), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), and signal transduction and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). Promoter region truncation experiments in HEK 293 T cells further confirmed that the core promoter region is located between -331 and - 121 bp. LcViperin overexpression significantly activated IRF3, IRF7, and IFN1 promoters in a dose-dependent manner. Domain deletion experiments demonstrated that the N-terminal and SAM (S-adenosyl-L-methionine) domains play key roles in promoter activation. Additionally, co-transfection with LcViperin and IRAK1 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1, named as LcIRAK1) significantly enhanced IRF3, IRF7, and IFN1 promoter activity. This study reveals the regulatory characteristics of the large yellow croaker viperin promoter and its role in the interferon signaling pathway, providing a theoretical basis for understanding its immune regulatory mechanism and improving disease resistance in large yellow croaker.

10.1016/j.bbamem.2025.184428,Acidic bicelles are a suitable membrane mimic for structural studies of the Lassa virus fusion domain.,"Lassa virus (LASV) is the most prevalent arenavirus afflicting humans and has high pandemic potential. The genetic material of LASV is delivered into the host cell via membrane fusion initiated by the LASV fusion domain (FD). However, the molecular details of the LASV FD, particularly its structure after association with the host cell, remain poorly characterized. This can be attributed to a lack of a viable membrane mimic to effectively stabilize the LASV FD for structural studies. Here, we demonstrate that the structure of the LASV FD widely varies based on the class of membrane mimic. In particular, through CD spectroscopy, we found that the LASV FD required a charged membrane mimic, such as zwitterionic or anionic detergent micelles, to adopt a helical conformation at low pH, but has the highest helical content in the presence of anionic lipids, particularly the detergent micelle LMPG and acidic bicelles. Moreover, we reveal that the LASV FD was well resolved on NMR spectra in CHAPS, DPC, LDAO, LMPG, and acidic bicelles, where LMPG and acidic bicelles had the sharpest peak resolution, but more defined peaks were noted in acidic bicelles over LMPG. In conclusion, our findings indicate that acidic bicelles are the optimal membrane mimic for the stabilization of the LASV FD such that structural studies can be conducted.","Lassa virus (LASV) is the most prevalent arenavirus afflicting humans and has high pandemic potential.

However, the difference of host-pathogen interactions between these two bacteria have not been well defined. In present study, ultrastructural changes, cell cytotoxicity, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptosis, ferroptosis, and transcriptomic profiles induced by P. plecoglossicida and N. seriolae were evaluated in a head kidney originating cell line from yellow large croaker (LYC-hK). Transmission electron microscope showed that both P. plecoglossicida and N. seriolae were able to invade into and multiply intracellularly, but display different intracellular ultrastructural changes upon bacterial infection. Lactate dehydrogenase assay showed that both two bacteria had low cell cytotoxicity toward LYC-hK cell, compared to the cytotoxic positive bacterium, Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae.

However, the functions of teleost IL-15L upon virus infection still remained unknown. In the current study, a homologue of IL-15L from grouper (Epinephelus coioides) was identified and characterized. Sequence analysis indicated that EcIL-15L contained a conserved IL-15 domain (aa 13-134). Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that the expression level of EcIL-15L was markedly increased upon Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) infection, indicating that EcIL-15L may be involved in the host's defense against infections by fish viruses. In addition, EcIL-15L mostly colocalized with endoplasmic reticulum, and partially colocalized with the Golgi apparatus. EcIL-15L overexpression significantly decreased SGIV replication, as demonstrated by a reduce in viral gene transcriptions and protein synthesis. In contrast, the replication of SGIV was promoted by the knockdown of EcIL-15L in grouper cells. Furthermore, compared to SGIV subunit vaccine alone, the combination of vaccine and EcIL-15L significantly improved the relative protective effect against SGIV. Meanwhile, the combination of EcIL-15L significantly increased the specific antibody titer in serum or the transcription levels of immune related genes in vivo, respectively. In conclusion, our findings indicated that EcIL-15L exerted antiviral function against SGIV, and acted as a cytokine adjuvant to improve protective effects induced by SGIV subunit vaccine.","Interleukin (IL) 15 and IL-15-like (IL-15L) are members of the cytokine receptor γ chain (γc) family proteins, which play critical roles in the growth, and differentiation of various cell lineages of the innate and adaptive immune systems.

However, NP does not currently receive effective medications. Engineered exosomes have great potential as drug delivery systems for treating diseases. Here, patch clamp techniques showed that the deficiency of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) subunits 2A and 2B reversed the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) frequency and neuronal excitability in the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (SpVc) after injury, which is an effective therapeutic target for NP. Hence, we successfully employed exosomes (EXOs) modified with the nervous system-specific rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) peptide, which exhibited excellent targeting ability towards N2a-Neuro cells and SpVc tissue. RVG-EXOs loaded with siRNAs of NR2A/B efficiently targeted SpVc neurons, further reducing neuronal excitability and relieving the orofacial NP.

Bietti crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy (BCD) represents a distinct IRD subtype characterized by crystalline deposits in the retina. Although rare in Western populations, BCD ranks among the most prevalent IRDs in East Asia, affecting an estimated 124,000 to 377,000 individuals worldwide. As a severe type of IRD, BCD demonstrates accelerated progression and currently lacks effective treatment. The BCD disease is caused by a biallelic mutation in the CYP4V2 gene. With a coding sequence (CDS) of 1,578bp, CYP4V2 can be effectively encapsulated into adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. As a hydroxylase, CYP4V2 is mainly expressed in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, which can be transduced by AAVs and are suitable for gene augmentation therapy that replaces the function of mutant proteins. Given the large patient population, severe visual impairment, and feasibility of gene therapy, several research groups are interested in developing gene therapy products for BCD, and two products entering Phase III clinical trials have made significant progress. This review outlines the clinical features, genetic insights and pathogenic mechanisms of BCD and discusses the ongoing gene therapy clinical trials, including efficacy and concerns. This knowledge will help us bridge the gap between molecular studies and clinical treatments, facilitating translation from bench to bedside. We believe that advancements in BCD gene therapy will inform the treatment of other IRDs.","Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) comprise a spectrum of disease phenotypes with genetic heterogeneity and clinical phenotypic diversity.

With a coding sequence (CDS) of 1,578bp, CYP4V2 can be effectively encapsulated into adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. As a hydroxylase, CYP4V2 is mainly expressed in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, which can be transduced by AAVs and are suitable for gene augmentation therapy that replaces the function of mutant proteins. Given the large patient population, severe visual impairment, and feasibility of gene therapy, several research groups are interested in developing gene therapy products for BCD, and two products entering Phase III clinical trials have made significant progress. This review outlines the clinical features, genetic insights and pathogenic mechanisms of BCD and discusses the ongoing gene therapy clinical trials, including efficacy and concerns. This knowledge will help us bridge the gap between molecular studies and clinical treatments, facilitating translation from bench to bedside. We believe that advancements in BCD gene therapy will inform the treatment of other IRDs.",PubMed
10.1016/j.envres.2025.122078,Soil alkaline phosphatase-encoding bacteria relate closely to microbial biomass phosphorus in changing environments.,"Microbial biomass phosphorus (P<sub>mb</sub>) is an important P pool and its turnover can supplement the P pool in soil solution promoting plant productivity, and ubiquitously distributed alkaline phosphatase-encoding bacteria (PEB) containing the phoD gene mediate organic P mineralization. Yet, linkage between soil PEB and P<sub>mb</sub> remains poorly understood, particularly in changing environments. Molecular and statistical tools were adopted in both environmental change simulation experiments and a field investigation to unveil the linkage between soil P<sub>mb</sub> and PEB. Simulation experiments revealed that bacterial rather than fungal P<sub>mb</sub> responded significantly to three types of environmental change (i.e., rainfall, acidification/alkalization, and warming), whereby higher P<sub>mb</sub> content and P-cycling gene abundance were found under conditions of low environmental changes than of pronounced environmental changes. P<sub>mb</sub> content was significantly positively correlated with phoD gene abundance in both simulated experiments and the field survey, thereby, specific bacterial genera (e.g., Stenotrophomonas) were notably correlated with P<sub>mb</sub>. According to abundance and presence-absence identification of rare vs. abundant PEB, we found that rare rather than abundant PEB displayed a higher community diversity, closer phylogenetic clustering, stronger environmental restriction, and broader environmental breadth. In contrast, abundant PEB showed stronger species replacement and phylogenetic signals compared to rare ones. Rare and abundant PEB constituted stochasticity-governed community assemblages, and stochastic processes affected community assemblage of abundant PEB more than rare PEB. Our study extends our knowledge on a potential contributor of phoD gene to soil P<sub>mb</sub>, and our findings reveal how rare and abundant PEB remain diverse and respond to changed environments.","Microbial biomass phosphorus (P<sub>mb</sub>) is an important P pool and its turnover can supplement the P pool in soil solution promoting plant productivity, and ubiquitously distributed alkaline phosphatase-encoding bacteria (PEB) containing the phoD gene mediate organic P mineralization.

10.1016/j.envres.2025.122090,Separation of Biogas Residues Alters Digestate Effects on Soil Biological Activity.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of contaminants in residues from biogas production (RBP) on soil microbiological and biochemical properties. The RBP, originating from three biogas plants with different residue treatments, were used in two types: the unseparated fraction and the separated (solid) fraction. The experiment was conducted over a period of 1 or 825 days in pots, adding RBP at a 1% rate. The addition of RBP to the soil stimulated the number of culturable bacteria and fungi (from 12% to 10 times) and enzymatic activity (from 38% to 44 times). In short-term incubation, only phosphatases did not show a statistically significant (P>0.05) change in activity. Separation of the RBP into solid and liquid fractions significantly impacted activity compared to the unseparated material. The total number of culturable bacteria and the number of bacteria participating in the nitrogen transformation cycle were lower (from 1.2 to 10 times), while the number of fungi and the enzymatic activity were higher (from 1.5 to 6.5 times) for separated RBP in comparison to unseparated materials. A significant relationship between the number of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in the amended soil and the content of PAHs was also observed. As far as the long-term incubation of RBP with the soil is concerned, it was found that PAHs (P≤0.05) and Cr (P≤0.05) present in RBP had an inhibiting impact on activity of dehydrogenases and urease, respectively, whereas light PAHs (P≤0.05) were found to have a positive effect on the activity of alkaline phosphatase as well as on the number of fungi and bacteria.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of contaminants in residues from biogas production (RBP) on soil microbiological and biochemical properties.

10.1016/j.yexcr.2025.114641,SLAMF7-Mediated Macrophage Polarization Dysregulation: A Novel Mechanism in Pneumonia.,"Bacterial pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite advances in antibiotic therapy, treatment outcomes remain suboptimal due to increased pathogen resistance and dysregulated host immune responses. Macrophage polarization plays a crucial role in pulmonary inflammation, and its dysregulation can lead to uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Although SLAM family member 7 (SLAMF7) is recognized as an important immunomodulatory molecule in various immune diseases, its role and molecular mechanism in bacterial pneumonia remain unclear. We established a bacterial pneumonia mouse model and specifically suppressed SLAMF7 expression via adeno-associated virus-mediated gene silencing. Macrophage polarization was analyzed by flow cytometry, inflammatory cytokine levels were measured by ELISA, and pathological changes in lung tissue were evaluated by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining. Primary alveolar macrophages were isolated and cultured in vitro to examine SLAMF7 expression and its effects on macrophage polarization by western blotting, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence staining. The Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway was specifically blocked using small-molecule inhibitors to verify its role in SLAMF7-mediated macrophage polarization. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software, with statistical significance set at P<0.05. SLAMF7 expression was significantly upregulated in the bacterial pneumonia model. SLAMF7 knockout attenuates bacteria-induced lung injury and improves survival in mice Silencing SLAMF7 significantly inhibited pulmonary macrophage polarization toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. Mechanistic studies revealed that SLAMF7 promoted M1 polarization while suppressing M2 polarization through the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. In vitro experiments confirmed that SLAMF7 specifically induces M1 polarization without affecting macrophage proliferation and migration. NF-κB inhibition reverses SLAMF7-induced M1 macrophage polarization. In vivo, blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway significantly ameliorated the SLAMF7-mediated exacerbation of pneumonia. This study revealed a novel SLAMF7-NF-κB-macrophage polarization axis in bacterial pneumonia and demonstrated that SLAMF7 promotes M1 macrophage polarization through NF-κB pathway activation, thereby exacerbating pulmonary inflammation. These findings not only expand our understanding of immune cell polarization regulatory mechanisms but also provide a theoretical basis for developing novel immunotherapeutic strategies targeting SLAMF7. Future studies should explore the upstream regulatory mechanisms of SLAMF7 and evaluate the clinical potential of SLAMF7-targeted therapeutic strategies.","Bacterial pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Acanthamoeba parasites can be isolated from contact lenses, cleaning solutions, ventilation systems, dental treatment units, dialysis units, and emergency showers. Since the genus Acanthamoeba can lead to dangerous infectious diseases in immunocompromised patients, monitoring medical centers and hospitals admitting these patients, who are more susceptible to these infections, is of great importance. This study aimed to isolate, analyze, and characterize Acanthamoeba strains obtained from high-risk medical centers in Khorramabad city, western Iran, using parasitological (culture and microscopic examination) and molecular (LAMP, PCR, and sequencing) methods. In this study, 53 dust samples were collected from four high-risk healthcare facilities in Khorramabad City, Western Iran. After being transferred to the laboratory, the samples were cultured in a non-nutritive agar culture medium, and samples with positive cultures were selected for molecular analysis. PCR and LAMP molecular methods targeting 18srRNA gene-specific primers were used to analyze the samples. For molecular confirmation and determination of Acanthamoeba genotypes, 4 randomly selected samples of PCR products were sequenced. The data was analyzed by SPSS-21 software. The culture and microscopic examination showed that 31 out of 53 samples (58.5%) collected from high-risk healthcare facilities were positive for the Acanthamoeba parasite. All the positive samples by the culture method were also positive in the PCR assay. Out of 53 examined samples, 26 were positive by the LAMP technique regarding the presence of the Acanthamoeba parasite. Sequencing results of 4 sequenced samples showed T4 genotypes, Acanthamoeba sp., and Acanthamoeba culbertsoni. The present study showed that the environment of high-risk healthcare facilities in Khorramabad city is contaminated with Acanthamoeba, and the pathogenic T4 genotype is present among the positive samples. Given the severe health implications of Acanthamoeba infections, educating immunocompromised patients about transmission routes and effective preventive measures is crucial. This would help raise awareness and promote safety protocols in healthcare facilities to avoid contamination.","Acanthamoeba is one of the most common environmental protozoans with a global distribution.

Cabergoline can be used to suppress physiologic lactation in people choosing not to breastfeed. Cabergoline was added to the postpartum order set in our institution's electronic medical record in December 2020. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether this intervention improved cabergoline ordering and administration. A retrospective chart review was performed to assess sociodemographic and medical characteristics, as well as cabergoline ordering and administration, for births among people living with HIV pre- (November 2018-December 2020) and post-intervention (December 2020-August 2022). Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test, paired samples t-test, Mann-Whitney test, and Quade ANCOVA. Eighty-four births were included, with n = 55 occurring in the pre-intervention period and n = 29 occurring post-intervention. Prior to amending the electronic order set, cabergoline was administered following 40 of 48 qualifying births (83%), compared with 19/21 (91%) post-intervention. The median time between birth and cabergoline administration was 257 minutes for the pre-intervention group compared with 157 minutes post-intervention (P = 0.032 Mann-Whitney, P = 0.064 Quade ANCOVA). Cabergoline was administered in over three quarters of births, both in pre- and post-intervention groups. For both groups, administration was timely. Once cabergoline was added to the order set, time between birth and administration decreased by nearly 40% and ordering compliance may have improved. Our findings suggest that electronic order sets may be effective for streamlining clinical processes, especially among populations in which medical management may be overlooked.","In Canada, exclusive formula feeding is recommended for infant feeding among persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

In March to May 2022, March to April 2023, and January to April 2024, crow die-offs were reported in an urban garden in Hokkaido, Japan, raising suspicions of HPAIV infection. Since August 2022, all dead carcasses were investigated for HPAIV detection and isolation. Phylogenetic analysis of the H5 hemagglutinin gene revealed that all detected HPAIVs belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b, a dominant lineage in Hokkaido since early 2022. Two distinct subgroups were identified: G2d (in 2022-2024) and G2a (in 2024). A maximum clade credibility tree, based on concatenated nucleotide sequences of the isolates, suggested that multiple distinct types of HPAIVs were introduced into the garden in rotation during the winters of 2022-2023 and 2023-2024. Infectious HPAIVs were isolated not only from the lungs and brains but also from the rectal contents of the dead crows, with no apparent difference in viral titers between the two subgroups. The case reproduction numbers of HPAIV infection in the crow flock ranged from 0.52 and 1.57 in the spring of 2022 and from 0.55 to 1.78 in the spring of 2023, suggesting that the contiguous HPAIV infections in the crows were due to multiple introductions into the flock.

The bacterial community on the surface of MPD was analyzed using 16S rDNA metabarcoding. The abundance of PPB among the attached bacteria was significantly higher than in the surrounding seawater (PERMANOVA, p < 0.001).

Vibrio splendidus and Pseudoalteromonas nigrifaciens thrived under eutrophic conditions below 17 °C. In contrast, Vibrio parahaemolyticus appeared more frequently at temperatures above 17 °C, with lower eutrophic conditions.

Herein, we aimed to (i) optimize the flow virometry (FVM) protocol for use in wastewater matrices, (ii) correlate FVM data with specific virus genera of interest, and (iii) develop machine learning (ML) models for determining total VP concentration. We identified and tested a comprehensive set of parameters to determine the optimal conditions for wastewater FVM. Specifically, we tested various sample preprocessing steps to enhance FVM detection sensitivity, including the use of different nucleic acid staining dyes, surfactant addition and concentration optimization, glutaraldehyde fixation, and the effect of sample freezing before FVM analysis. Spearman's rank correlation of FVM data with virus genera concentration using a conventional qPCR-based method in 206 samples showed a positive correlation for all five virus genera, ranging from 0.21 to 0.44 (p < 0.01). The extreme gradient-boosting (XGB) model using easily accessible physiochemical water parameters (such as turbidity, electroconductivity, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, pH, chemical oxygen demand, and concentrations of nitrate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, and ammonium nitrogen) as input data outperformed the random forest (RF) model and can be used to estimate total virus count across all types of wastewater matrices as output data. Furthermore, XGB achieved a better root mean square error in the four treatment processes (influent, aerobic, sand, and MBR) by a mean of 23 % than RF in model development. This study demonstrates that FVM, combined with ML, can significantly enhance monitoring capabilities by accurately estimating VP concentrations across diverse wastewater matrices.","Enumerating virus particles (VPs) at different stages of the wastewater treatment process or along the distribution network is essential for ensuring high performance and reducing public health risks.

Detection of live S. maltophilia and S. sonnei was achieved within 2 h as Resazurin, reduced to Resorufin by metabolically active bacteria, produced a measurable decrease in the reduction current. Following exposure to antibiotics (levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ampicillin), changes in Resazurin's reduction current were monitored using Differential Pulse Voltammetry. Susceptible bacteria exhibited minimal changes in current, while resistant strains actively reduced Resazurin, lowering the current. This sensor provided results within 4-5 h, aligning with traditional methods like disk diffusion and broth microdilution but with improved speed and operational simplicity.

We investigated the occurrence, risk factors and molecular characterization of this pathogen in 240 live bats sampled in northern, central, and southern areas of Spain during 2020-2021. Blood DNA samples from 22 bat species of Miniopteridae, Vespertilionidae and Rhinolophidae were analyzed using PCR assays and Sanger sequencing. The results showed a Bartonella spp. prevalence of 17.1 % (41/240), with at least one positive individual in 13 bat species of six genera. Miniopterus schreibersii showed the highest prevalence (40.5 %; 95 % CI: 24.7-56.4), and to the authors' knowledge, Bartonella spp. is reported for the first time in Barbastella barbastellus, Nyctalus lasiopterus and Nyctalus leisleri.

Therefore, we studied the oligo- and polymeric products formed by recombinant dextransucrases from Ligilactobacillus animalis TMW 1.971 (LaniDSΔN), Limosilactobacillus reuteri TMW 1.106 (LreuDSΔN), and Steptococcus salivarius DSM 20560 (SSAL4550) from 0.25 M and 1.5 M sucrose solutions (with and without 1 M glucose) in detail. After incubation of the sucrose solutions, the enzymes mainly elongated sucrose with 1,6-linked glucose units. Erlose and leucrose were identified as additional low molecular weight compounds in the sucrose solutions, whereas glucose addition led to the predominant abundance of isomalto-oligosaccharides and kojibiose. HPSEC analysis demonstrated that glucose addition also influenced the molecular weight of the dextrans produced by LaniDSΔN and SSAL4550. To evaluate which products were used as an acceptor molecule for polysaccharide formation, the products obtained from endo-dextranase hydrolysis of borohydride reduced dextrans were isolated, characterized, and quantified. The quantification of glucitol-containing and theanderose-containing low molecular weight products demonstrated that sucrose and glucose are used as acceptors for dextran formation, whereas erlose or kojibiose are not elongated. At high glucose concentrations, glucose is mostly found at the non-reducing end of the dextran chain.

Its therapeutic activity is primarily exerted under low-oxygen conditions, wherein the nitro functional group undergoes enzymatic reduction, leading to the cleavage of the imidazole ring and the generation of cytotoxic intermediates. Despite its effectiveness, the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance has prompted the design of new metronidazole analogs, including ruthenium-based compounds and Schiff base derivatives. These next-generation agents exhibit broader antimicrobial coverage, alternative mechanisms of action, reduced cytotoxicity, improved efficacy against resistant strains, and potential applications beyond traditional infectious disease contexts. This review provides an in-depth analysis of metronidazole's clinical relevance, emphasizing the relationship between metabolite structure and cytotoxic effects in both human and rodent models. Additionally, it highlights recent advances in the synthesis of metronidazole derivatives and evaluates their comparative therapeutic benefits relative to the original compound.","Metronidazole, a prodrug derived from the nitroimidazole class, continues to serve as a key antimicrobial agent for managing infections caused by anaerobic bacteria, microaerophilic organisms, and protozoan parasites.

10.1093/g3journal/jkaf131,Human xenobiotic metabolism proteins have full-length and split homologs in the gut microbiome.,"Xenobiotics, including pharmaceutical drugs, can be metabolized by both host and microbiota, in some cases by homologous enzymes. We conducted a systematic search for all known human proteins with gut microbial homologs. Because gene fusion and fission can obscure homology detection, we built a pipeline to identify not only full-length homologs, but also cases where microbial homologs were split across multiple adjacent genes in the same neighborhood or operon (""split homologs""). We found that human proteins with full-length gut microbial homologs disproportionately participate in xenobiotic metabolism. While this included many different enzyme classes, short-chain and aldo-keto reductases were the most frequently detected, especially in prevalent gut microbes, while cytochrome P450 homologs were largely restricted to lower-prevalence facultative anaerobes. In contrast, human proteins with split homologs tended to play roles in central metabolism, especially of nucleobase-containing compounds. We identify twelve specific drugs that gut microbial split homologs may metabolize; two of these, 6-mercaptopurine by xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) and 5-fluorouracil by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD), have been recently confirmed in mouse models. This work provides a comprehensive map of homology between the human and gut microbial proteomes, indicates which human xenobiotic enzyme classes are most likely to be shared by gut microorganisms, and finally demonstrates that split homology may be an underappreciated explanation for microbial contributions to drug metabolism.","Xenobiotics, including pharmaceutical drugs, can be metabolized by both host and microbiota, in some cases by homologous enzymes.

Efficacy data came from clinical trials, and costs were based on 2023 data from an exit survey of 94 inpatients and 464 outpatients in Bach Mai hospital. Other clinical data were also sourced from CHB patients at Bach Mai hospital. Along with deterministic analysis, two-way sensitivity analysis, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, threshold, and budget impact analysis were performed.ResultsCompared to TDF, TAF yielded an additional cost of USD 3,983 and an additional QALY gained of 0.14, resulting in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of USD 32,090 per QALY gained. The ICER exceeds the cost-effective threshold of three-time gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, that is, USD 11,348, by 2.8 times. According to one-way sensitivity analysis, ICERs were driven mainly by transition probabilities and TDF/ TAF prices.

The SFTS virus (SFTSV) is transmitted to various hosts, including humans, through tick bites, leading to high fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, with a high case fatality rate (up to 30%) due to multiple organ dysfunction. Therefore, early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and preventing disease transmission. In this study, we aimed to develop and characterize monoclonal antibodies targeting the SFTSV nucleocapsid protein (NP). We generated recombinant NP to screen antibodies against SFTSV. Using phage display technology, we identified candidate single-chain variable fragment (scFv) sequences capable of detecting SFTSV NP. Five human IgG antibodies and six chimeric mouse antibodies exhibited strong binding ability to the recombinant NP. Furthermore, their specificity and selectivity were evaluated against NPs from different subtypes and other viral species. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to determine optimal antibody pairings for SFTSV detection. The mP01A05/hP01C09, mP01A05/hP01B10, and mP02E04/hP01A05 antibody pairs demonstrated high efficacy in diagnosing SFTSV infections. These findings provide valuable antibody resources and establish an effective platform for the diagnosis of SFTS. KEY POINTS: • Monoclonal antibodies targeting SFTSV NP were developed using phage display technology. • Candidate antibodies showed strong binding ability and high specificity to SFTSV NP. • Optimized antibody pairs enabled effective SFTSV detection via sandwich ELISA.","Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging viral infectious disease caused by a novel Bandavirus in the family Phenuiviridae.

In this study, we aimed to develop and characterize monoclonal antibodies targeting the SFTSV nucleocapsid protein (NP). We generated recombinant NP to screen antibodies against SFTSV. Using phage display technology, we identified candidate single-chain variable fragment (scFv) sequences capable of detecting SFTSV NP. Five human IgG antibodies and six chimeric mouse antibodies exhibited strong binding ability to the recombinant NP. Furthermore, their specificity and selectivity were evaluated against NPs from different subtypes and other viral species. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to determine optimal antibody pairings for SFTSV detection. The mP01A05/hP01C09, mP01A05/hP01B10, and mP02E04/hP01A05 antibody pairs demonstrated high efficacy in diagnosing SFTSV infections. These findings provide valuable antibody resources and establish an effective platform for the diagnosis of SFTS. KEY POINTS: • Monoclonal antibodies targeting SFTSV NP were developed using phage display technology. • Candidate antibodies showed strong binding ability and high specificity to SFTSV NP. • Optimized antibody pairs enabled effective SFTSV detection via sandwich ELISA.",PubMed
10.1007/s00284-025-04303-0,Differential Microbial Composition and Fiber Degradation in Two Sloth Species (Bradypus variegatus and Choloepus hoffmanni).,"Sloths have the slowest digestion among mammals, requiring 5-20 times longer to digest food than other herbivores, which suggests differences in their gut microbiota, particularly in plant-fiber-degrading microorganisms. Bradypus variegatus has a lower metabolic rate and moves less than Choloepus hoffmanni. However, no comprehensive studies have compared the microbiota (e.g., fungi) of these species. We hypothesized that differences in digestion and metabolism between the two species would be reflected in their microbiota composition and functionality, which we characterized using metagenomics, metabarcoding, and cellulose degradation. Results revealed significant differences in microbiota composition and functionality. Both species are dominated by bacteria; fungi comprised only 0.06-0.5% of metagenomic reads. Neocallimastigomycota, an anaerobic fungus involved in fiber breakdown in other herbivores, was found in low abundance, especially in B. variegatus. Bacterial communities showed subtle differences: C. hoffmanni was dominated by Bacillota and Bacteroidota, while B. variegatus showed higher Actinomycetota. Expected herbivore bacterial taxa (e.g., Fibrobacter and Prevotella) were scarce. Functional analysis showed a low abundance of carbohydrate-active enzymes essential for polysaccharide breakdown. Cellulose degradation assays confirmed that sloths digest only ~ 3-30% of ingested plant material. This research sheds light on the potential multidirectional links between the gut microbiota, metabolism, and digestion.","Sloths have the slowest digestion among mammals, requiring 5-20 times longer to digest food than other herbivores, which suggests differences in their gut microbiota, particularly in plant-fiber-degrading microorganisms.

10.1111/apt.70224,Factors Associated With Underutilization of Antiviral Therapy in Preventing Hepatitis B Virus-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Deaths from hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are projected to increase through 2030. Underutilisation of antiviral therapy may contribute to this concerning trend but empirical data remain sparse. We aimed to assess the frequency of missed opportunities for antiviral therapy before HBV-related HCC development and to investigate factors associated with non-treatment. We analysed the electronic medical records from a large healthcare group in Taiwan to identify all HBV-infected patients who developed HCC between 1 April 2004 and 24 May 2022. HBV infection was confirmed by hepatitis B surface antigen seropositivity and incident HCC was verified through the cancer registry. Patients were grouped based on whether they had received antiviral therapy prior to the HCC diagnosis. Among 1017 patients with HBV-related HCC (median age, 60.8 years; 80.1% male; 42.9% with cirrhosis), 75% had not received antiviral therapy before developing HCC. Compared to treated patients, the untreated group had a significantly lower proportion of cirrhosis (33.5% vs. 71.0%), higher platelet counts, elevated liver enzyme levels, and higher viral loads. They also had significantly fewer specialist visits (median frequency, 0.3 vs. 3.6 visits per year) and biomarker evaluations, and were less frequently diagnosed at early stages (Stage I/II, 49.5% vs. 81.6%) with a significantly shorter median survival (2.1 vs. 4.4 years). Three-quarters of patients who developed HBV-related HCC had not received antiviral therapy before HCC diagnosis. These patients were characterised by a lower proportion of cirrhosis, infrequent clinical visits, fewer HBV evaluations, more advanced HCC stage, and poorer prognosis.","Deaths from hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are projected to increase through 2030.

In this study, we have developed a photochromic chitosan-Azo-Schiff base using condensation reactions of chitosan with three derivatives of azobenzene. The biopolymers thus produced were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The results showed that the materials had good thermal stability, an amorphous nature, and belt-like morphology.

ZnO-NPs were produced by a coprecipitation method and characterized by several techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-VIS spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the ZnO-NPs presented uniform spheroidal morphology with open porosity, allowing an efficient methylene blue (MB) encapsulation without significant structural changes, ensuring stability and the absence of aggregation. The PS was adsorbed on the porous surface of the ZnO nanoparticles, characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and steady-state analysis techniques.

The biological activity was evaluated in vitro using the trypan blue exclusion method in macrophages infected with <i>Leishmania braziliensis</i>. After loading with the photosensitizer, they maintained their photophysical properties, ensuring the proper location of the dye within the cells. In vitro assays demonstrated the internalization of ZnO/MB-NPs by infected macrophages and a significant reduction in parasite viability after light activation.

10.1186/s40793-025-00720-7,Severe drought impacts tree traits and associated soil microbial communities of clonal oaks.,"Biotic and abiotic factors, including plant age, soil pH, soil organic matter concentration, and especially water availability, significantly influence soil microbial populations and plant characteristics. While many ecosystems are adapted to occasional droughts, climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of drought events, which negatively impacts plant productivity and survival. Long-lived, drought-sensitive tree species such as Quercus robur are particularly vulnerable to water shortages. Drought also alters soil microbial communities, reducing and reshaping microbial diversity, biomass, and activity, which can in turn disrupt key ecosystem functions. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of natural drought conditions on soil physicochemical variables, plant traits and microbial communities of the oak clone DF159 in Central Germany. Our research focuses on two study sites, Bad Lauchstädt and Kreinitz, which differ in soil water retention capacity. Data collection spans two periods: before and after a severe drought in 2018. Oak traits and environmental data was collected from 2011 to 2023 covering two oak time series with trees planted annually between 2010 and 2019. Microbial communities were analyzed every second year between 2015 and 2021 around trees representing five different ages. We found that plant traits, including apical growth, branch elongation and number of shoot flushes, were positively correlated with precipitation and relative humidity. Although the study sites differed in oak leaf number per shoot flush and number of shoot flushes, the 2018 drought negatively impacted all measured plant traits, regardless of sites. Soil bacterial richness and diversity declined at both study sites, independent of plant age, while fungal richness specifically increased in Bad Lauchstädt, which has a higher water-holding capacity, following the drought event. Bacterial community composition was more strongly affected by drought than fungal communities, whereas the latter was more responsive to plant age than bacterial communities. Given their strong functional links during drought, interactions among vegetation, microbial communities, and soil functioning may ultimately influence major ecosystem services. Bacterial communities were particularly sensitive to drought, while fungal communities exhibited greater resistance, suggesting their potential role in supporting plant survival under drought stress. These findings highlight the risk that prolonged drought may cause irreversible shifts in microbial communities, with significant implications for soil functions and plant-microbe interactions.","Biotic and abiotic factors, including plant age, soil pH, soil organic matter concentration, and especially water availability, significantly influence soil microbial populations and plant characteristics.

While horizontal transmission of RVA among pig populations is well documented, the possibility of vertical transmission from sows to newborn piglets has not been definitively confirmed. In this study, piglet testicles, umbilical cord blood, and colostrum were collected from porcine RVA (PoRVA)-active farms for analysis. The samples presented high PoRVA-positive rates, with 70.00% in the testicle samples, 55.00% in the umbilical cord blood samples, and 73.33% in the colostrum samples. Immunohistochemical assays confirmed the presence of PoRVA in neonatal piglet testicles. Additionally, two PoRVA strains, RVA/Pig/CHN/QT/2023/G9P [23] (QT2023) and RVA/Pig/CHN/BH/2023/G12P [7] (BH2023), were isolated from newborn piglet testicles. Complete genome analyses revealed that strains QT2023 and BH2023 both presented a Wa-like backbone, with the genotype constellation of G9-P [23]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1 and G12-P [7]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1, respectively. While strains QT2023 and BH2023 originated from PoRVAs, sequence identities and phylogenetic analyses suggested close relationships with human rotaviruses in specific genes. Furthermore, successful viral replication of these strains in MA-104 cells was observed. Inoculation of PoRVA-negative piglets with strains QT2023 and BH2023 resulted in clinical diarrhea, fecal virus shedding, and intestinal pathological changes, highlighting the pathogenicity of these strains. This study provides evidence that PoRVA can breach the placental barrier and spread to newborn piglets through vertical transmission. These discoveries enhance our understanding of the transmission route of porcine RVA and have the potential to guide the development of efficient vaccine strategies for combating this disease.","Porcine group A rotavirus (RVA) is a significant causative agent of diarrhea in piglets, leading to substantial economic losses in pig farms worldwide.

Complete genome analyses revealed that strains QT2023 and BH2023 both presented a Wa-like backbone, with the genotype constellation of G9-P [23]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1 and G12-P [7]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1, respectively. While strains QT2023 and BH2023 originated from PoRVAs, sequence identities and phylogenetic analyses suggested close relationships with human rotaviruses in specific genes. Furthermore, successful viral replication of these strains in MA-104 cells was observed. Inoculation of PoRVA-negative piglets with strains QT2023 and BH2023 resulted in clinical diarrhea, fecal virus shedding, and intestinal pathological changes, highlighting the pathogenicity of these strains. This study provides evidence that PoRVA can breach the placental barrier and spread to newborn piglets through vertical transmission. These discoveries enhance our understanding of the transmission route of porcine RVA and have the potential to guide the development of efficient vaccine strategies for combating this disease.",PubMed

While extensive data on COVID-19 is available from high-income countries, information remains scarce in lower-income regions, particularly regarding its impact on pregnant women. This study aims to evaluate the burden of COVID-19 among pregnant women and its effects on maternal and birth outcomes during the third wave in Benin. A cross-sectional, hospital-based survey was conducted from May 19 to September 19, 2022, at the Lagune Mother and Child Teaching Hospital. A standardized questionnaire was administered, and nasal swabs along with serological analysis were performed on 437 pregnant women. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess risk factors and evaluate the impact of previous or current COVID-19 exposure on maternal and birth adverse outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in less than 1% of pregnant women through PCR testing of nasal swab samples. Among the study population, 14.4% of women were vaccinated against COVID-19. A total of 81.1% of women tested positive for antibodies, suggesting prior exposure or infection to SARS-CoV-2 or vaccination. Notably, 78.6% of unvaccinated women had detectable antibodies, which serves as a more accurate proxy for infection prevalence. No significant association was found between prior COVID-19 exposure and adverse maternal and birth outcomes (aOR: 0.48, 95% CI 0.15-1.51). Although PCR testing revealed a low incidence of active SARS-CoV-2 infection, the high prevalence of IgG antibodies among pregnant women suggests widespread prior exposure or infection. Vaccination was identified as a strong predictor of detectable IgG antibodies. Notably, despite the presence of antibodies, no significant association was found between prior COVID-19 exposure and adverse maternal or birth outcomes. These findings highlight the need for further research to explore the potential long-term effects of COVID-19 infection on pregnancy outcomes and to better understand the relationship between antibody presence and maternal and fetal health.","SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has emerged as a significant global public health challenge, revealing critical vulnerabilities within health systems worldwide.

10.1186/s12936-025-05430-6,Effects of Plasmodium berghei infection on the expression of salivary gland immune-related genes in the Anopheles stephensi mosquito.,"Achieving malaria eradication by 2050 will require the development of novel transmission-blocking strategies alongside existing and emerging control measures. Since the innate immune responses of Anopheles salivary glands determine its vectorial capacity, a detailed assessment of vector-parasite interactions could help identify novel targets that play key roles in the immune response against Plasmodium. In this study, six candidate immune-related genes from Anopheles stephensi salivary gland transcriptomic datasets were selected, and their expression changes were assessed following Plasmodium berghei infection. Using RT-qPCR, gene expression profiles at 18 days (early phase) and 21 days (late phase) post-infection were analysed, and the results were compared with those of uninfected mosquitoes. A significant upregulation of LRIM8A and DEF1 gene expression was observed at both time points, whereas TEP-12 expression was significantly increased only at day 21. However, no significant changes were observed for P37NB, CLIPA4, and CLIPC4. Among the highly expressed genes, LRIM8A exhibited the highest expression during both the early and later phases of salivary gland infection. The highest expression levels of LRIM8A at both early and late phases of salivary gland infection underscore its potential as a key immune effector. However, further functional assays are required to validate the role of LRIM8A in mosquito innate immunity. A deeper understanding of the immune mechanisms in Anopheles following Plasmodium infection could contribute to the development of novel malaria control strategies.","Achieving malaria eradication by 2050 will require the development of novel transmission-blocking strategies alongside existing and emerging control measures.

This study aimed to identify the types and prevalence of parasitic diseases among transplant patients at a comprehensive transplant center in Fars Province, southern Iran. The subjects of the study were 150 organ transplant recipients (kidney, liver, intestine, simultaneous pancreas and kidney [SPK]) who were at least two months post-transplantation. Stool samples were collected from each participant, and demographics along with clinical features were recorded. The stool samples underwent parasitological examination, including direct examination, zinc sulfate flotation, formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation, trichrome, and acid-fast staining to detect protozoan and helminthic infections. Samples positive for Blastocystis sp., as well as all diarrheal samples suspected of having microsporidia or intestinal coccidia, were further investigated using molecular methods. Sequencing was performed on the PCR products obtained from 10 Blastocystis samples. The resulting sequences were submitted to the Blastocystis 18 S database for GenBank sequence queries. The mean age of the participants was 46.24 (± 15.13), ranging from 18 to 85 years. Among the 150 subjects, 96 (64%) were male and 54 (36%) were female. The majority had undergone kidney transplantation (52.66%), followed by liver transplantation (46%). The participants resided in various provinces of Iran, with the majority (61.33%) living in Fars province. Overall, 63 (42%) individuals were found to be infected with at least one type of intestinal parasite. Blastocystis sp., the most commonly detected parasite, was detected in 58 (38.66%) cases, Entamoeba coli and Iodamoeba butchlii were each detected in 2 (1.33%) cases, while Enterocytozoon bieneusi was identified in 1 (0.66%) case. No helminth infections were detected in any of the subjects. Sequencing of Blastocystis sp. revealed subtype 3 (ST3). The study highlights a high prevalence of intestinal protozoa, particularly Blastocystis sp., among transplant recipients in southern Iran. The detection of E. bieneusi underscores the critical need for greater awareness of these parasitic agents, especially in cases presenting with diarrhea.","Individuals with compromised immune systems, such as organ transplant recipients who are on immunosuppressive therapy to prevent graft rejection, are at an increased risk of acquiring, disseminating, or experiencing recurrence parasitic infections.

Here, we describe zinc-doped curcumin carbon dots (CCDs) as a novel nanoscale photosensitizer, which was applied in photodynamic therapy (PDT) to promote infected wound healing by modulating various cellular functions. The PDT generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) effectively inactivates the source of infection without drug resistance, effectively inhibiting the propagation of bacteria and the spread of inflammation in the wound. In addition, CCDs have the ability to promote cell proliferation and extension, accelerate blood vessel formation and collagen deposition, and significantly improve wound healing efficiency by modulating the VEGF signaling pathway. These features create a favorable environment for skin regeneration and synergistically accelerate infected wound healing. We believe it has great potential to address antibiotic misuse and effectively manage infected wounds.","Management of bacterial infected wounds remains challenging due to the open, susceptibility to infection and delayed healing characteristics of damaged wounds, and there is an urgent need for non-antibiotic-based wound healing strategies.

This excessive increase of adipose tissue is a risk factor for the development of multiple diseases and premature death. Amongst associated diseases, metabolic syndrome is one of the main comorbidities of obesity. In this context, the gut microbiota has been recognized as both shaping and responding to host energy metabolism. Recently metabolomics has emerged as a powerful tool to capture a snapshot of the metabolites present in a specific tissue, providing new insights into host-microbiota interactions. Integrating metabolomics with gut microbiota studies could help us better understand how specific species impact on host metabolomic profile. Dysosmobacter welbionis has been identified as a promising next generation beneficial bacteria with potential effects on fat mass and glucose metabolism in mice, and fecal Dysosmobacter spp. concentration was inversely correlated to body mass index fasting glucose and plasmatic HbA1c in humans. Concentration of Dysosmobacter spp. was quantified by qPCR in the stools of insulin resistant overweight/obese participants with a metabolic syndrome and plasma metabolites were analyzed using untargeted metabolomics. Correlations between Dysosmobacter spp. fecal abundance and the 1169 identified plasma metabolites were uncovered using Spearman correlations followed by a false discovery rate correction. Interestingly, among the detected metabolites, Dysosmobacter spp. was exclusively associated with lipid molecules. Fecal concentration of Dysosmobacter spp. was positively associated with plasmatic levels of five phosphatidylcholines, arachidonate, two monoacylglycerols, twelve diacylglycerols, three lysophosphatidylethanolamines, one phosphatidylinositol and three lysophosphatidylinositols, as well as glycerophosphoethanolamines, glycerophosphatidylcholine and PC(P-16:0). The correlation was particularly interesting with acylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine metabolites as, respectively, 6/8 and 8/10 detected molecules were positively associated with Dysosmobacter spp. These results suggest that Dysosmobacter spp. plays a specific role in host lipid metabolism. This finding aligns with previous in vivo studies highlighting lipid profile alterations in multiple tissues of mice treated with this bacterium.

Previous studies have shown that plant essential oils (EOs) could be valuable anthelmintic agents, due to their numerous advantages. The present study aimed to evaluate the possibility of using winter savory (Satureja montana L.) EO against sheep GINs. The chemical composition of the tested oil was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The efficacy of the tested oil was determined in vitro using the egg hatch test (EHT), and in vivo using the faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) performed in two farms. Preliminary toxicity studies including clinical observation, haematological and biochemical blood analysis were also performed to evaluate the safety of the tested oil to the hosts. In addition, a coproculture study was carried out in the tested farms using the appropriate morphological keys. Main compounds of the S. montana oil identified by GC-MS analysis were p-cymene (42.8%), carvacrol (28.1%) and y-terpinene (14.6%). The in vitro EHT showed a dose-dependent (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.94) anthelmintic potential of the tested oil, with ovicidal activity varying from 17.0-83.3% and determined IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.59 mg/ml. The field efficacy reached 33% (at group level) and 50% (at individual level) at D14 after treatment. In vivo efficacy was significantly higher in farm 2 (FEC above 65% at group level, p < 0.05) where sheep were kept in pens during treatment. No toxic effects were observed, either in the physical observation of the test animals or in their liver and kidney function. No significant changes (p > 0.05) in the percentage representation of GIN genera were observed in the coproculture study, indicating that the treatment agent was not specific to a single genus. The anthelmintic potential showed on EHT and FECRT, without adverse effects on the sheep, suggests that S. montana EO is suitable for the control of sheep GINs as part of an integrated parasite management. However, further studies should be conducted to increase efficacy in field conditions.","The increasing difficulties in combating anthelmintic resistance in gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) of sheep worldwide, and the residues of chemical drugs in animal products and the environment, necessitate the search for alternatives.

We compared the incidence rates of HPV types in the HAVANA cohort (follow-up from 2010/2011 until 2015/2016) with those from the HAVANA-2 cohort (2017-2022) using two regression approaches to estimate the indirect effect of HPV vaccination. First, we calculated the incidence ratio (IRR) for a vaccine or cross-protective type in HAVANA-2 versus HAVANA by Poisson regression and compared it to the IRR for a non-cross-protective type. The indirect vaccine effect is defined as 1-ratio of the IRRs. Second, we performed Cox regression with infection by vaccine or cross-protective type as the endpoint and calculated the hazard ratio (HR) for HAVANA-2 versus HAVANA after adjusting for time-varying sociodemographic variables.

Mozambique is located in a region that is prone to climate change-related devastation, including heavy rainfalls and severe droughts that favor the emergence of zoonotic viruses transmitted by arthropods such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (Orthonairovirus haemorrhagiae, CCHFV) and Rift Valley fever virus (Phlebovirus riftense, RVFV). Both viruses are closely associated with livestock farming, including cattle, and can cause symptoms of hemorrhagic fever in humans. Available previous data sets related to the presence of RVFV and especially CCHFV in Mozambique are rather scarce. Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate the recent seroprevalence of both viruses in cattle in four localities of Limpopo National Park. In addition, ticks were collected and tested for the presence of different arboviruses. A total of 460 cattle blood samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of CCHFV and RVFV antibodies using ID Screen CCHF Double Antigen Multi-species (IgM/IgG) and ID Screen Rift Valley Fever Competition Multi-species commercial ELISA test kits (IDvet, Grabels, France), respectively. 1176 ticks were collected from the same animals and analyzed with different RT-qPCRs assays for CCHFV, Nairobi sheep disease virus (Orthonairovirus nairobiense, NSDV) virus and Dugbe virus (Orthonairovirus dugbeense, DUGV). Selected ticks were further screened by using a pan-Flavivirus melting curve PCR. The overall seroprevalence was higher for CCHFV (50%) compared to RVFV (28%). While a significant difference in seroprevalence between age groups was only found for CCHFV, there was a difference in RVFV seroprevalence between sampling sites that was not observed for CCHFV. None of the viruses tested were found inside the ticks. This study revealed the presence of anti-CCHFV and anti-RVFV antibodies in cattle from all four sampled localities suggesting that both viruses are circulating in cattle and may be an important cause of unidentified febrile illness in humans in the region.","Arboviruses pose a great threat to public health in sub-Saharan African countries.

Women living with HIV (WLHIV) are particularly vulnerable due to gender power imbalances, HIV-related stigma, and the bidirectional relationship between violence and HIV acquisition. In Lesotho, where HIV prevalence is among the highest globally, limited evidence exists on IPV against WLHIV. This study aims to estimate the prevalence and factors associated with IPV against women living with HIV in Lesotho. Data were drawn from the 2023/24 Lesotho DHS. A weighted sample of 467 women aged 15-49 years who were living with HIV was included. IPV was defined as having experienced at least one form of emotional, physical, or sexual violence by a partner/husband. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify factors associated with IPV. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Based on the findings of the study, 34.19% (95% CI: 30.01-38.63) of WLHIV experienced at least one form of IPV in the last 12-month preceding the survey. Moreover, the 12-month prevalence for physical, emotional, and sexual violence respectively was 25.48%, 19.61%, and 10.07%. In the final model analysis, having multiple sexual partners and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) other than HIV in the past 12-month, not having own asset, disclosing HIV status, living with a jealous partner/husband and a male-headed household, and region of residence were significantly associated with experiencing IPV. More than one-third of reproductive-age WLHIV in Lesotho experience IPV in the last 12-month preceding the survey, with key associated factors. Integrated interventions that combine HIV care with IPV screening, education, economic empowerment, and behavioral change communication are essential to mitigate IPV among WLHIV in Lesotho by considering these factors.","Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a widespread violation of women's rights and a critical public health issue, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Women living with HIV (WLHIV) are particularly vulnerable due to gender power imbalances, HIV-related stigma, and the bidirectional relationship between violence and HIV acquisition. In Lesotho, where HIV prevalence is among the highest globally, limited evidence exists on IPV against WLHIV. This study aims to estimate the prevalence and factors associated with IPV against women living with HIV in Lesotho. Data were drawn from the 2023/24 Lesotho DHS. A weighted sample of 467 women aged 15-49 years who were living with HIV was included. IPV was defined as having experienced at least one form of emotional, physical, or sexual violence by a partner/husband. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify factors associated with IPV. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Based on the findings of the study, 34.19% (95% CI: 30.01-38.63) of WLHIV experienced at least one form of IPV in the last 12-month preceding the survey.

As an emerging strategy for inhibiting bacterial infections, plasma-activated water (PAW) has proved highly effective, environment-friendly, and non-drug resistant to many bacteria. However, the plasma device is too big and requires specialists to operate, which inevitably limits its real-life application. It has been confirmed that the bactericidal effect of traditional PAW would be significantly reduced in the organic-rich environments. To better resolve the limitations, a novel super-portable plasma device was applied, and the low concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added to enhance the bactericidal effect of PAW in the organ-rich environments. A super-portable plasma device, weighing only 1 kg, was applied to generate PAW. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) were selected as the test bacteria. Colony-forming units (CFU) counting and bactericidal rate were employed to evaluate the bactericidal effect of PAW. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) was used to identify the major reactive species in PAW. Different concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added to PAW (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/PAW), and the pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), conductivity, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NO content of HP/PAW were measured to explore the bactericidal mechanisms. CCK-8 assay was used to assess the cytotoxicity of 0.1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/PAW on human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (hPDLFs). The 20 mL of PAW generated by the novel super-portable plasma device achieved the bactericidal rate of 98.94% against S. aureus (t = 10 min) and 99.66% (t = 20 min). When the PAW was prepared with a volume of 20 mL, activation times of 6 min and 8 min, and the treatment time was 30 min, the bactericidal rates all exceeded 98% against P. gingivalis. The addition of 0.1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> significantly enhanced the antibacterial effect of PAW in the presence of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (p<0.05). The addition of 0.1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> lowered the pH, increased the ORP and conductivity, and raised the content of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NO in the solution. Cytotoxicity evaluation indicated that 0.1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/PAW had moderate cytotoxicity only after 20 min of preparation and 48 h of treatment, while other preparation and treatment times showed mild or no cytotoxicity. The PAW generated by the novel super-portable plasma device exhibited an excellent bactericidal effect. The addition of low concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to PAW, specifically 0.1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/PAW, maintained an effective antibacterial effect in complex environments in the presence of BSA with non-cytotoxicity.","A continuous risk from bacterial infection poses a major environmental and public health challenge.

10.1186/s12879-025-11175-z,Anthropogenic influences on Rhodnius ecuadoriensis populations and nesting behaviors in sylvatic areas of southern ecuador.,"Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, remains a major public health concern. While Rhodnius ecuadoriensis, a key vector, is traditionally sylvatic, environmental disturbances have driven its adaptation to human-influenced habitats. This study explores a novel factor: how anthropogenic waste affects vector ecology by altering nest compositions. Unlike prior research, this study examines whether human-derived materials in nests influence triatomine colonization. Given rising pollution, particularly post-COVID-19, understanding its role in disease transmission is essential for developing innovative vector control strategies. Nest records were collected and analyzed in 2018, 2022, and 2023, across eight communities in Loja province, Ecuador. Nests were categorized as peridomestic if found < 30 m from a house and sylvatic if > 30 m away. The number of insects found in these nests was quantified using entomological indices. Pearson correlation analysis was applied to assess relationships between nest location and the presence of anthropogenic materials. A total of 389 nests were examined, yielding 1,089 individuals of Rhodnius ecuadoriensis (including both nymphs and adults). The infestation index in peridomestic areas dramatically decreased from 33.3% in 2018 to 0% in 2022, highlighting an intriguing temporal shift that warrants further investigation. In contrast, sylvatic areas showed fluctuating infestation rates (27.5% in 2018, 16.5% in 2022, and 22.2% in 2023). The study uniquely identified a significant association between triatomine infestation and mammal nests, with 50.1% of infested nests located within mammal habitats. Notably, 35.2% of these nests contained anthropogenic materials, particularly near human-altered landscapes such as roads and paths. The weak to moderate negative correlation between the presence of anthropogenic materials and proximity to roads or rivers (r = -0.361, p = 0.039) highlights an innovative exploration of the influence of human environmental changes on vector ecology. This study offers a novel perspective on the dual impact of increasing pollution levels on wildlife. It highlights how anthropogenic waste not only reduces vector populations but also increases mortality rates through entanglement in waste materials. These findings underscore the urgent need for environmental education programs focused on waste management within local communities. Furthermore, the study paves the way for further research to assess the rate of T. cruzi infection in relation to environmental and anthropogenic factors, offering a critical foundation for understanding and potentially mitigating Chagas disease transmission.","Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, remains a major public health concern.

Ethiopia is among the 30 countries with the highest burden of TB and TB/HIV co-infection. The emergence and spread of drug-resistant TB present significant challenges to TB care and control efforts, particularly multi-drug-resistant TB, which poses a serious public health issue in low-income countries such as Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of drug-resistant TB and its associated factors among TB patients in Dilla University Referral Hospital (DURH). A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from March-2024 to May-2024 among 216 pulmonary TB patients attending DURH. Gene Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra and Xpert MTB/XDR assay was used to assess the pattern of drug resistance in TB. The Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay was used to detect rifampicin resistance, while the Xpert MTB/XDR assay was employed to identify isoniazid resistance and resistance to second-line anti-TB drugs when rifampicin resistance was detected. Data were analyzed by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25. In this study, out of 216 confirmed MTB cases, 5 (2.3%) were identified as drug-resistant TB (DR-TB), with mono-resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid at 1.4% and 0.9%, respectively. The statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in DR-TB prevalence between those with and without a history of anti-TB treatment (p = 0.001). Notably, isoniazid mono-resistant TB was more prevalent among individuals with diabetes mellitus and those with a history of previous treatment, showing p-values of 0.018 and 0.015, respectively. Among the 216 confirmed TB cases, 5 cases of DR-TB were identified, accounting for 2.3%. DR-TB was more prevalent in patients with a history of anti-TB treatment, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced early detection and improved treatment monitoring. Additionally, isoniazid mono-resistant TB was notably prevalent in individuals with diabetes mellitus and prior treatment history, with p-values of 0.018 and 0.015, respectively.

This was accomplished by combining the catalytic domain of the SAL-1 endolysin with the peptidoglycan binding domain of lysostaphin. Expression and purification outcomes indicated that ZAM-CS exhibited significant solubility, with a yield of approximately 23 mg/L. ZAM-CS demonstrated high stability under various temperature conditions and retained most of its activity in both acidic and alkaline pH. The results of turbidity reduction assay showed a 50% decrease in the initial OD600 within 10 min at a minimum concentration of 2 µg/mL. The minimum inhibitory concentration and the minimum bactericidal concentration values of ZAM-CS are identical in the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain, indicating the strong bactericidal properties of this endolysin. Antimicrobial tests showed ZAM-CS was also effective against coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Enterococcus faecalis.

Fine mapping and functional validation identified them as candidate genes. Photoperiod-sensitive flowering in Gossypium hirsutum is closely linked to the node position of the first fruiting branch (NFFB). Utilizing an F₂ population generated from a cross between the late-flowering semi-wild cotton Palmeri 37 and the modern cultivar CCRI74, we mapped two genes related to NFFB with additive effects on chromosome D03 (1.13 cM) and D08 (2.72 cM). Through fine mapping and sequence analysis, we identified AGAMOUS-LIKE8(GhAGL8) and JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN1(GhJAZ1) as candidate genes. Subcellular localization assays indicated that both proteins are predominantly localized in the nucleus. GhAGL8 exhibited consistently higher expression levels in CCRI 74 compared to Palmeri 37, across various leaf stages. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of GhAGL8 delayed NFFB and increased plant height. A haplotype variation in the promoter region of GhAGL8 (TT/- at -1036 bp) was strongly correlated with variations in NFFB and gene expression. GhJAZ1 was more highly expressed in CCRI74 than in Palmeri 37, particularly in leaves, stems, and calyces, with expression progressively increasing during seedling development. A CCRI74-specific amino acid insertion in GhJAZ1 may enhance flower bud differentiation, promoting early flowering.

Within the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), it is paramount to understand and evaluate the information being provided by AI platforms concerning the safety, side effects, and efficacy of medications to prevent and treat HIV. Prompts (n = 38) requesting information regarding HIV medication use for prevention and treatment were inputted into three AI-based Large Language Models (LLMs; ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4.0, Google Bard [now Gemini]) and one chatbot (HIV.gov Chatbot) on four consecutive weeks. Outputs (n = 608) were recorded verbatim, weekly by platform. Qualitative analyses using a conventional content analysis coding approach examined key themes in responses; response comprehensiveness was rated via the number of themes represented in a response. Core themes emerged across prompts. A recommendation to speak with a medical professional for further information was the most common theme across platforms. Organ/bone side effects were the most prevalent side effect. Responses pointed to medication efficacy to prevent and treat HIV. ChatGPT 4.0 provided the most comprehensive responses across platforms, while the HIV.gov Chatbot gave the least comprehensive information. Health information on HIV medication safety, side effects, and efficacy is widely available using AI platforms. Results indicate that AI responses typically included recommendations to consult a medical professional to personalize care. The efficacy of medications was never questioned across AI platforms. Future research directions for AI use within the context of HIV prevention and care are provided.","Health information is highly accessible with the prominence of artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, such as Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT).

Here we introduce PandemicLLM, a framework with multi-modal large language models (LLMs) that reformulates real-time forecasting of disease spread as a text-reasoning problem, with the ability to incorporate real-time, complex, non-numerical information. This approach, through an artificial intelligence-human cooperative prompt design and time-series representation learning, encodes multi-modal data for LLMs. The model is applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, and trained to utilize textual public health policies, genomic surveillance, spatial and epidemiological time-series data, and is tested across all 50 states of the United States for a duration of 19 months. PandemicLLM opens avenues for incorporating various pandemic-related data in heterogeneous formats and shows performance benefits over existing models.","Forecasting the short-term spread of an ongoing disease outbreak poses a challenge owing to the complexity of contributing factors, some of which can be characterized through interlinked, multi-modality variables, and the intersection of public policy and human behavior.

In this study, we identified a novel mycovirus from the B. dothidea strain ZM200473, which we have tentatively designated ""Botryosphaeria dothidea non-segmented dsRNA virus"" (BdNSRV1). The genome of BdNSRV1 is composed of dsRNA that spans 2,902 base pairs and contains two non-overlapping open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2). ORF1 encodes a hypothetical protein consisting of 316 amino acids with a molecular weight of 35.0 kDa, and this protein shares similarity to the coat proteins of several mycoviruses. ORF2 encodes a protein of 561 amino acids with a molecular weight of 66.0 kDa, which includes a conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis indicated that BdNSRV1 establishes a well-supported independent clade alongside members of the recently established genus Unirnavirus, being most closely related to Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae mycovirus 1 (LpMyV1), with 70.74% amino acid sequence identity in the RdRp. Therefore, BdNSRV1 should be classified as a novel non-segmented dsRNA mycovirus of the genus Unirnavirus and is the first characterized non-segmented virus associated with B. dothidea.","Botryosphaeria dothidea is a prevalent pathogen of woody plants with a global distribution.

In this pilot longitudinal study, we investigate the potential of vaginal microbiome biomarkers to predict CIN3 development in hrHPV-positive (hrHPV+) women of reproductive age and assess loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) outcomes.Fifty-nine non-menopausal women 20-53 years old, with normal cytology, were selected from the ARTISTIC trial and followed up twice over six years. Vaginal microbiome was analysed by 16S rRNA sequencing. HrHPV+ women with CIN3 showed a significant overrepresentation of Sneathia amnii, Megasphaera genomosp., Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Achromobacter spanius (p < 0.05).

Assessment of the sustained virologic response (SVR) after treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAA) is based exclusively on HCV-RNA testing in plasma/serum, which may preclude the diagnosis of post-treatment OCI. Possible clinical consequences of OCI were described previously, but its occurrence after DAA-based antiviral treatment programs and determinants of the virus persistence are not fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of post-treatment OCI after successful DAA-based treatment and to identify clinical and immunological factors associated with this phenomenon. In 97 patients treated with DAA, HCV-RNA was tested by RT-PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at baseline (i.e., before the onset of treatment) and at the time of SVR assessment. Before treatment, HCV-RNA was detectable in all patients' PBMC. All subjects responded to therapy according to the clinical criteria, but 9 (9.3%) patients revealed the HCV-RNA in PBMC at SVR. In most of these cases, post-DAA OCI was related to switch of the dominant infecting genotype. Post-treatment OCI was characterized by significantly lower pre-treatment HCV viral load and lower expression of Tim-3 (T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3) on CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Our results imply that post-treatment OCI may be related to lower pretreatment viral load as well as distinct pre-existing immune exhaustion status.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a primary hepatotropic pathogen responsible for acute and chronic hepatitis C, however, it can also cause ""occult"" infection (OCI), defined as the presence of the virus' genetic material in hepatocytes and/or peripheral blood cells, but not in plasma/serum.

Aphid vectors and the use of latently infected planting materials disseminate the disease. This paper uses a deterministic mathematical model to examine the BBTD dynamics while considering the Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV)-resistance of the planting material. After model formulation, we establish the positivity and boundedness of the model solution. We derived the effective reproduction number via the next-generation matrix approach and used it to investigate the asymptotic stability of the model equilibrium points using the Lyapunov function. To support the stability results, we conducted a bifurcation analysis. The bifurcation analysis confirmed a forward bifurcation, implying that the disease-free equilibrium point is stable when the effective reproduction number is less than one and unstable when the effective reproduction number is greater than one. The endemic equilibrium point is also stable when the effective reproduction number is greater than one and unstable otherwise. Finally, we apply the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to simulate the proposed model. One limitation of our research is the need for real data to support our findings. in this instance, we used simulated data from earlier studies to conduct numerical simulations in this study. The results revealed that replanting with BBTV-resistance planting material while the rate of removing symptomatic infected plants is [Formula: see text] reduces the number of latent and symptomatic infected banana plants by [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively, in two years. Moreover, it was observed that increasing the rate of roguing to [Formula: see text] and replanting with BBTV-resistant planting material remaining at [Formula: see text] cleared the diseased plants in 10 months. Hence, it eliminates the disease. Therefore, the numerical simulation results suggest that while virus-resistant planting materials alone can reduce disease prevalence, they are most effective when combined with a timely roguing strategy. The results indicate that increasing the number of resistant plants beyond a certain threshold can lead to disease elimination. It is recommended that scientists provide farmers with reliable BBTV-resistant planting material and farming education on the safe way to rogue infected plants and replant.","Banana bunchy top disease (BBTD) significantly threatens banana production, considerably endangering food safety and security.

Our study aims to evaluate changes in the dynamic activity patterns of functional brain communities in the early stages of HIV infection by comparing time-varying multilayer network metrics. A total of 165 persons living with HIV but without neurocognitive disorders (PWND), 173 individuals with asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), and 100 matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. A time-varying multilayer network model was constructed, and global modularity (Q value) and nodal flexibility were calculated using different parameter settings (γ = [0.9, 1, 1.1], ω = [0.5, 0.75, 1]). Brain functional alterations in the PWND and ANI groups were evaluated from both global and nodal perspectives. Associations between network measures, clinical variables, and cognitive performance were also explored. Using the full connectivity matrix, no significant differences in global modularity (Q value) were found among the three groups. However, when thresholding the matrix to retain the top 10% of strongest connections, the ANI group showed significantly lower modularity than the HC group across all γ and ω combinations (p < 0.05). At γ = 0.9 and ω = 0.5, reduced nodal flexibility was observed in visual network regions in the PWND group, while the ANI group showed reduced flexibility in regions belonging to the default mode network (DMN), sensorimotor network (SMN), and limbic network (LIM). At γ = 0.9 and ω = 1, the ANI group exhibited increased flexibility in DMN regions compared to HC. Additionally, thresholding the top 10% connections revealed increased flexibility in the right lingual gyrus (visual network) in ANI compared to HC (FDR corrected, p < 0.05). Nodal flexibility was positively correlated with neurocognitive performance in the PWND group, whereas a significant negative correlation was observed in the ANI group. Regardless of cognitive impairment, HIV patients exhibit abnormalities in dynamic community structures. These findings provide new insights and perspectives for the early detection of brain damage, advancing our current understanding of time-varying multilayer networks in HIV patients.","Approximately half of HIV patients continue to experience HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND).

The limited ability of most antibiotics to enter intracellular compartments underscores the urgent need for innovative antimicrobial agents capable of overcoming these barriers. In this study, the antibacterial peptide Pac525 was synthesized with the RGD domain to facilitate efficient penetration into eukaryotic cells. The efficacy and safety of RGD-Pac525 was evaluated in intracellular infection models, using the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, chicken intestinal organoids, and chicken embryo tissues via the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Our findings from cell line experiments demonstrate that the RGD-Pac525 peptide retained the antimicrobial properties of the original peptide without compromising its efficacy. While RGD-Pac525 reduced the intracellular adherent-invasive pathogen Escherichia coli KV203 by 50% in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells, it did not adversely affect the macrophage viability. Additionally, RGD-Pac525 effectively reduced the intracellular bacterial burden in organoids, without compromising their structural integrity. In ovo bioassays, a substantial reduction in the bacterial load was observed in liver and intestinal tissues, indicating the peptide ability to achieve systemic distribution and to overcome tissue barriers. RGD-Pac525 was effective in infection models by suppressing bacterial growth. Preliminary observations suggest it may also affect host responses, indicating a potential for combined antimicrobial and therapeutic effects that warrant further studies. This study provides a compelling proof of concept for utilizing RGD-modified antimicrobial peptides for treatment of intracellular bacterial infections.","Infections caused by invasive intracellular bacteria pose major therapeutic challenges due to pathogen survival and growth inside of host cells as well as the low intracellular accessibility for conventional antibiotics.

Gasdermin E (GSDME) mediates pyroptosis, a lytic and inflammatory type of cell death. Cleavage of GSDME by caspase-3 releases the active N-terminal domain, which subsequently forms transmembrane pores, leading to cell lysis and death. In this study, we investigated a role for GSDME in severe influenza. Infection of human bronchial epithelial cells revealed that IAV induces GSDME cleavage and activation, with the magnitude and kinetics of GSDME activation differing between IAV strains. Caspase-3-mediated GSDME activation preceded and overwhelmed gasdermin D (GSDMD) activation. siRNA silencing in vitro confirmed both gasdermins are active in human bronchial epithelial cells and cooperate to drive IAV responses. IAV infection of mice promoted GSDME cleavage in E-cadherin<sup>+</sup> epithelial cells in vivo at day 3. Mice deficient in GSDME (Gsdme<sup>-/-</sup>) showed improved survival and greater influenza disease resistance compared to their wildtype littermate controls. Gsdme<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited reduced neutrophil infiltration and levels of cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β in the airways and IL-6, TNF, and IFNγ in the serum. This was accompanied by reduced viral loads, lung pathology, and epithelial cell death.

Parasitic infections like malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma brucei) have driven genetic selection for resistance. For instance, the sickle-cell mutation (HBB:c.20A>T) offers malaria protection but causes sickle-cell disease. Similarly, APOL1 gene variants (G1/G2) protect against sleeping sickness but increase the risk of kidney disease. While these variants provide survival benefits, they also pose significant health challenges. This highlights the need for research into their effects on organ systems, epistasis, and potential therapies. Drugs targeting APOL1 synthesis are being tested to treat APOL1-mediated nephropathy, and exploring African genomes may uncover new parasite-resistant variants, advancing global genomic medicine.","African populations harbor the highest genetic diversity globally, shaped by over 300 000 years of adaptation to the continent's diverse ecology. Parasitic infections like malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma brucei) have driven genetic selection for resistance. For instance, the sickle-cell mutation (HBB:c.20A>T) offers malaria protection but causes sickle-cell disease. Similarly, APOL1 gene variants (G1/G2) protect against sleeping sickness but increase the risk of kidney disease.

Typically, these host-virus interactions are studied at the population level using bulk transcriptomics, which presents a population-averaged perspective and masks diverse infection states. Recent advancements in single-cell technologies enable a simultaneous view of the virus and its host within a population and expose phenotypic heterogeneity during infection. We present a promising avenue for investigating marine viral ecology from a new single-cell perspective to reveal the viral life cycle and host antiviral strategies employed by rare resistant cells. Consequently, we can detect specific host-virus dynamics in the complex natural population, track the spread of infection across ecosystems, and study the ecological impact of marine viruses at an unprecedented resolution.","Viral infections of marine microbes greatly impact ecological and biogeochemical processes.

Isavuconazole (ISA), a broad-spectrum triazole antifungal, has emerged as an effective alternative for treating IFI in adults, especially those caused by Aspergillus and Mucorales. Recent approvals by the Food and Drug Administration (2023) and the European Medicines Agency (2024) have extended the use of ISA to paediatric populations, offering an important addition to the current treatment options. Two clinical trials have assessed ISA in paediatric patients, showing it is generally well tolerated, with an acceptable safety profile. While adverse events are primarily gastrointestinal and hepatic, they are less frequent than those associated with voriconazole or liposomal amphotericin B. According to pharmacokinetic studies, drug clearance is faster in children, particularly in those under 35kg; thus, doses require careful modification. ISA may represent a crucial advancement in the treatment of paediatric IFIs, but therapeutic drug monitoring remains essential due to variability in drug concentrations.","Invasive fungal infections (IFI) present significant challenges in newborn, children and adolescents, particularly in immunocompromised patients, such as those with some primary immunodeficiencies or hematologic malignancies, and those who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Although real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, as the gold standard method, is widely used for nucleic acid quantification, its reliance on complex instrumentation and trained personnel in centralized laboratories presents significant challenges in applications such as rapid home-based self-testing or screening in remote areas. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop miniaturized, low-cost, user-friendly, and high-performance point-of-care testing (POCT) devices for nucleic acid detection to meet the demands of infectious pathogen screening in resource-limited settings. In this study, a low-cost and power-free microfluidic device (PFMD), which realized contamination-free analysis with 'sample-in-visual-result-out' capability, was developed. The proposed system integrated rapid extraction and enrichment of nucleic acid from serum samples, isothermal nucleic acid amplification, and visual readout of lateral flow test strips. The entire detection process was completed within 40 min. Power-free isothermal amplification was enabled by a disposable warm patch. The detection performance of the PFMD was evaluated using nucleic acid standards of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and other pathogens, as well as clinical serum samples from suspected hepatitis B cases. The PFMD successfully accomplished rapid magnetic bead-based nucleic acid extraction and achieved a lower limit of detection of 3.04 copies/μL. The clinical experimental results of the device were consistent with those obtained by quantitative PCR and real-time fluorescent loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods, with 100 % diagnostic sensitivity and 100 % diagnostic specificity. This work presents an integrated, portable, low-cost, and power-free POCT method for nucleic acid detection, which demonstrates rapid diagnostic capabilities for complex clinical samples and exhibits outstanding sensitivity and specificity. Clinical validation confirms that the proposed method and device are well-suited for on-site rapid screening of infectious diseases such as hepatitis B, particularly in resource-constrained settings without access to electricity or trained professionals.","Rapid on-site nucleic acid testing plays a critical role in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases.

Complex biological or environmental samples contain interfering compounds requiring advanced protocols for removing salts, small organic molecules, and/or proteins without compromising the DNA fragments distribution in the original sample. High-molecular-weight DNA fragments are often discriminated by standard extraction methods in attempts to remove the highly concentrated inorganic sample components. Here, we introduce a simple device for the simplification, purification, desalting, and buffer exchange of complex biological samples based on electrodialysis in discontinuous electrolyte systems. The device combines a 3D-printed body with two electrolyte reservoirs and commercially available cassettes with dialysis membranes as inserts. Upon applying an electric current via electrodes inside the electrolyte reservoirs, the sample ions, injected into the cassette or one of the electrolyte reservoirs, electromigrate across the dialysis membranes. During this process, small sample ions pass through the membrane and are substituted by the ions of the selected buffers loaded into the electrolyte reservoirs. The larger ions, such as DNA fragments or proteins, stay in the sample reservoir. The performance of the device was evaluated using DNA samples in blood plasma. Several milliliters of a plasma sample were purified in 30 min with 90 % DNA recovery. The device enables fast and effective purification of highly complicated samples. It can be easily scaled for the available sample amount (ranging from microliters to milliliters) and the analyte size of interest by selecting appropriate membrane pore sizes. The device's applicability was optimized on DNA samples with high salt content and tested on plasma samples. But it also has the potential for purification/desalting of a wide range of biological compounds, including proteins, peptides, or charged oligosaccharides, as well as organelles, cells, viruses, or bacteria.","The quality and yield of DNA specimens are essential for downstream analyses.

The objective of this study was to determine whether short-term high compared to low fat (LF) intake affects serum endotoxin and gut microbiota in a controlled trial of older individuals with obesity or normal weight. In this randomized crossover study, adults (50-79 years old) with obesity or normal weight were assigned to 5 days of HF (40%) or LF (20%) diet followed by a washout period and then the other diet. A 5-hour mixed meal tolerance test (46% fat) was performed after the LF diet. Serum was analyzed for endotoxin, zonulin, and inflammatory biomarkers. Fecal bacterial community was analyzed by rRNA operon profiling. Participants were 64 years (95% CI: 62, 66) and 66% were female. Body mass index (BMI) was 24.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CI: 23.5, 25.0) and 36.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CI: 33.4, 39.8) in the group with normal body weight (n=16) and obesity (n=16), respectively. The rise in postprandial endotoxin was 1.8-fold higher in individuals with obesity compared to normal weight (p=0.010). After the study diets, fasting serum endotoxin was higher after the HF than LF diet in the group with obesity [mean difference: 0.13 EU/mL (95% CI: 0.02, 0.24), p=0.022], but not the normal weight group [mean difference: 0.03 EU/mL (95% CI: -0.07, 0.14), p=0.613].

However, despite previous descriptive research there is a need for rigorously controlled field studies to clarify the interactions between Ae. aegypti density and human infections. We report on a multi-arm cluster randomized field trial aimed at determining the number of female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes below which dengue outbreaks are limited. We implemented four mosquito control treatments in a dose-response trial, using zero to three Autocidal Gravid Ovitraps (AGO traps) per house across study neighborhoods in Caguas, Puerto Rico from January 2021 to June 2024. We anticipated that significant reductions in Ae. aegypti populations would indicate a threshold density if low or no prevalence of dengue viruses was observed in mosquitoes or antibodies in residents through IgM and IgG serological testing. Results showed that female Ae. aegypti densities decreased by 44 %, 60 %, and 80 % in clusters with one, two, and three traps/house, respectively. The expected number of dengue-infected mosquitoes per thousand were 2.01, 1.70, 0.60, and 0.36 in clusters with zero, one, two, and three traps/house, respectively.

Overlapping BTLA binding sites in herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) for different ligand/receptor interactions including CD160 and herpes simplex virus (HSV) glycoprotein D (gD) (HSV gD) trigger competitions and provide opportunities to block one direction instead allowing the activity of another, such as LIGHT (CD258) for tumor targeted purposes. BTLA seemingly masks the therapeutic potential of anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1), so it can be a target in cancer immunotherapy. It seems that BTLA predominantly take inhibitory pro-tumor path. PD-1 mainly recruits SHP-2, while BTLA mainly recruits SHP-1 to promote immunosuppression. Targeting BTLA-HVEM ligation using BTLA inhibitors or application of peptides occupying the BTLA site in HVEM are strategies for targeting BTLA in cancer immunotherapy. However, there is also another side of the coin so that activation of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) which only exists in the cytoplasmic tail of BTLA promotes stimulatory route to this checkpoint, and recalling the stimulatory path with appropriate inducers may positively affect responses to adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) against cancer.","B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) is a co-inhibitory receptor of B7 family that shares structural homology with cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1). Overlapping BTLA binding sites in herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) for different ligand/receptor interactions including CD160 and herpes simplex virus (HSV) glycoprotein D (gD) (HSV gD) trigger competitions and provide opportunities to block one direction instead allowing the activity of another, such as LIGHT (CD258) for tumor targeted purposes. BTLA seemingly masks the therapeutic potential of anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1), so it can be a target in cancer immunotherapy. It seems that BTLA predominantly take inhibitory pro-tumor path. PD-1 mainly recruits SHP-2, while BTLA mainly recruits SHP-1 to promote immunosuppression.

This study employed in vitro simulated human digestion and fecal fermentation models to evaluate the effects of M. esculenta polysaccharide on gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production. Additionally, a relationship between M. esculenta polysaccharide composition, gut microbiota, and functional role was constructed to elucidate their interactions. The results revealed that 44.87 % of M. esculenta polysaccharide was digested, leading to a reduction in molecular weight and alterations in monosaccharide composition, including decreased glucose and increased galactose and mannose. Fermentation of M. esculenta polysaccharide significantly enhanced SCFAs production and promoted the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, such as Bacteroides, Collinsella, and Bifidobacterium, while notably reducing Ruminococcus torques. Carbohydrate metabolism was enriched in Collinsella and Bifidobacterium which positively correlated with SCFAs biosynthesis e.g., propanoate and butanoate biosynthesis. These findings provide valuable insights into M. esculenta polysaccharide as prebiotic potential, highlighting its functional role in modulating gut microbiota and promoting gut health.","Morchella esculenta, a nutritious and medicinal edible mushroom, has gained an increasing attention due to the bioactive properties of its polysaccharides.

This study evaluates the outcomes of first VP shunt placements at the area's largest tertiary hospital. A retrospective study conducted at Shifa Medical Complex in the Gaza Strip examined VP shunts inserted between January 2020 and July 2022. The primary outcome was the shunt failure rates in the first year, while secondary outcomes included the causes of failure and surgical complications. The Chi-square test was used to assess the relationship between risk factors and failure rates. Univariate logistic regression analyzed the link between the duration of post-operative antibiotics and shunt failure rates. A total of 103 patients were included, with a median age of 11 months. Congenital hydrocephalus accounted for 60.2% of the etiologies. Failure rates were 7.8%, 19.4%, and 26.2% at one, six, and twelve months, respectively. Obstruction and infection were the commonest causes of initial (62.9% and 25.9%) and overall (46.2% and 36.5%) shunt failures. Failure risk increased with elective surgeries, surgeries performed by residents, congenital hydrocephalus, and in the 12-month or younger age group (p < 0.001, p = 0.035, p = 0.02, p < 0.001). Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the most commonly isolated bacteria. No significant association was found between the duration of postoperative IV antibiotics and the one-year shunt failure rate. The outcomes of VP shunt surgery at Gaza's largest tertiary center from 2020 to 2022 aligned with global trends. Prolonged IV antibiotics did not lower revision or complication rates.","The Gaza Strip is a low-income, chronically unstable region.

Nevertheless, the development of new therapeutics remains important to expand treatment options and address existing limitations. Previously, we reported that isopentyl caffeate (ICaf) exhibited potent activity against promastigotes and amastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis without notable toxicity in a murine model. This study investigated the effects of ICaf on the metallopeptidase gp63 (leishmanolysin), a key virulence factor in Leishmania that supports parasite survival by modulating host immune responses, degrading host proteins, and facilitating macrophage invasion. Molecular docking analysis revealed that ICaf interacted with key amino acids within the active site of gp63, achieving a docking score of -5.5 kcal/mol. The gp63-ICaf interaction was stabilized through a combination of hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, metal-acceptor interactions and van der Waals forces. Experimental data supported these in silico findings, with ICaf showing a typical dose-dependent inhibition of gp63 proteolytic activity, resulting in an IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.51 µM and a K<sub>i</sub> of 9.89 µM. The formation of a stable gp63-ICaf complex was demonstrated by gel electrophoresis assay. Furthermore, pretreatment of promastigotes with ICaf reduced cell-associated gp63 proteolytic activity, as evidenced by decreased hydrolysis of the fluorogenic peptide substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC and gelatin incorporated into electrophoresis gel. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, both using anti-gp63 antibodies, further confirmed a decrease in gp63 expression on the parasite surface. In summary, these findings suggest that ICaf is a promising strategy against leishmaniasis, offering a potential new approach to disease treatment.","Leishmaniasis is managed with a variety of compounds, whose toxicity, cost, and efficacy vary depending on the disease form.

Recent research underscores the involvement of ferroptosis in periodontitis progression. However, due to the multifactorial mechanism underlying ferroptosis, the traditional drug intervention strategy focusing on a single target have been unable to solve all the harmful factors and achieve complete clinical cure. Herein, a multifunctional MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers was developed by decorating L-cysteine and galangin (MLG), while incorporate in a thermosensitive ionic liquid hydrogel (ACIS@MLG), which offer multitarget tailored regulation of ferroptosis. The characteristics of ACIS@MLG was evaluated, and their therapeutic effects on pathogens and LPS-induced periodontitis rat model were verified. ACIS@MLG performed excellent antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and protective effects on periodontal tissue. Mechanistically, transcriptomics analyses suggested that MLG exerted therapeutic effects by regulating ferroptosis in periodontal ligament stem cells. MLG restored ferroptosis-induced mitochondrial membrane potential abnormalities through ROS scavenging and reducing iron overload. In addition, MLG inhibited ferroptosis by remodeling lipid peroxidation via AMPK/Nrf2/SLC7A11 pathway.

Throughout this period, a total of 947 PCR herpesvirus tests in mucocutaneous swabs were performed, 448 of which tested positive (266 for HSV). Regarding the PCR-confirmed mucocutaneous HSV infections, HSV-1 was the main cause of orolabial herpes and HSV-2 of genital herpes. A significant proportion of patients were immunocompromised, demonstrating the risk for herpesvirus infection and reactivation in this setting. HSV-1 genital herpes was more common in women, younger individuals and had a lower rate of recurrences. This study demonstrates the variable clinical spectrum of HSV infections, and the importance of their laboratory confirmation, as the recognition of the specific pathogen may determine optimal management and prognosis.","Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are widespread among humans.

RSV-related ARIs significantly affect the relevant clinical outcomes, including hospitalization and mortality, in older adults. Elderly individuals and those with chronic diseases are at a higher risk of infections with severe morbidity because of clinical frailty and deficiencies in immune responses. Prevention of respiratory viral infections in the adult population can be achieved through hygiene measures and active immunization. Several vaccination strategies have been developed, including nucleic acid, subunit, chimeric, live-attenuated, particle-based, and recombinant vaccines, with varying results. Subunit vaccines involving the RSV-fusion protein F in its prefusional (pre-F) conformation, with or without adjuvants, have demonstrated significant protection in older adults, reducing the rate of total and severe RSV-related lower tract respiratory diseases (LRTDs). Similarly, an mRNA vaccine encoding for the stabilized pre-F conformation showed a significantly reduced RSV-associated LRTDs in older adults. This evidence led to recent approval of two subunit vaccines (Arexvy and Abrysvo) and one nucleic acid-based vaccine (mResvia) by regulatory authorities. Currently, several vaccines are recommended for adults, resulting in crowded schedules. Therefore, covaccination is a potential strategy for improving vaccine adherence. The coadministration of approved RSV vaccines with seasonal influenza vaccines has been proven to be non-inferior to the immune response from sequential administration.

10.1016/j.str.2025.05.008,Antimalarial drug artemisinin stabilizes PfRACK1 binding to the ribosome.,"Artemisinin and its derivatives represent the core agents in artemisinin combination therapies that are the current frontline treatment for P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria infections. Artemisinins are known to bind a wide array of proteins that disrupt the parasite's cellular physiology. Here, we show that artemisinins' cytotoxic activity involves structural alteration of key P. falciparum macromolecular complexes, including the ribosome, proteasome, and T-complex. The structural analysis revealed that, following artemisinin treatment, a larger population of Pf80S ribosomes binds PfRACK1. Unlike in most eukaryotes, PfRACK1 does not interact with the C-terminal tail of the r-protein uS3 that in Plasmodium is truncated. This likely suggests an evolved role of uS3 in facilitating RACK1-mediated translational regulation, which would potentially benefit the parasite under certain conditions. Stabilization of RACK1 ribosome interaction likely contributes to artemisinins' mode of action.","Artemisinin and its derivatives represent the core agents in artemisinin combination therapies that are the current frontline treatment for P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria infections.

Physicochemical treatment systems are associated with high operational and capital costs. Also, prevalent biologically operated treatment systems majorly rely on heterotrophic bacteria for eliminating both nutrients as well as emerging contaminants. However, owing to the non-specific treatment regimes of the WWTPs, the discharge of PPCPs into the aquatic ecosystems and the resultant biomagnification is inevitable. The inclusion of algae into the treatment systems has broadened the facets of treatment owing to the complex cellular structure and function of the former. The presence of bacterial communities in the phycosphere of algae and their coherent action in the uptake of contaminants form the basis of their consideration for wastewater treatment. This article discusses the fate and global scenario of PPCPs in the water ecosystem based on recent literature, along with providing a glance into the mechanisms of PPCP uptake by algae. The exploration of mutualism or symbiosis between the algal and bacterial communities is one of the primary objectives of this review. The mechanisms of metabolism and the trade-off of nutrient substrates have also been vividly discussed. The usage of algal bacterial consortia (ABC) for nutrient and PPCP removal, along with methods to enhance the removal by phycoremediation, has also been delineated. Commercial and pilot-scale applications of ABC-based systems have been discussed.

However, there have been no reports demonstrating an increased susceptibility of birds to pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella following the removal of AGPs from the animal feed. For the present studies, we hypothesize that a dietary-derived, low-grade chronic intestinal inflammation increases the susceptibility of young broiler chickens to intestinal colonization, extraintestinal infection, and the pathogenicity of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE). Two separate experiments were conducted separating a total of 250 birds/experiment into 2 feeding regimes: a normal basal corn-soy diet and a corn-soy + 30 % rice bran starting on the day of hatch through 28 days. Each diet contained 25 non-challenged control birds with the remaining 100 birds/diet divided into groups of 25 that were orally challenged with SE at either 1-, 7-, 14-, or 21-days post-hatch. At 28 days post-hatch, all birds were euthanized to evaluate SE intestinal colonization and organ invasion, and all birds and left-over feed were weighed to evaluate weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion. The high NSP diet had a detrimental effect on the animals' performance as evidenced by significant reduction in weight gain and feed intake and increased feed conversion. Birds fed the high NSP diet for at least 7 days were found to have significantly more detectable SE in both the ceca and in the liver compared to the control corn-soy fed birds. Lastly, there was a significant increase in SE recovery in birds fed the high NSP diet for at least 7 days. These results provide evidence that the diet-induced chronic gut inflammation created a more advantageous colonization environment for Salmonella. The consequence of low-grade chronic intestinal inflammation remains a major issue within the poultry industry as it is felt economically since it affects FCR and renders birds more susceptible to enteric pathogen colonization and invasion.","Removal of growth-promoting antibiotics (AGPs) is associated with the emergence of chronic, low-level gut inflammation induced by environmental stressors, especially diet components.

10.1016/j.prevetmed.2025.106590,Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus transmission among smallholder pig farms in western Uganda.,"Pig production is a rapidly growing sector in Uganda, especially among smallholder farmers to whom it provides a vital source of income. However, the burden of productivity-limiting diseases such as Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) poses a significant challenge. This is exacerbated by the paucity of information on the occurrence of these pathogens within the country, highlighting the need to study their transmission dynamics for effective control. Here, we modelled the transmission of PRRS in western Uganda and evaluated its control under strategies targeting closure of biosecurity gaps related to practices such as equipment sharing, free ranging, boar sharing, farm visits, and restocking. We used data from 398 pig-farming households to assess husbandry practices, and to estimate contact rates and distances for simulating the spread of PRRS among the 44,125 farms in the study area. Biosecurity measures were found to be low among pig farms in the region, with only 0.8 % of them keeping their entire herd confined all-year round, limiting access to unauthorized persons, and using disinfectants. Under the current state of biosecurity, a PRRS outbreak would result in 17. 57 % of the pig farms in the region being infected within two years, with the medium and large-scale smallholder farms being most affected. The outbreak would persist beyond 2 years (with a 67.80 % likelihood), stabilizing around 700 days post-introduction; reaching a prevalence of 5.15 %; and with a median of 17 farms being infected daily during this endemic phase. However, eliminating visitor traffic could entirely halt PRRS spread, while eliminating risks associated with boar sharing, restocking, and scavenging would lead to reductions of 99.85 %, 99.44 %, and 40.67 %, respectively. Furthermore, even a moderate adoption of improved biosecurity measures related to farm visits or boar sharing, could significantly reduce the effects of PRRS in the region. For instance, reducing the frequency of farm visits or boar sharing by 25 % across all pig farms could reduce PRRS transmission by 99.61 % or 73.95 % respectively. This outcome could also be achieved through a targeted adoption rate of 50 % within large-scale smallholder farms coupled with a 25 % rate for medium-scaled ones. Our results highlight the necessity of promoting enhanced on-farm biosecurity practices in smallholder pig farms, given the challenges posed by productivity-limiting diseases such as PRRS, in Uganda's rapidly growing piggery industry.","Pig production is a rapidly growing sector in Uganda, especially among smallholder farmers to whom it provides a vital source of income.

Although the general ecotoxicity of herbicides has been verified, their effects on non-target soil functional bacteria, e.g., nitrogen-fixing bacteria, remained unknown. Herein, we investigated the potential impacts of florasulam on the nitrogen-fixing model bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii and sought to understand the underlying mechanisms. The growth activity of A. vinelandii was inhibited by florasulam in a concentration-dependent pattern, and the half-lethal concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) was calculated as 8.21 mg/L. Surprisingly, the nitrogen-fixing activity and energy metabolism of A. vinelandii were stimulated by florasulam at 4-8 mg/L. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the gene expression of nitrogen-fixing bacteria changed significantly after florasulam treatment. The genes encoding the iron nitrogenase and the key enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) were significantly up-regulated. Metabolomic analyses elucidated that florasulam inhibited the folate metabolism pathways on the third and seventh days, directly impairing the DNA replication processes and consequently hindering the cell division, which led to the reduction of biotin and riboflavin levels. Notably, the up-regulation of amino acid biosynthesis, the TCA cycle, and glutathione metabolism networks likely maintained the high nitrogen fixation capacity of A. vinelandii.

10.1016/j.virol.2025.110594,Co-acquisition of two sugar beet poleroviruses by M. persicae increased the transmission efficiency of both viruses.,"Beet mild yellowing virus (BMYV) and beet chlorosis virus (BChV) are two closely related poleroviruses infecting sugar beet plants, which induce leaf yellowing and cause high yield losses. Poleroviruses are phloem-limited and strictly transmitted by aphids in a circulative and persistent manner. In nature, sugar beet plants can be coinfected by these two viruses, but the outcome of BMYV and BChV coexistence in a plant on virus accumulation and aphid transmission has never been addressed before. In this study, we showed that the accumulation of each virus was not affected by the presence of the other, despite coinfecting about 40 % of infected phloem cells. Both viruses crossed the gut epithelium at the same site in Myzus persicae without any evidence of competition for receptor binding. On the contrary, when aphids simultaneously acquired both viruses from an artificial medium containing equal amounts of each virus, the transmission efficiency increased for both viruses. In contrast, only BMYV exhibited enhanced transmission when acquired from a coinfected plant. This suggests a cooperative effect at the inoculation step facilitating virus delivery in sugar beet cells by aphids. Our results shed light on fine-tuned virus-virus and virus-vector interactions, with potential implications for epidemiology and disease management.","Beet mild yellowing virus (BMYV) and beet chlorosis virus (BChV) are two closely related poleroviruses infecting sugar beet plants, which induce leaf yellowing and cause high yield losses. Poleroviruses are phloem-limited and strictly transmitted by aphids in a circulative and persistent manner. In nature, sugar beet plants can be coinfected by these two viruses, but the outcome of BMYV and BChV coexistence in a plant on virus accumulation and aphid transmission has never been addressed before. In this study, we showed that the accumulation of each virus was not affected by the presence of the other, despite coinfecting about 40 % of infected phloem cells. Both viruses crossed the gut epithelium at the same site in Myzus persicae without any evidence of competition for receptor binding. On the contrary, when aphids simultaneously acquired both viruses from an artificial medium containing equal amounts of each virus, the transmission efficiency increased for both viruses. In contrast, only BMYV exhibited enhanced transmission when acquired from a coinfected plant. This suggests a cooperative effect at the inoculation step facilitating virus delivery in sugar beet cells by aphids.

PREVENT-19 (NCT04611802/2019nCoV-301), a pivotal phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated robust efficacy of a primary, 2-dose series of NVX-CoV2373 against COVID-19. Protocol expansions to PREVENT-19 included enrollment of adolescents (aged 12 to <18 years) and administration of 3rd and 4th doses of NVX-CoV2373 to adults and adolescents. Participants randomized 2:1 received NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 21 days apart; 3rd and 4th doses were administered ≥6 months after the preceding dose. Secondary and additional assessments included post-3rd- and 4th-dose immune responses (neutralizing antibody [nAb], anti-rS IgG, human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-receptor binding inhibition [hACE2-RBI]) and response durability (post-3rd dose) to ancestral virus; cross-reactivity to Omicron subvariants; safety; and reactogenicity. Immune responses were observed against ancestral virus after two doses of NVX-CoV2373 but not after placebo. In both adults and adolescents, additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 increased nAb titers, anti-rS IgG levels, and hACE2-RBI; durable responses were recorded 8 months post 3rd dose. nAb responses post 3rd dose were noninferior to those post primary series. Cross-reactivity to BA.5 and BQ.1.1 variants was also observed, with anti-rS IgG levels post 3rd or 4th dose exceeding previously reported correlates of protection. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated, with no new safety signals. NVX-CoV2373 elicited robust and durable humoral immune responses to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 as a 3rd and 4th dose after the primary series in adults and adolescents. Cross-reactivity to relevant variants provides insight into potential protection against antigenically related, but shifted, viral strains. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated with no new safety signals.

10.1016/j.epidem.2025.100836,Integrative modeling of the spread of serious infectious diseases and corresponding wastewater dynamics.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the critical need for accurate disease modeling to inform public health interventions. Traditional reliance on confirmed infection data is often hindered by reporting delays and under-reporting, while antigen or antibody testing of a full cohort can be costly and impractical. Wastewater-based surveillance offers a promising alternative by detecting viral concentrations from fecal shedding, potentially providing a more accurate estimate of true infection prevalence. However, challenges remain in optimizing sampling protocols, locations, and normalization strategies, particularly in accounting for environmental factors like precipitation. We present an integrative model that simulates the spread of serious infectious diseases by linking detailed infection dynamics with wastewater processes through viral shedding curves. Through comprehensive simulations, we examine how virus characteristics, precipitation events, measurement protocols, and normalization strategies affect the relationship between infection dynamics and wastewater measurements. Our findings reveal a complex relationship between disease prevalence and corresponding wastewater concentrations, with key variability sources including upstream sampling locations, continuous rainfall, and rapid viral decay. Notably, we find that flow rate normalization can be unreliable when rainwater infiltrates sewer systems. Despite these challenges, our study demonstrates that wastewater-based surveillance data can serve as a leading indicator of disease prevalence, predicting outbreak peaks before they occur. The proposed integrative model can thus be used to optimize wastewater-based surveillance, enhancing its utility for public health monitoring.","The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the critical need for accurate disease modeling to inform public health interventions.

In 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency released an Enterococcus qPCR protocol for recreational water quality testing. Over the past decade, there have been multiple advances in qPCR-based environmental testing, affording the opportunity to update the current methodology. A streamlined Enterococcus qPCR protocol is introduced that simplifies the mathematical model to estimate target sequence concentrations (TSC), reduces sample testing time by 20 min, incorporates a certified control material for standard curve generation, and introduces an inactivated E. faecalis whole cell DNA standard (WCDS) control material. A series of experiments were conducted 1) to compare results of the two Enterococcus qPCR protocols in analysis of marine, estuarine, and freshwater samples (n = 60), 2) to investigate alternative sources for sample processing control baseline measurements to identify and adjust results due to potential water sample matrix interference, and 3) to evaluate the performance, homogeneity, and stability of an inactivated E. faecalis cell preparation as a WCDS control material. Findings indicate a strong correlation between water sample mean log<sub>10</sub> TSC per reaction paired measurements (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.980) and 100 % agreement in amplification and sample processing control tests. A Bayesian approach that accounts for uncertainty in qPCR measurements confirmed statistical equivalence for all water samples yielding paired measurements in the range of quantification, with 72.7 % of samples exhibiting reduced error with the new streamlined protocol.

Based on sEMG, the Glazer protocol was developed over 20 years ago with a limited sample size, making it challenging to accurately diagnose PFDs across diverse populations and conditions. This study aims to establish a multidimensional database for monitoring pelvic floor sEMG, derive more reasonable reference ranges for sEMG parameters, and achieve accurate diagnosis of PFDs through artificial intelligence (AI). In this population-based, multicenter, cross-sectional study, we recruited 1605 participants from 21 centres across China, collected pelvic floor sEMG data, and established a multidimensional sEMG database. Based on the database, we developed an AI-Diagnostician-PFD diagnostic model, which leverages AI to derive AI-Reference ranges for sEMG parameters and diagnose PFDs. Data from 15 centres were divided into a training dataset (60%) and a test dataset (40%), while data from 6 additional centres were used to form an independent validation dataset. The proportions of normal and abnormal samples were consistent across the 15 and 6 centres, ensuring balanced representation. Additionally, both datasets encompassed diverse geographical regions, enhancing the model's generalizability. The diagnostic performance of the AI-Diagnostician-PFD model was evaluated on both the internal test dataset and the external validation dataset. In the external validation dataset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the AI-Reference ranges was 11% higher than that of the Glazer standard.

The IBV genome load was significantly higher in the lungs of the FW-infected when compared to TW-infected group at 4 days post-infection (dpi). The histopathological lesion scores in the trachea and lungs were higher in the FW-infected birds when compared to the uninfected controls at observed time points. However, the histopathological lesion scores in the trachea and lungs of the TW-infected birds were not different when compared to that of FW-infected group. In the lungs, the CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations were significantly higher in the TW-infected group at observed time points when compared to uninfected controls. However, the CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations in lungs of the FW-infected birds were not different when compared to that of TW-infected group. In the spleen, CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations were significantly higher in TW-infected and FW-infected birds when compared to uninfected controls depending on the observed time point and we did not observe differences in CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations in spleen between TW-infected and FW-infected birds. These findings suggest that sub-optimal drinking water can exacerbate IBV infection by weakening immune responses and increasing disease severity. Further studies are necessary to observe the effect of suboptimal water quality on the development of vaccine-mediated immune response. Understanding these interactions is key for improving water management strategies for maintaining poultry health and productivity.","This study investigated the impact of poor drinking water quality on infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) pathogenesis. Drinking water samples from Alberta layer farms were assessed based on physical, chemical, and microbiological properties.

10.1016/j.ijmm.2025.151656,From crisis to routine - Standardization of SARS-CoV-2 genome detection by enhanced EQA schemes in a scientific pandemic network.,"In the beginning of 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a crisis in which diagnostic methods for the genome detection of SARS-CoV-2 were urgently needed. Based on the very early publication of the basic principles for a diagnostic test for the genome detection of SARS-CoV-2, the first noncommercial laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) and commercial tests were introduced. As there was considerable uncertainty about the reliability and performance of different tests and different laboratories, INSTAND established external quality assessment (EQA) schemes for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 starting in April 2020. In close partnership in a scientific network, the EQA schemes were enhanced, especially the April, June and November 2020 terms. The enhancement included: (i) immediate provision of suitable virus including variants of concern at the beginning of the pandemic outbreak, (ii) short frequency of EQA schemes, (iii) concentration dependency of the testing and sensitivity check, achieved by using SARS-CoV-2-positive samples from a 10-fold dilution series of the same starting material, (iv) specificity check of the testing, achieved by using SARS-CoV-2-negative samples containing human coronaviruses or MERS CoV, (v) revealed samples for orientation on test performance during an ongoing or at the start of an EQA scheme using a pre-quantified SARS-CoV-2-positive EQA sample with a low viral RNA load of only 1 570 copies/mL assigned by digital PCR (dPCR) in June 2020 and (vi) quantified reference materials based on the experiences of the first two EQA schemes with dPCR-assigned values in copies/mL beginning in November 2020 for self-evaluation of the applied test system. This manuscript summarizes the results of a total of 13 EQA schemes for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 between April 2020 and June 2023 in which a total of 1 413 laboratories from 49 countries participated. The qualitative results for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples were between 95.8 % and 99.7 % correct positive, excluding extremely low concentration samples. For all SARS-CoV-2-negative EQA samples, the qualitative success rates ranged from 95.1 % to 99.4 % correct negative results. The widely varying values for the cycle threshold (Ct)/crossing point (Cq) reported for the different target genes and test systems were striking. A few laboratories reported quantitative results in copies/mL for several VOCs with an acceptable rate of over 93 % correct positive results in the majority of cases. The description of the enhanced EQA schemes for SARS-CoV-2 detection in terms of timing and scope can serve as a blueprint for the rapid development of a quality assessment of diagnostics for an emerging pathogen.","In the beginning of 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a crisis in which diagnostic methods for the genome detection of SARS-CoV-2 were urgently needed.

10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.110502,A pilot study for virus-induced neural network remodeling in sudden hearing loss and tinnitus: A graph attention network approach.,"This study aimed to investigate early central abnormalities in sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) and tinnitus following viral infection, specifically associated with SARS-CoV-2. We sought to identify shared and distinct functional connectivity (FC) features across SSNHL and tinnitus patients with and without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore how virus influences brain network remodeling in SSNHL and tinnitus. We recruited 31 SSNHL patients with tinnitus following SARS-CoV-2 infection (COV-SSNHL), 32 non-viral SSNHL patients with tinnitus, and 32 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). Brain functional connectivity coefficients were used to construct graph data analyzed with a graph attention network (GAT) model for categorization. Analyses focused on the auditory network (AN), salience network (SN), and default mode network (DMN) and their correlations with tinnitus severity. Both SSNHL groups showed reduced connectivity within the SN and DMN, which correlated with tinnitus severity. Notably, COV-SSNHL patients exhibited distinct, complex network remodeling involving the AN, SN, and DMN, with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) as a central mediator. This remodeling facilitated interactions within the SN and across networks, marking COV-SSNHL as neurologically unique. This study highlights the distinct neural alterations in brain networks in COV-SSNHL patients, providing novel insights into the pathophysiology of viral-induced SSNHL and tinnitus. These findings suggest potential therapeutic targets and contribute to understanding the central mechanisms underlying these conditions.","This study aimed to investigate early central abnormalities in sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) and tinnitus following viral infection, specifically associated with SARS-CoV-2.

10.1016/j.jpba.2025.117010,A biomarker identified by integrated bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue lipidomics mitigates respiratory syncytial virus infection.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a highly pathogenic respiratory virus that severely impacts infants under 2 years, adults over 60, and immunocompromised individuals. Currently, no safe, low-toxicity, or cost-effective therapy is available for RSV. Research indicates that RSV infection disrupts pulmonary surfactant lipid metabolism. Through lipidomic analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue, we observed an increase in most phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), while all phosphatidylglycerols (PGs) decreased. Additionally, all lysophospholipids in lung tissue increased. Among the altered lipids, 27 showed significant changes in both BAL fluid and lung tissue, including 15 phospholipids (7 PCs, 5 PEs, 3 PGs, and 1 phosphatidylinositol (PI)). From the decreased PGs, we identified an active lipid, PG 16:0-18:2, which correlated strongly between BAL fluid and lung tissue. Further studies confirmed that PG 16:0-18:2 significantly reduces viral load, mitigates RSV-induced lung damage, and reduces pulmonary inflammation. In vitro experiments demonstrated that PG 16:0-18:2 directly inhibits RSV replication and proliferation in epithelial cells. These findings suggest that PG 16:0-18:2 could serve as an effective and non-toxic antiviral agent, offering a promising complementary approach to RSV treatment.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a highly pathogenic respiratory virus that severely impacts infants under 2 years, adults over 60, and immunocompromised individuals.

Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) play a crucial role in controlling viral infections; however, their protective potential against FAdV-4 infections remains largely unknown. In this study, we systematically identified 482 type I and 107 type III ISGs with potential anti-FAdV-4 activity in chickens using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), of which 98 were shared by both types, and the expression level of the two types of ISGs was different, such as interferon alpha inducible protein 6 (IFI6). Functional analysis using Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes revealed that these ISGs are involved in multiple essential biological processes, metabolic activities, signaling pathways, and immune regulations, suggesting their roles in host-virus interactions and cellular regulatory mechanisms. Heatmap analysis of gene expression profiles showed significant differences in ISG expression between interferon-alpha (ChIFN-α) and interferon-lambda (ChIFN-λ) treatment groups following FAdV-4 infection. Protein interaction analysis indicated that IFI6 is highly connected to multiple immune-related proteins. Notably, IFI6 exhibited the highest expression among the co-expressed genes. Functional validation demonstrated that IFI6 overexpression significantly suppressed FAdV-4 replication, while interference with IFI6 expression enhanced viral propagation. This study provides a comprehensive ISG resource for investigating antiviral responses in chickens and is the first to identify the antiviral activity of IFI6 against FAdV-4. These findings support future antiviral development and prevention and control measures for FAdV-4 infections in poultry.","Fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) is a highly destructive pathogen that causes hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS), leading to substantial economic losses in the global poultry industry.

In Santa Catarina, southern Brazil, it was exotic until 2020, when it was diagnosed in a commercial layer farm in São Ludgero/SC. This study consists of two phases: the first assesses ILT prevalence in municipalities near São Ludgero in 2020, while the second examines the entire state of Santa Catarina in 2021. A total of 44 farms were sampled in 2020 and 49 in 2021, including commercial layer and rearing farms. Twenty chickens per farm were sampled for serology, and 10 were euthanized for necropsy, respiratory organ collection and histopathological evaluation. Conjunctiva, larynx, trachea, and trigeminal ganglion samples were subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for ILT virus. Fisher's exact test and multivariate logistic regression (α=0.05) were applied to identify risk factors. In 2020, 95.4 % of farms were seropositive, and 88.1 % of seropositive farms tested qPCR-positive. In 2021, these rates were 65.3 % and 21.8 %, respectively. Syncytial cells and intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed in three farms (7.1 %) in 2020 but were absent in 2021. Multivariate analysis confirmed flock replacement with older chickens as a significant risk factor for ILT in 2021 (p < 0.05).

However, M. armatus, as a carnivorous fish, needs to be trained to feed during the juvenile period in order to save the culture cost, so as to improve its culture efficiency. However, with the increasing price of fishmeal and the higher amount of harmful bacteria in the water body, the development of M. armatus aquaculture is seriously constrained. Therefore, in this experiment, different proportions of Spirulina platensis (0, 5 %,10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %) were used to replace fishmeal and fed to M. armatus seedlings during the period of dietary transition. Finally, M. armatus was infected with Aeromonas hydrophila to investigate the effect of S. platensis on the immunity of M. armatus. The results showed that S. platensis significantly reduced the damage caused by A. hydrophila to the liver of M. armatus. S. platensis could improve the antioxidant capacity of the organism by increasing the activities of T-SOD, GSH-px and T-AOC, as well as decreasing the activity of MDA. The transcriptome showed that S. platensis could activate the hepatic activation of Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis and AMPK signaling pathway. In the Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis pathway, the gpi, pfkl and pfkp genes had the strongest correlation with other genes. Metabolomic results showed that S. platensis activates pathways such as Nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism and Arginine and proline metabolism. In conclusion, S. platensis can effectively improve the infection tolerance of M. armatus against A. hydrophila.

10.1093/nar/gkaf481,Selective engineering of condensation properties of single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) protein via its intrinsically disordered linker region.,"Single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) proteins are essential components of genome metabolism in both bacteria and eukaryotes. Recently demonstrated condensation propensities have placed SSB functions in a new context regarding the organization of nucleic acid-modifying complexes. In this work, we provide functional dissection of the condensation and partner binding properties of Escherichia coli (Ec) SSB via engineered modifications of its intrinsically disordered linker (IDL) region. We identify specific alterations in two glycine-rich regions as well as aromatic and/or positively charged residues of the IDL by which a broad-range, selective modification of condensation propensity and condensate thermal and chemical stability can be achieved, while leaving the single-stranded DNA and partner protein binding functions of SSB unchanged. AlphaFold 3-predicted structures of tetrameric wild-type and engineered EcSSB constructs identify multiple possible binding sites for the conserved C-terminal tip on the tetramer core of the IDL, establishing a link between condensation propensity and restrictions in IDL conformational dynamics. Besides defining the contributions of IDL-driven interactions to driving protein condensation, these results pave the way for the definition of in vivo roles of EcSSB condensation via genetic engineering and delineate ways for further development of liquid-liquid phase separation prediction algorithms.","Single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) proteins are essential components of genome metabolism in both bacteria and eukaryotes.

The pattern of perturbations reveals couplings between regions of the RNA sequence, from which we infer connections as well as their prevalences in the population, without reference to folding models. We validate this patch-probe method using the 1058-nucleotide RNA genome of satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV), which has been shown to have multiple long-range connections. Our results not only indicate long-range connections that agree with previous structures but also reveal the prevalence of competing connections. Together, these results suggest that multiple structures with different connectivity coexist in solution. Furthermore, we show that the prevalence of certain connections changes when pseudouridine, an important component of natural and synthetic RNAs, is substituted for uridine in STMV RNA, and that the connectivity of STMV minus strands is qualitatively distinct from that of plus strands. Finally, we use a simplified version of the method to validate a predicted 317-nucleotide connection within the 3569-nucleotide RNA genome of bacteriophage MS2.","We describe a DNA-array-based method to infer intramolecular connections in a population of RNA molecules in vitro.

10.1021/acschembio.5c00286,Identification and Characterization of the Biosynthesis of the Hybrid NRPS-NIS Siderophore Nocardichelin.,"Bacteria cope with the limitation of iron by producing siderophores, small molecules they export that have high affinity for iron. Once complexed, the ferric siderophore is transported into the cell through specialized receptors allowing the iron to be released and used in a variety of biological processes. Many peptide siderophores that use catechol, phenolate, or oxazoline/thiazoline groups to coordinate iron are produced by a family of enzymes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Alternately, a smaller family of NRPS-independent siderophores (NISs) is produced by a different biosynthetic strategy.

Once complexed, the ferric siderophore is transported into the cell through specialized receptors allowing the iron to be released and used in a variety of biological processes. Many peptide siderophores that use catechol, phenolate, or oxazoline/thiazoline groups to coordinate iron are produced by a family of enzymes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Alternately, a smaller family of NRPS-independent siderophores (NISs) is produced by a different biosynthetic strategy.

,Deficient FANCL Predisposes Endothelial Damage: A New Therapeutic Target for Pulmonary Hypertension.,"Clinical observations have suggested an association between alkylating agents-based chemotherapy and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, principal mechanism for resolving alkylating agent-induced DNA damage, has been implicated in this process. To establish the interplay among FA pathway, DNA damage and PAH. A knockout-first mouse model for FA complementation group L (<i>Fancl</i><sup>kf/kf</sup>) and an adeno-associated virus 9-mediated <i>Fancl</i> overexpression (AAV-<i>Fancl</i>) model were used. Lung specimens, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAECs) from patients with PAH, and primarily cultured pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) from wild-type and <i>Fancl</i><sup>kf/kf</sup> mice were analyzed. Data analysis on lung single-cell RNA sequencing datasets revealed significant downregulation of <i>FANCL</i> in endothelial cells from idiopathic PAH (IPAH) patients, a finding consistently validated in both clinical samples (lung specimens and PAECs) and the monocrotaline-induced PAH rat model. Notably, <i>Fancl</i><sup>kf/kf</sup> mice developed spontaneous PAH and showed heightened susceptibility to alkylating agent (mitomycin C)-induced PAH, characterized by severe DNA damage and apoptosis in PMVECs. These pathological phenotypes were rescued through <i>Fancl</i> gene supplementation via AAV-<i>Fancl</i> or pharmacological intervention with the DNA damage protector amifostine. Mechanistically, transcriptomic profiling combined with functional validation demonstrated a suppressed bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling coupled with hyperactivated transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathways in PMVECs from <i>Fancl</i><sup>kf/kf</sup> mice. Importantly, this imbalance was fully restored in PMVECs from AAV-<i>Fancl</i>-treated mice.

To date, no versatile technology has been developed to directly label and visualize an active replicase in live plant cells because, in general, replicase function is not retained when it is fused to a protein for fluorescence imaging. We developed a technique to label and image a plant virus replicase during infection using the transiently expressed human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) frankenbody (FB), an antibody fragment that binds the HA epitope. The function of FB was demonstrated by visualizing the targeting of mCherry-fused FB (FB-mCherry) to an HA-tagged and GFP-fused endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker protein in its native location. The combination of a two-component inducible system with the FB probe enabled FB-mCherry to label an HA epitope-tagged, functional replicase of Plantago asiatica mosaic virus (PlAMV) during its infection in Nicotiana benthamiana cells without affecting virus replication efficiency. The HA-tagged PlAMV replicase forms punctate structures associated with the ER and plasmodesmata and is localized in the vicinity of dsRNA, a hallmark of a viral replication complex. This application of epitope tag-binding intracellular probes for live subcellular imaging in plant cells offers insights into the localization dynamics of an active plant virus replicase during infection and the potential to co-localize host factors with the active replicase in situ.","Replication of plant positive-strand RNA viruses occurs in association with intracellular membranes.

We used negative binomial time-series models regressing weekly antibiotic prescriptions against RSV and influenza circulation measures to estimate counterfactual rates of antibiotic prescriptions in the presence and absence of RSV and influenza circulation overall, by age group, census division, and antibiotic class. We considered syndromic (medical claims) and laboratory (National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System) RSV and influenza measures and controlled for age, division, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction, and seasonal and secular trends. An estimated 6.3% (95% confidence interval 5.2-7.3%) and 3.4% (3.1-3.8%) of antibiotic prescriptions were associated with RSV and influenza, respectively. These estimates translate to 72.6 (59.7-85.9) RSV-associated and 40.0 (35.1-45.1) influenza-associated antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 children annually. RSV-associated antibiotic prescription incidence was highest among children aged ≤5 years while influenza-associated antibiotic prescriptions were highest among children >5 years.

After defining a classical nuclear limit that is consistent with the quantum-classical equilibrium, we include nuclear quantum effects through a variational polaron transformation of the high-frequency vibrational modes. This approach is validated by comparison with fully quantum-mechanical benchmark calculations and applied to three prototypical light-harvesting complexes. For light-harvesting complex 2 of purple bacteria, the inter-ring transfer is 1.5 times slower in the quantum treatment than in the classical treatment. For the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex, the transfer rate is the same in both cases, whereas for light-harvesting complex II of spinach, the transfer is 1.7 times slower in the quantum treatment. The effect is most pronounced for systems with large excitonic energy gaps and strong vibronic coupling to high-frequency modes. In all cases, nuclear quantum effects are found to be unimportant for the directionality of energy transfer.","We assess how quantum-mechanical effects associated with high-frequency chromophore vibrations influence excitation energy transfer in biological light-harvesting complexes.

We report that the antimicrobial activity of chemokines is defined by their ability to bind phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, two anionic phospholipids commonly found in the bacterial plasma membrane. We show that only chemokines able to bind these two phospholipids kill bacteria and that they exert rapid bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects with a higher potency than the antimicrobial peptide β-defensin 3. Both biochemical and genetic interference with the chemokine-cardiolipin interaction impaired microbial growth arrest, bacterial killing, and membrane disruption by chemokines. Moreover, unlike conventional antibiotics, <i>Escherichia coli</i> failed to develop resistance when placed under increasing antimicrobial chemokine pressure in vitro.

Here, we report a small luminescent molecule, TPA2PyPh, as a potent antibacterial agent and its potential for lipid droplet-engineered macrophage transfer strategy in treating bacterial sepsis. Engineered macrophages, created by directly incubating TPA2PyPh with macrophages, enabled the luminogen to precisely bind to intracellular lipid droplets. Upon engulfment of bacteria, these TPA2PyPh-loaded macrophages use natural lipid uptake mechanisms to deliver the luminogen to intracellular bacteria, disrupting their membranes and inserting into the bacterial DNA, thereby inducing bacterial elimination. Our findings show that the adoptive transfer of TPA2PyPh-loaded macrophages substantially diminishes bacterial burden in septic mice and substantially reduces mortality rates.

Since 2011, concerns have arisen about increased melanoma risk in PDE5 inhibitor users. PDE5 inhibitors affect the rat sarcoma virus oncogene-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma-mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling cascade, which is involved in melanoma formation. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates melanoma risk in PDE5 inhibitor users. PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase were searched to examine the relationship between PDE5 inhibitors and melanoma. A random-effects model estimated pooled odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs), with the I ² statistic assessing heterogeneity. RStudio v4.4.2 was used for the meta-analysis, and a P value less than 0.05 was deemed significant. Eight studies including 7 620 765 patients were analyzed, with 2 123 165 (27.86%) comprising the PDE5 inhibitor-exposed group. The meta-analysis found a relationship between PDE5 inhibitor use and increased melanoma risk [OR: 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-2.27, P = 0.009, I ² = 98%] and [HR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.17, P = 0.005, I ² = 43%]. When each PDE5 inhibitor was examined separately, increased melanoma incidence was observed, though not statistically significant. The OR for sildenafil was 1.85 (95% CI: 0.97-3.51, P = 0.059, I ² = 99%), tadalafil 1.54 (95% CI: 0.79-3.00, P = 0.203, I ² = 96%), and vardenafil 1.16 (95% CI: 0.82-1.64, P = 0.391, I ² = 89%).

The serine/threonine phosphatase RsbU initiates the General Stress Response in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> upon binding a partner protein (RsbT) that is released from sequestration by environmental stresses. We report that RsbT activates RsbU by inducing otherwise flexible linkers of RsbU to form a short coiled-coil that dimerizes and activates the phosphatase domains. Importantly, we present evidence that related coiled-coil linkers and phosphatase dimers transduce signals from diverse sensor domains to control the General Stress Response and other signaling across bacterial phyla. This coiled-coil linker transduction mechanism additionally suggests a resolution to the mystery of how shared sensory domains control serine/threonine phosphatases, diguanylate cyclases and histidine kinases. We propose that this provides bacteria with a modularly exchangeable toolkit for the evolution of diverse signaling pathways.","The General Stress Response promotes survival of bacteria in adverse conditions, but how sensor proteins transduce species-specific signals to initiate the response is not known.

Data collection was retrieved from the medical records of the patients. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software, version 30.0. This study has considered all ethical measures. Among a total of 1069 children tested, 19.7% tested positive for influenza A, 11.9% for influenza B, and 13.8% for RSV. The study found that young infants were significantly less susceptible to contracting these viruses compared to older children and adolescents (p < 0.001). A statistically significant difference in the odds of testing positive was observed between the two hospitals (p = 0.011), and a significant temporal trend in influenza circulation was noted (p < 0.05).

Many viruses induce oxidative stress and degrade peroxisomes, but the mechanisms and consequences remain unclear. In this study, we systematically investigate how virus-induced pexophagy regulates peroxisome homeostasis. Using Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a model, we demonstrate that NDV infection triggers excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, activating the phosphorylation and peroxisomal localization of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM). Activated ATM promotes the interaction between the peroxisomal receptor PEX5 and the autophagy receptor p62, driving pexophagy. Pexophagy-mediated peroxisome degradation leads to excess active iron and ROS accumulation, contributing to NDV-induced ferroptosis. Notably, this mechanism is shared by other viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus and H9N2 avian influenza virus.

The NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein plays a vital role in the replication of the hepatitis C virus as the main RNA-synthesizing enzyme. It is crucial for forming new viral RNA, making it an ideal target for antiviral drugs. Inhibiting NS5B can inhibit virus replication, potentially preventing severe liver diseases, including cancer. Scientists have mapped the structure of the NS5B RdRp, revealing how different inhibitors interact with it, guiding the creation of targeted drugs. Nigella sativa, known for diverse bioactive compounds, is now being explored for its potential to combat viruses. Our research aims to determine whether compounds extracted from Nigella sativa can inhibit the NS5B RdRp enzyme of HCV. Through advanced computational analysis and molecular docking, Nigella sativa's phytoconstituents were scrutinized for their ability to bind and potentially inhibit NS5B RdRp. Amentoflavone, Rutin, and Catechin were selected based on their pharmacokinetic and enzyme-binding properties, which prompted further examination. Thorough molecular dynamics simulations affirmed the formation of stable complexes between these molecules and NS5B RdRp and provided valuable information about their influence on the enzyme's structural stability. The findings suggest these compounds have potent inhibitory actions, highlighting them as potential natural medicinal options against hepatitis C.","The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small, enveloped virus characterized by a positive-sense single-stranded RNA belonging to the Flaviviridae family.

Although JAR1 has been characterized in several plant species, its regulatory function in mediating JA signaling to modulate the biosynthesis of terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) in Catharanthus roseus, a medicinal and ornamental plant, have not been previously investigated. In this study, we have identified and cloned CrJAR1, a member of the Gretchen Hagen3 (GH3) gene family, from C. roseus and confirmed its enzymatic activity in JA-Ile formation via heterologous expression in E. coli. Functional analyses using transient overexpression and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in C. roseus leaves revealed that CrJAR1 positively regulates the accumulation of catharanthine and vindoline. Moreover, we demonstrated that CrCOI1, the jasmonate receptor, functions synergistically with CrJAR1 in modulating TIA biosynthesis. Co-silencing of CrCOI1 and CrJAR1 resulted in a lower sensitivity to exogenous JA treatment compared to silencing of CrJAR1 alone, indicating distinct yet complementary roles in jasmonate-mediated metabolic regulation. These results advance our understanding the function of CrJAR1 and offer new strategies for engineering specialized metabolite biosynthesis in plants.","Jasmonate resistant 1 (JAR1), which encodes a jasmonate-amino synthase, mediates the biosynthesis of jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), the bioactive form of jasmonate involved in JA signal transduction pathway.

Chitin has become the target for biocontrol of these pests as an alternative to chemical pesticides. Thus, this study aims to isolate and characterise chitin-degrading bacteria from soil using dual screening approaches and poisoned food agar assay. Seven bacteria were isolated from soil samples. The selection of chitin-degrading bacteria was carried out using dual screening methods. Screening via agar well diffusion assay showed that isolate FS2 exhibited the largest halo zone diameter at 30.83 mm, followed by FS1. However, only isolate FS1 exhibited chitin degradation in the secondary screening via shrimp shell degradation. Thus, the antifungal activity of isolate FS1 was further investigated via the poisoned food agar assay involving cell-free supernatant (CFS) and bacterial culture against Curvularia lunata and Colletotrichum truncatum, which yielded the highest growth inhibition by CFS against C. lunata at 18.33 mm. Media culture screening exhibited that isolate FS1 in Trypticase Soy Broth showed the highest chitinase activity at 25.33 mm via agar well diffusion assay. Next, isolate FS1 at 3% of chitin yielded the highest chitinase activity at 350.30 U/mL. This isolate was further identified as Paenibacillus alvei with 99.79% accuracy via 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic tree construction. These findings revealed that P. alvei FS1, isolated from soil, can degrade chitin and may be considered a potential biocontrol agent for insect and fungal pathogens in agriculture.","Agricultural pests, such as insects and fungi, contain chitin in their exoskeleton and cell walls, respectively.

Further, we optimized the effect of temperature and growth media on the expression of ZIKV rEDIII. Our study establishes a systematic protocol for extracting functional ZIKV rEDIII since the majority of the expressed protein goes into inclusion bodies (IBs). We have optimized the refolding process of rEDIII in buffers with varying pH levels and demonstrated the association between the buffer environment and the refolding efficiency of ZIKV rEDIII. Among these, Tris-HCl pH 8.8 buffer successfully restored the native conformation of ZIKV rEDIII, as confirmed by CD spectroscopy. We further confirmed the biological activity of refolded ZIKV rEDIII protein by inhibiting ZIKV entry into the host cells in an in vitro competitive viral inhibition assay. Our study proposes suitable conditions required for refolding bacterially expressed ZIKV rEDIII protein into its functionally active form with a median 50% inhibitory dose (ID50) value of 29 µg.

Comparison and analysis of soil metagenome from clustered and depopulated groups distinguished by toad behavior showed differences of bacterial community composition (e.g., Proteobacteria bacterium TMED72 and Nannocystis exedens) and antibiotic resistance genes involving antibiotic efflux and inactivation (e.g., mdtB and acrF).

In Nannocystis exedens, one of the distribution-typical genes was annotated as 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase acting role on bacterial growth restriction. It implied that, compared with the group emerging rare traces, the reduction of soil bacteria which possess genes retarding bacterial growth putatively impairs competitiveness to pathogenic bacteria and results in poor survivability of toads under clustering behavior.

Plaque control and maintenance of local periodontal immune homeostasis are crucial for treating periodontitis and achieving bone regeneration. In this study, we prepared a pH/ROS dual-responsive hydrogel system (CDFBCS@SA) composed of modified carboxymethyl cellulose (CMCDA) and carboxymethyl chitosan (CCS) through dynamic chemical crosslinking to load sinapic acid (SA), a natural phenolic acid with antibacterial and immunomodulatory properties. This hydrogel system can dynamically regulate the long-term and precise release of SA, effectively improve the periodontal inflammatory microenvironment, and enhance its effects in the periodontal microenvironment. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments demonstrated that this hydrogel system maintains local periodontal immune homeostasis by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors, reducing oxidative stress, and regulating macrophage polarization, thereby providing a favorable environment for bone regeneration in the inflammatory periodontal environment and significantly enhancing the regenerative effect of periodontal bone defects. This dynamic cross-linked hydrogel system incorporating SA provides an effective strategy for the regenerative treatment of periodontal bone defects.","Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the structures supporting teeth, primarily induced by bacteria.

10.1021/acs.jcim.5c00306,AVP-HNCL: Innovative Contrastive Learning with a Queue-Based Negative Sampling Strategy for Dual-Phase Antiviral Peptide Prediction.,"Viral infections have long been a core focus in the field of public health. Antiviral peptides (AVPs), due to their unique mechanisms of action and significant inhibitory effects against a wide range of viruses, exhibit tremendous potential in protecting organisms from various viral diseases. However, existing studies on antiviral peptide recognition often rely on feature selection. As data volume continues to grow and task complexity increases, traditional methods are increasingly showing limitations in feature extraction capabilities and model generalization performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose an innovative two-stage predictive framework that integrates the ESM2 model, data augmentation, feature fusion, and contrastive learning techniques. This framework enables simultaneous identification of AVPs and their subclasses. By introducing a novel top-k queue-based contrastive learning strategy, the framework significantly improves the model's accuracy in distinguishing challenging positive and negative samples and its generalization performance. This approach provides robust theoretical support and technical tools for advancing research on antiviral peptides. Model evaluation results show that on Set 1-nonAVP, the framework achieves an accuracy of 0.9362 and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) score of 0.8730. On the Set 2-nonAMP, the model achieves perfect accuracy (1.0000) and an MCC score of 1.0000. In addition, during the second stage, the model accurately predicts the antiviral activity of antiviral peptides against six major virus families and eight specific viruses. To further enhance accessibility for users, we have developed a user-friendly web interface, available at http://www.bioai-lab.com/AVP-HNCL.","Viral infections have long been a core focus in the field of public health.

While long-term nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) therapy effectively suppresses viral replication, achieving a functional cure remains rare. Current treatment guidelines primarily recommend indefinite therapy. However, long-term NA use poses many challenges, prompting interest in finite therapy. Recent studies suggest that carefully selected patients may safely discontinue NAs, leading to a functional cure in some cases. This review evaluates the latest evidence on NA discontinuation, highlighting key factors influencing outcomes. This review synthesises established and emerging evidence on NA discontinuation in CHB. It explores early studies that identified quantitative HBsAg (qHBsAg) as a predictor of sustained response and HBsAg seroclearance, followed by systematic reviews and meta-analyses reinforcing finite therapy as a feasible approach. Advances in predictive modelling, incorporating biomarkers, have refined patient selection for safe NA withdrawal. Additionally, this review assesses the risks associated with NA discontinuation, highlighting the importance of identifying high-risk patients for hepatic decompensation. Ethnicity-specific qHBsAg cut-offs are also discussed, recognising variations in treatment response between Asian and Caucasian populations. Finite NA therapy is emerging as a viable approach for achieving functional cure. Future strategies should integrate liver fibrosis assessment to enhance patient selection before NA discontinuation. Optimising re-treatment approaches requires balancing timing, immune response, and qHBsAg kinetics to maximise HBsAg seroclearance. Clinical perspectives on NA discontinuation remain a key research priority, necessitating standardised guidelines and improved post-NA monitoring strategies to ensure safe and effective finite therapy in CHB management.","Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains a global health challenge, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality.

10.1093/molbev/msaf115,Tripartite loops reverse antibiotic resistance.,"Antibiotic resistance threatens to undo many of the advancements of modern medicine. A slow antibiotic development pipeline makes it impossible to outpace bacterial evolution, making alternative strategies essential to combat resistance. In this study, we introduce cyclic antibiotic regimens composed of three drugs or ""tripartite loops"" to contain resistance within a closed drug cycle. Through 424 discrete adaptive laboratory evolution experiments we show that as bacteria sequentially evolve resistance to the drugs in a loop, they continually trade their past resistance for fitness gains, reverting back to sensitivity. Through fitness and genomic analyses, we find that tripartite loops guide bacterial strains towards evolutionary paths that mitigate fitness costs and reverse resistance to component drugs in the loops and drive levels of resensitization not achievable through previously suggested pairwise regimens. We then apply this strategy to reproducibly resensitize or eradicate four drug-resistant clinical isolates over the course of 216 evolutionary experiments. Resensitization occurred even when bacteria adapted through plasmid-bound mutations instead of chromosomal changes. Combined, these findings outline a sequential antibiotic regimen with high resensitization frequencies which may improve the clinical longevity of existing antibiotics even in the face of antibiotic resistance.","Antibiotic resistance threatens to undo many of the advancements of modern medicine.

These entry factors are cell-specific and can include cell surface lectins and phosphatidylserine receptors. Niemann-Pick type C1 is critical to the late stage of the entry process. Entry has been demonstrated to be enhanced by interactions between the virion and surface-expressed lectins, which interact with carbohydrate moieties attached to the GP. In addition, soluble lectins, including mannose-binding lectin, can enhance entry <i>in vitro</i>. However, the mechanism of lectin-mediated enhancement remains to be defined. This study investigated the possibility that plant lectins, <i>Wisteria floribunda</i> agglutinin (WFA), soybean agglutinin (SBA) and <i>Galanthus nivalis</i> agglutinin (GNA), which possess different carbohydrate-binding specificities, influence EBOV entry. WFA was observed to potently enhance entry of lentiviral pseudotype viruses (PVs) expressing the GP of three <i>Ebolavirus</i> species [Zaire, Sudan (<i>Sudan ebolavirus</i>) and Reston (<i>Reston ebolavirus</i>)], with the greatest impact on EBOV. SBA had a modest enhancing effect on entry that was specific to EBOV, whilst GNA had no impact on the entry of any of the <i>Ebolavirus</i> species. None of the lectins enhanced the entry of control PVs expressing the surface proteins of other RNA viruses tested. WFA was demonstrated to bind directly with the EBOV-GP via the glycans, and mutational analysis implicated N<sup>238</sup> as contributing to the interaction. Furthermore, enhancement was observed in both human and bat cell lines, indicating a highly conserved mechanism of action. We conclude that the binding of WFA to EBOV-GP through interactions including the glycan at N<sup>238</sup> results in GP alterations that enhance entry, providing evidence of a mechanism for lectin-mediated virus entry enhancement.

While bioactive textiles using essential oils have been well-documented, the incorporation of eucalyptus leaf extracts with different surface modifications of cotton remains largely unexplored. In this line, this study investigated pretreatment approaches to improve the uptake and uniformity of eucalyptus extract on cotton fibers. To achieve this, chitosan (CH), a cationic agent, and alum were applied to the cotton fabric to promote stronger electrostatic interactions and improve the binding of extract's bioactive components. The functionalized fabrics were tested for antimicrobial activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>, and <i>Escherichia coli</i>, antioxidant properties, and cytotoxicity using human keratinocytes.

Moreover, PSDF exhibited superior water-holding capacity, swelling capacity, and cation exchange capacity compared to CSDF. These alterations in physicochemical properties contributed to enhanced biological activities of SDF. Specifically, PSDF demonstrated a more pronounced proliferative effect on Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus acidophilus. In addition, PSDF showed greater efficacy in promoting probiotic proliferation and inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria within the gut microbiota. For example, after 48 h of fermentation, the contents of Bifidobacterium longum, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis in the PSDF group were 1.12, 1.06, and 1.07 times higher than those in the CSDF group, respectively, while the content of Escherichia coli was only 80.94% of that in the CSDF group. This phenomenon was elucidated through the synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), primarily resulting from PSDF's upregulation of key enzyme expressions such as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, and phosphoglycerate kinase in the SCFAs synthesis pathways. These findings indicated UHP contributed to enhancing biological activities through altering the functional and physicochemical properties.","This study primarily investigated the effects of ultra-high pressure (UHP) treatment on the physicochemical properties and bioactivities of the soluble dietary fiber (SDF) derived from litchi pomace.

However, optimal clinical strategies for ITIT are not yet fully understood. Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) is a plant virus that is not infectious in mammals but is a powerful multi-toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist which stimulates potent antitumor immunity when used in ITIT. ITIT by transfection of interleukin-12 (IL-12) expressing plasmids into melanoma tumors <i>via</i> <i>in vivo</i> electroporation is being assessed in Phase II clinical trials to treat metastatic disease. We investigated the combination of CPMV with IL-12 plasmid electroporation to generate systemic (abscopal) immunity superior to that from either monotherapy alone. Mice were inoculated with two B16-F10 melanoma or MC38 colorectal cancer tumors and one tumor on each flank. One tumor was treated once per week for 2 weeks with IL-12 electroporation and CPMV intratumoral injection. IL-12 electroporation following CPMV injection greatly reduced the efficacy of CPMV by disrupting its viral structure. Conversely, electroporation of IL-12 prior to CPMV injection led to total clearance of 100% of treated tumors and significantly greater suppression of distant, untreated tumors compared to either monotherapy or the reverse treatment order (CPMV IT injection, followed by IL-12 electroporation). This superior abscopal effect led to a significantly improved survival. Our novel treatment strategy offers significant translational value in treating solid tumors by improving the local and systemic efficacy of IL-12 electroporation or CPMV alone.","Intratumoral immunotherapy (ITIT) delivers immune-stimulating agents or treatments directly into solid tumors to reverse the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and enables local and systemic antitumor immunity.

Herein, we found that 100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> LYC notably improved the gut transit time and intestinal transit rate as well as concurrently alleviated depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in a diphenoxylate (Dip, 5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>)-induced constipated mouse model. LYC pretreatment enhanced gut barrier integrity and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production as well as rebalanced gut microbiota homeostasis by enriching beneficial bacteria, including <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i>. Furthermore, LYC restored enteric neuronal function, as evidenced by increased HuC/D and Tuj1 expression as well as balanced neurotransmitter levels. Brain transcriptomics results suggest that LYC regulates the cholinergic synapse pathway and increases acetylcholine (Ach) content in the brain, which is associated with the alleviation of neuroinflammation. In summary, this study offers insights into functional dietary component-based nutritional strategies that target gut dysmotility comorbid behavioral dysfunction.","Gut dysmotility is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder characterized by disrupted defecation and often accompanied by depression and anxiety.

10.1111/1750-3841.70301,The Impact of Fermented Milk Products on Gut Microbiota-Derived Metabolites in Obesity: A Narrative Review.,"Obesity, a multifactorial metabolic disorder, has been increasingly linked to gut microbiota dysbiosis and its downstream metabolites. Among these, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and secondary bile acids (SBAs) play pivotal roles in energy regulation, glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation, and host-microbiota crosstalk. Fermented milk products, enriched with probiotics, prebiotics, and bioactive peptides, offer a dietary intervention capable of modulating the gut microbial community and promoting the production of beneficial metabolites. This narrative review synthesizes evidence from both animal and human studies to explore the influence of fermented milk products on SCFA and SBA production in the context of obesity. Findings suggest that fermented milk consumption enhances the abundance of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium), increases SCFA and SBA levels, improves intestinal barrier function, and contributes to improved metabolic outcomes, including reduced inflammation, improved insulin sensitivity, and favorable lipid profiles. These effects are mediated through key molecular pathways involving free fatty acid receptors, bile acid receptors, and inflammatory mediators. Further long-term, mechanistic, and population-diverse studies are essential to optimize formulations and substantiate clinical applications of fermented milk in obesity management.","Obesity, a multifactorial metabolic disorder, has been increasingly linked to gut microbiota dysbiosis and its downstream metabolites.

The Lon protease, a highly conserved ATP-dependent protease, is thought to play a central role in mitigating oxidative stress by targeting damaged and misfolded proteins for degradation. This review examines the role of Lon in oxidative stress responses, including its role in degrading oxidized proteins, regulating antioxidant pathways, and modulating heme and Fe-S cluster homeostasis. We highlight cases of substrate recognition through structural changes and describe situations where Lon activity is further regulated by redox conditions. By synthesizing studies across a range of organisms, we find that despite the clear importance of Lon for oxidative stress tolerance, universal rules for Lon degradation of damaged proteins during this response remain unclear.","Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induces oxidative stress, leading to substantial damage to cellular macromolecules, necessitating efficient protein quality control mechanisms.

10.1093/jpids/piaf055,Identifying infants at low risk for neonatal herpes simplex virus infection.,"Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is rare but associated with high rates of morbidity. Recent guidelines recommend considering HSV in infants < 21 days of age presenting for sepsis evaluations with certain risk factors. However, limited data exist on the value of these risk factors in stratifying the risk for neonatal HSV infection. We conducted a retrospective case-control study of infants < 42 days of age who presented between 1/1/08 and 12/31/23 for sepsis evaluations to identify infants at low risk for neonatal HSV infection. We used Firth logistic regression to measure the odds ratio of the presence of high-risk criteria between infants without and those with HSV infection. High risk criteria included skin vesicles, seizures, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), thrombocytopenia, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, and/or critical illness. We matched each case with control patients without neonatal HSV infection admitted within 45 days of the case. For each case, we identified 2 controls from group A, which included patients who tested negative for HSV, and 2 controls from group B, who may or may not have undergone HSV testing, but tested negative if they did. Thirty-two cases and 128 controls (64 in group A and 64 in group B) were identified. The mean age of cases was 14.3 days. The majority of cases were female, White, non-Hispanic, and born vaginally at term gestation. Controls, or infants without HSV, had lower prevalence of seizures, skin lesions, CSF pleocytosis, elevated ALT, thrombocytopenia, or critical illness compared to infants with HSV. The adjusted odds ratio of a control patient having at least one risk factor was 0.07 (95% CI 0.01 - 0.3) and 0.02 (95% CI 0 - 0.08) for control groups A and B, respectively, compared to cases. Among infants presenting for neonatal sepsis evaluations, those without HSV infection are unlikely to present with seizures, skin lesions, elevated ALT, thrombocytopenia, CSF pleocytosis, or critical illness compared to infants with HSV. The lack of these criteria can be used to guide targeted evaluation and management of neonatal HSV infection to minimize testing and treatment of low-risk infants. Neonatal HSV is rare but associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. We evaluate a set of high-risk criteria to determine if infants without these risk factors can have HSV safely excluded to avoid unnecessary testing and empiric treatment.","Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is rare but associated with high rates of morbidity.

10.1093/ismejo/wraf110,Viralization as a microbial approach for enhancing coral reef restoration.,"Coral reef ecosystems rely on microorganisms to carry out biogeochemical processes essential to the survival of corals and the reef food web. However, widespread shifts from coral to algal dominance as a result of anthropogenic pressures have promoted microbial communities that compromise reef health through deoxygenation and disease. These degraded reefs become locked in a ""microbialized"" state characterized by high microbial biomass, low oxygen, and heightened pathogenic activity that stymie efforts to outplant corals onto the reef, a common approach applied to restore these ecosystems. Over 18 months, we compared viral and microbial dynamics alongside physical and chemical parameters (""water quality"") between two coral outplanting sites and two midwater reef mesocosms called Coral Arks. Seafloor sites exhibited microbialization, whereas Arks maintained conditions with higher viral abundances and virus-to-microbe ratios, smaller and less abundant microorganisms, and consistently higher dissolved oxygen, water flow, and light availability. These conditions, which we term ""viralized"", supported enhanced coral growth and survival, greater benthic diversity, increased coral recruitment, reduced turf and macroalgae, and higher fish abundance compared to outplanting sites. Despite these benefits, analysis of microbial carbon metabolism genes revealed an underlying trend towards microbialization at both sites, reflecting larger-scale regional decline. These findings emphasize that microbial and physicochemical conditions are drivers of reef restoration outcomes; to be successful, restoration strategies must target the underlying environmental factors that support coral survival and resilience. We identify key microbial and physical variables-such as oxygen levels, flow, and viral activity-associated with viralized reef states, which should serve as focal points for developing new interventions and technologies aimed at creating conditions conducive to reef recovery.","Coral reef ecosystems rely on microorganisms to carry out biogeochemical processes essential to the survival of corals and the reef food web.

Orbiviruses that are associated with mosquitoes are a diverse group including established mosquito-borne animal pathogens such as the Peruvian horse sickness virus and phylogenetically related less well-characterized viruses isolated mostly from mammals. Although reported from various geographic regions, these viruses have not previously been detected in northern Europe. Using next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic tools, we identified two orbivirus strains from virus isolation trials of Finnish <i>Ochlerotatus communis</i> specimens performed in mosquito C6/36 cells.

The second isolate, which originated from Kevo in northern Finland, was found divergent from all publicly available orbivirus sequences and was tentatively named as Kevo orbivirus (KEVOOV).

Orbiviruses that are associated with mosquitoes are a diverse group including established mosquito-borne animal pathogens such as the Peruvian horse sickness virus and phylogenetically related less well-characterized viruses isolated mostly from mammals. Although reported from various geographic regions, these viruses have not previously been detected in northern Europe. Using next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic tools, we identified two orbivirus strains from virus isolation trials of Finnish <i>Ochlerotatus communis</i> specimens performed in mosquito C6/36 cells.

Therapeutically important antibiotics used widely in the mass medication of livestock have contributed significantly to AMR, as they eventually enter the environment due to inadequate treatment of wastewater. Similarly, improper discharge of antibiotic-contaminated waste by the medical sector exacerbates the problem by contributing to the increase in the selection of resistant bacteria and the horizontal transfer of resistance genes. Developed and developing countries and regions worldwide acknowledged that no discipline or sector of society can successfully address climate change, known and emerging infectious diseases, and AMR by acting in isolation.

Studies highlight a significant association between the lung microbiome and lung cancer, with dysbiosis potentially contributing to disease development via inflammation, immune response alterations and bacterial metabolite production. Furthermore, exposure to airborne bacteria may influence lung health by introducing pathogenic species or altering the human microbiome, thereby implicating certain dominant airborne bacteria in lung diseases, including the exacerbation of lung cancer. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) facilitate cell‑to‑cell communication, penetrating mucosal barriers to impact various organs, notably the lung. Epidemiological evidence suggests a strong relationship between the presence of microbial EVs (MEVs) in the air and chronic pulmonary diseases, with indications of a potential risk for lung cancer. MEVs play a significant role in pulmonary disease development by inducing airway inflammation and affecting lung function. The microbiome and MEVs offer considerable potential as novel tools in precision medicine for lung cancer. Biological data analysis and artificial intelligence technology advancements are pivotal for fully realizing their diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities.

Beetroot (BRT) has emerged as a promising functional food for cancer prevention and treatment, although its specific effects on breast cancer remain unclear. This study investigates the impact of BRT on polyomavirus middle T antigen (PyMT)-induced breast cancer by examining the gut microbiome, metabolites, and immune responses. Dietary supplementation of 80 g BRT powder per 1000 g of standard diet (8% w/w, 80 g per kg) significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-PyMT (FVB) mice, while simultaneously enhancing anti-tumor immunity. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that BRT supplementation altered the gut microbiota, notably increasing the abundance of <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i>. An antibiotic (ABX) experiment confirmed that BRT restores gut microbiota balance, thereby enhancing anti-tumor immunity. Metabolomics and ELISA assays demonstrated that BRT regulates diacylglycerol (DAG) biosynthesis through microbiota modulation. Notably, diacylglycerol kinase <i>ζ</i> (DGK<i>ζ</i>) inhibitors enhance CD8+ T cell responses by increasing DAG levels, thereby activating Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) and Protein Kinase C (PKC) signaling pathways. Collectively, our findings suggest that microbiota-derived DAG plays a key role in BRT-mediated enhancement of anti-tumor immunity.","Recent studies have established a strong connection between gut microbiota and the tumor immune microenvironment.

Viral oncoproteins E6 and E7, produced by HPV, serve a role in driving cellular transformation and maintaining the malignant phenotype. T cell receptor (TCR)‑like antibodies serve as a potential diagnostic tool to capture the oncogenic peptide that is present in MHC. As these antibodies serve as innate antigen detectors, orchestrating immune responses against both cell surface and intracellular proteins. In the present study, a human domain antibody (DAB) phage library was screened by evaluating synthesized HPV18 (E6 and E7) peptide‑major histocompatibility complexes (p‑MHC‑A24) to identify target‑specific TCR‑like antibodies. The present study successfully identified three TCR‑like DABs that specifically target HPV18 (E6 and E7) p‑MHC‑A24 complexes. Characterization of the amino acid sequences in the complementarity‑determining regions 1, 2 and 3 was performed using VBASE2 and the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®/vquest databases. Evaluation of soluble TCR‑like antibodies confirmed strong and selective affinity for the targets through western blotting and ELISA.

Following the results of a large randomised controlled trial, there is a need to update the previous version of this Cochrane review. To determine the effects of hormonal contraception on HIV acquisition in women who live in settings with high HIV prevalence. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, Global Index Medicus and trial registries (together with reference checking, citation searching and contacting study authors), to identify studies up to 13 September 2023. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing hormonal contraception with non-hormonal or other methods of contraception for women at high risk of HIV. Outcomes of interest were HIV acquisition, pregnancy, discontinuation of method, amenorrhoea, adverse events and condomless sexual activity. We used the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool to assess bias in the RCTs. We synthesised results for each outcome using random-effects meta-analysis where possible and meaningful. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE. We included four trials with 9726 participants, conducted across four countries. DMPA injection compared to copper intrauterine device (IUD) DMPA compared to copper IUD likely results in little to no difference in HIV acquisition (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.26; 2 RCTs, n = 6417; moderate-certainty evidence), resulting in one more woman per 1000 acquiring HIV (from 9 fewer to 13 more). DMPA compared to copper IUD results in a slight reduction in pregnancy (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.71; 1 RCT, n = 5216; high-certainty evidence), resulting in 21 fewer women per 1000 becoming pregnant (from 27 to 13 fewer). DMPA compared to copper IUD results in a reduction in discontinuation of method (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.62; 1 RCT, n = 5216; high-certainty evidence) and in adverse events (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.75; 1 RCT, n = 5216; high-certainty evidence). In the DMPA group 'any unprotected sex' was reported at 66.4% of follow-up visits, compared to 70.9% in the copper IUD group. Levonorgestrel (LNG) implant compared to copper IUD LNG compared to copper IUD likely results in little to no difference in HIV acquisition (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.06; 1 RCT, n = 5159; moderate-certainty evidence), resulting in nine fewer women per 1000 acquiring HIV (from 18 fewer to 3 more). LNG compared to copper IUD likely results in a slight reduction in pregnancy (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.89; 1 RCT, n = 5220; moderate-certainty evidence), resulting in 15 fewer women per 1000 becoming pregnant (from 22 to 5 fewer). LNG compared to copper IUD likely results in little to no difference in adverse events (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.14; 1 RCT, n = 5220; moderate-certainty evidence) and discontinuation of method (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.24; P = 0.71; 1 RCT, n = 5220; moderate-certainty evidence). DMPA injection compared to LNG implant DMPA compared to LNG probably slightly increases HIV acquisition (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.58; 1 RCT, n = 5144; moderate-certainty evidence), resulting in 11 more women per 1000 acquiring HIV (from 1 fewer to 26 more). DMPA compared to LNG probably results in little to no difference in pregnancy (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.09; 1 RCT, n = 5222; moderate-certainty evidence), resulting in seven fewer women per 1000 becoming pregnant (from 13 fewer to 3 more). DMPA compared to LNG reduces adverse events (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.90; 1 RCT, n = 5222; high-certainty evidence), and discontinuation of methods (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.60; P < 0.00001; 1 RCT, n = 5222; high-certainty evidence). No included studies in the above comparisons measured amenorrhoea. In the DMPA group 'any unprotected sex' was reported at 66.4% of follow-up visits, compared to 69.4% in the LNG implant group. DMPA injection compared to NET-EN injection The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of DMPA compared to NET-EN on HIV acquisition (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.35; 1 RCT, n = 450; very low-certainty evidence) resulting in nine fewer women per 1000 acquiring HIV (from 22 fewer to 36 more); and pregnancy (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.19 to 22.19; 1 RCT, n = 449; very low-certainty evidence), resulting in five more women per 1000 becoming pregnant (from 4 fewer to 94 more). DMPA compared to NET-EN probably increases amenorrhoea (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.41; P = 0.33; 1 RCT, n = 449; moderate-certainty evidence). Discontinuation of methods was not measured. HIV incidence was high in all groups, regardless of contraceptive used, as would be expected in a setting with high HIV prevalence. All contraceptives used in the included studies are widely used and known to prevent pregnancy. When comparing different contraceptive methods, DMPA injections compared to copper IUD may result in little to no difference in HIV acquisition and result in a slight reduction in pregnancy. LNG implants compared to copper IUDs likely result in little to no difference in HIV acquisition and in a slight reduction in pregnancy. DMPA injections compared to LNG implants likely result in a slight increase in HIV acquisition and likely result in little to no difference in pregnancy. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of DMPA compared to NET-EN on HIV acquisition and pregnancy. HIV acquisition and pregnancy are important outcomes that have a long-lasting impact. Access to safe, effective contraception is important for women wanting to prevent unplanned pregnancies, as pregnancies have long-lasting physical, social and economic ramifications. Evidence from included studies shows that across groups, many participants report engaging in condomless sexual activity, even when living in high HIV prevalence settings. HIV prevention methods such as pre-exposure prophylaxis and HIV education remain crucial in the fight against HIV. This Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.

Following the results of a large randomised controlled trial, there is a need to update the previous version of this Cochrane review. To determine the effects of hormonal contraception on HIV acquisition in women who live in settings with high HIV prevalence. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, Global Index Medicus and trial registries (together with reference checking, citation searching and contacting study authors), to identify studies up to 13 September 2023. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing hormonal contraception with non-hormonal or other methods of contraception for women at high risk of HIV. Outcomes of interest were HIV acquisition, pregnancy, discontinuation of method, amenorrhoea, adverse events and condomless sexual activity. We used the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool to assess bias in the RCTs. We synthesised results for each outcome using random-effects meta-analysis where possible and meaningful. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE. We included four trials with 9726 participants, conducted across four countries.

DMPA compared to copper IUD results in a slight reduction in pregnancy (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.71; 1 RCT, n = 5216; high-certainty evidence), resulting in 21 fewer women per 1000 becoming pregnant (from 27 to 13 fewer). DMPA compared to copper IUD results in a reduction in discontinuation of method (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.62; 1 RCT, n = 5216; high-certainty evidence) and in adverse events (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.75; 1 RCT, n = 5216; high-certainty evidence).

10.1093/jleuko/qiaf082,Caging Giants: Characterizing the molecular mechanisms of neutrophil swarming against Candida albicans hyphae.,"Neutrophils utilize many mechanisms to restrict fungal growth. When phagocytosis occurs, neutrophils can create many toxic antimicrobials including reactive oxygen species and the products of myeloperoxidase (MPO). If a pathogen is too large to phagocytose, neutrophils can also resort to the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) or it can engage in the behavior of ""swarming"", where the recruitment and antimicrobial action of many neutrophils are coordinated against a single target. Here we optimized an assay to study the behavior of swarming directly against live C. albicans hyphae. We find that hyphae are highly potent targets for inducing swarming behavior and that swarming is very effective at restricting hyphal growth. We provide insight into the initial interactions between the pioneer neutrophil and the hyphae, including information on how fast signaling is initiated following neutrophil binding, how far neutrophils stretch before signaling occurs, and how the calcium signaling waves are unique in response to hyphal targets. We also find distinct and important roles for MPO, spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), Bruton's tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and CD18 in an effective neutrophil swarming response.","Neutrophils utilize many mechanisms to restrict fungal growth.

10.1039/d5bm00612k,A collagen hydrogel-based intestinal model enabling physiological epithelial-immune cell interactions in host-microbe studies.,"The human intestine orchestrates complex immune responses to external stimuli, including trillions of gut microbes. Understanding host-microbiota interactions remains challenging due to the complex cellular composition of intestinal tissues. In this study, we present InTRIC (Intestinal model with Tissue-Resident Immune Components), a three-dimensional intestinal model incorporating tissue-resident immune cells within a biomimetic extracellular matrix. We developed a hydrogel system by combining UV-crosslinked methacrylated collagen with a native collagen blend that prevents matrix shrinkage while maintaining physiologically relevant mechanical properties, a fibrillar microstructure and minimal toxicity for cell embedding. Prior to establishing InTRIC, we validated THP-1 viability in the collagen hydrogel (>14 days), verified their differentiation into distinct macrophage phenotypes, and confirmed appropriate gene expression in Caco-2 cells on the collagen substrates. The integrated model comprises THP-1 macrophages embedded within the collagen matrix and Caco-2 cells forming a functional epithelium with intact junctions and physiologically relevant TEER values. The InTRIC platform enables both the assessment of cytokine profiles and the visualization of transepithelial macrophage infiltration in response to commensal (<i>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</i>) and pathogenic (<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>) bacteria. Notably, <i>P. aeruginosa</i> exposure induced a four-fold increase in macrophage infiltration and elevated IL-8 secretion. Compared to conventional cocultures without collagen, InTRIC exhibited attenuated inflammatory cytokine secretion, suggesting microenvironmental modulation of epithelial-immune communication. Additionally, M2-polarized macrophages showed reduced basal IL-8 secretion but increased responsiveness to bacterial stimulation. This proof-of-concept model demonstrates the importance of incorporating both immune cells and appropriate extracellular matrices in recapitulating intestinal conditions and offers a physiologically relevant test platform for applications in drug discovery, toxicology, and microbiome research.","The human intestine orchestrates complex immune responses to external stimuli, including trillions of gut microbes.

However, commercially available inactivated rabies vaccines often require multiple doses and lack potent adjuvants to enhance their efficacy. This study aimed to investigate the coupling of whole inactivated rabies virus to mannan under oxidizing conditions to improve immune responses against a standard rabies vaccine. We explored the conjugation of whole inactivated rabies virus with oxidized mannan (Rab-OxMan) to enhance immune responses. Mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 350 µg of the Rab-OxMan formulation on days 1 and 7. Two weeks after immunization, serum samples were collected to measure levels of IgG, IgM, and TNF-α using ELISA. The vaccine's potency was also evaluated using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) assay. Our findings showed a significant increase in IgG levels and a decrease in IgM levels in the Rab-OxMan group compared to the Alum-adjuvanted vaccine group (p<0.05). Additionally, TNF-α levels were notably higher in the Rab-OxMan group (p<0.05). Statistical analysis revealed that IgG levels had the highest sensitivity and specificity, with a significant correlation between the measured variables. Importantly, the Rab-OxMan formulation provided 1.8 times greater protection in challenge tests compared to the alum-adjuvanted group. This study is the first to demonstrate that oxidized mannan can serve as a novel adjuvant for veterinary rabies vaccines. The results highlight significant improvements in the immunogenicity and efficacy of rabies vaccines, suggesting a promising strategy for enhancing rabies prevention and potentially reducing the incidence of this deadly disease.","Rabies continues to pose a serious public health threat worldwide, with vaccination being the most effective means of prevention.

In the present study, we obtained a <i>G. duodenalis</i> isolate from a pet ferret and cultured it <i>in vitro</i>. The morphological character was consistent with <i>G. duodenalis</i>, being inverted pear-shaped with four pairs of flagella. The trophozoites measured 15.0 ± 1.2 μm (<i>n</i> = 50) in length and 7.5 ± 0.8 μm (<i>n</i> = 50) in width. The genome of the new isolate was 12.1 Mbp, which was relatively larger with a high guanine-cytosine (GC) content compared to <i>G. duodenalis</i> isolates from other hosts. 720 variant genes were identified, suggesting that the isolate might have evolved unique genetic features, potentially reflecting differences in its adaptive or pathogenic capabilities. The pathogenicity experiments revealed that the infection caused significant duodenal lesions, characterized by villous atrophy and breakage. Additionally, varying degrees of pathological changes were observed in other intestinal segments, and the infected animals exhibited a reduced rate of weight gain compared to the control group. In addition, molecular identification showed that the isolate belonged to zoonotic assemblage A at all three loci (<i>tpi</i>, <i>bg</i>, and <i>gdh</i>).

10.1093/ofid/ofaf302,Simplified and Integrated Hepatitis C Virus Testing and Treatment Algorithm for Unhoused People Who Inject Drugs.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection disproportionately affects people who inject drugs (PWID), particularly people experiencing homelessness, who face significant barriers to testing and treatment. Simplified testing and treatment algorithms, including the use of mobile medical units (MMUs), may improve access to care for this population. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a simplified HCV testing and treatment algorithm with integrated care delivered via MMU to unhoused PWID in an urban United States setting. This pragmatic, randomized controlled trial compared a simplified MMU care model with usual care among 201 PWID who tested positive for HCV antibody. Patients were randomized into simplified MMU or usual care. The primary outcome was treatment initiation within 6 months. Secondary outcomes included treatment completion, sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12), and initiation of medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. Of 98 patients with confirmed HCV RNA, 33% in the MMU group initiated treatment compared to 24% in the usual care group (<i>P</i> = .4). Treatment completion and SVR12 rates were higher in the usual care group (16% vs 10% and 12% vs 4%, respectively), but differences were not statistically significant. MMUs facilitated faster treatment initiation but encountered challenges with patient retention and follow-up. While the MMU model demonstrated potential for improving rapid access to HCV treatment, overall treatment initiation, retention, and cure rates remained low. A critical need remains to develop approaches that more closely approximate a test-and-treat model to increase treatment initiation and completion and achieve elimination in unhoused PWID.

While these tests offer high sensitivity, persistent <i>Pf</i>HRP2 antigenemia and gene deletions can cause false-positive and false-negative results, compromising their accuracy for malaria case management and surveillance. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance and antigen persistence of <i>Pf</i>HRP2-mRDTs using data from a longitudinal birth cohort of 750 children followed monthly from birth to 36 months in a holoendemic region of Kenya. Malaria diagnosis was performed using both microscopy and mRDTs, with a total of 15,006 clinical events recorded from 573 children between 2017 and 2023. Data from an independent acute febrile cohort of 937 children (<5 years) followed for 14 days was analyzed to validate the findings. The mRDT showed a high sensitivity of 97.27% but a moderate specificity of 65.00% in acute febrile illness, indicating frequent false-positive results. The positive predictive value was low (35.10%), suggesting that confirmatory testing is needed, while the negative predictive value was high (98.89%), reinforcing the reliability of mRDTs in ruling out malaria. Persistent <i>Pf</i>HRP2 antigenemia was observed, with a median antigen clearance time of 51.14 days, respectively. Higher initial parasite densities (>50,000/μL) were associated with a slower antigen decay rate (<i>p</i> = 0.001), highlighting the challenge of interpreting positive mRDT results after treatment. Validation using the acute febrile cohort showed that mRDT specificity exceeded 95% at initial diagnosis and follow-up. Overall, <i>Pf</i>HRP2-based mRDTs remain valuable for frontline malaria diagnosis but are limited by antigen persistence, leading to false positives in follow-up testing. Where feasible, integration of confirmatory diagnostic methods, such as microscopy or molecular assays, could improve the performance of malaria case management and clinical decision making, particularly in high-transmission settings.","Malaria remains a significant cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, with <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> Histidine-Rich Protein 2 (<i>Pf</i>HRP2)-based malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs) widely used in endemic regions where microscopy is sometimes not feasible.

While appropriate antimicrobial therapy offers undeniable benefits, its inappropriate or excessive use can lead to harmful side effects. This study examines the impact of an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) in the ICU on both diagnostic accuracy and antimicrobial consumption in critically ill patients with pneumonia. This cohort study compares a prospective cohort with matched controls from a retrospective sample in the ICU of a tertiary hospital. An ASP was implemented focusing on microbiological sampling of bacteria and antimicrobial therapy. Primary endpoint was days of therapy (DOTs). Secondary endpoints were number of respiratory samples (RS), identification of relevant bacteria in RS and diagnostic accuracy of pneumonia. Clinical safety outcome parameters were length of stay, length of invasive mechanical ventilation and ICU mortality until day 28. A total of 200 patients were assigned to the intervention group (IG) and 200 to the control group (CG). The overall DOTs per patient were 12.95 [95% confidence interval (CI) 11.42 to 14.47] in the CG compared to 9.91 (CI 8.97 to 10.82) in the IG (<i>p</i> = 0.036), with no unfavorable findings in safety outcome parameters.

The hydrogel has good injectability, adhesion, and self-healing capabilities, and can be well matched to irregular wounds and against external injuries. The loaded PUE is rapidly released from the hydrogel in response to near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, which has a controlled release property. In addition, under NIR laser irradiation, the hydrogel with good photothermal properties exerted good antimicrobial properties through localized high temperature, and exhibited good antioxidant, immune microenvironment modulation, and pro-angiogenic effects through accelerated released PUE. In the E. coli-infected full-thickness skin wounds healing experiments, the hydrogel can effectively kill bacteria, regulate the immune microenvironment, promote collagen deposition and angiogenesis, and significantly accelerate the wound healing, showing promising applications.","Wound infection is a serious clinical challenge, often accompanied by persistent inflammatory response and the threat of increased bacterial resistance, there is an urgent requirement to develop a wound dressing with potent antimicrobial as well as immunomodulatory effects.

However, there is limited information on the analytical performance, consistency, and quality of the methods used. Standardized and rigorous assays are needed to meet clinical study endpoints and for comparisons across studies. We optimized high-throughput multiplex immunoassays for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgA in HBM and determined antibody levels in HBM samples from 236 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated (infected and non-infected) and 50 pre-pandemic (unexposed) lactating women. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity was examined in a subset of 75 SARS-CoV-2 HBM from vaccinated (infected and non-infected) women using live virus focus reduction neutralization and pseudovirus assays. Concordance between SARS-CoV-2 binding and live virus neutralization outcomes was examined. The multiplex SARS-CoV-2 assays had adequate analytical sensitivity, repeatability, precision, and assay linearity and were reliable for quantification of IgG and IgA in HBM. Positivity thresholds for Spike- and Nucleocapsid-specific IgG and IgA were established; IgG discriminated positive/negative SARS-CoV-2-immune HBM with high sensitivity and specificity, while IgA reactivity overlapped. A strong correlation was observed between live SARS-CoV-2 and pseudovirus neutralization activity. HBM Spike IgA and neutralization titers were highly correlated.

Abnormal mechanical stress can induce chondrocytes ferroptosis, thereby accelerating the progression of osteoarthritis. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of targeting chondrocyte ferroptosis to delay the progression of osteoarthritis and identified a potential therapeutic target. Through transcriptomic sequencing analysis, we identified a potential association between thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) and mechanical stress-induced chondrocyte ferroptosis. In this study we used via adeno-associated virus-mediated THBS1 overexpression, cell pressurization model and GPX4-conditional knockout (Col2a1-CreERT: GPX4<sup>flox/flox</sup>) mice to verify the regulatory effect of THBS1 on chondrocytes ferroptosis. Additionally, protein interaction network analysis, immunofluorescence co-localization, and co-immunoprecipitation were conducted to investigate the mechanism by which THBS1 modulates chondrocytes ferroptosis. The expression of THBS1 protein was reduced in load-bearing cartilage tissue in humans. THBS1 suppressed chondrocytes ferroptosis induced by excessive mechanical stress. Immunofluorescence co-localization and CO-IP experiments indicated that integrin αV/β1 serves as the membrane receptor through which THBS1 regulates chondrocyte ferroptosis under mechanical stress. Upon activation, integrin αV/β1 modulated YAP1 nuclear translocation, thereby affecting GPX4 activity. Intra-articular injection of THBS1 synthetic peptides effectively reduced cartilage damage in mouse OA models, protecting articular cartilage and slowing the progression of osteoarthritis. Our results indicate THBS1 regulates mechanical stress-induced chondrocyte ferroptosis through the Integrin/YAP pathway. Furthermore, THBS1 effectively slows the progression of osteoarthritis and protects articular cartilage.","Osteoarthritis in weight-bearing joints significantly impacts the quality of life in middle-aged and elderly individuals. Abnormal mechanical stress can induce chondrocytes ferroptosis, thereby accelerating the progression of osteoarthritis. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of targeting chondrocyte ferroptosis to delay the progression of osteoarthritis and identified a potential therapeutic target. Through transcriptomic sequencing analysis, we identified a potential association between thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) and mechanical stress-induced chondrocyte ferroptosis. In this study we used via adeno-associated virus-mediated THBS1 overexpression, cell pressurization model and GPX4-conditional knockout (Col2a1-CreERT: GPX4<sup>flox/flox</sup>) mice to verify the regulatory effect of THBS1 on chondrocytes ferroptosis. Additionally, protein interaction network analysis, immunofluorescence co-localization, and co-immunoprecipitation were conducted to investigate the mechanism by which THBS1 modulates chondrocytes ferroptosis. The expression of THBS1 protein was reduced in load-bearing cartilage tissue in humans. THBS1 suppressed chondrocytes ferroptosis induced by excessive mechanical stress. Immunofluorescence co-localization and CO-IP experiments indicated that integrin αV/β1 serves as the membrane receptor through which THBS1 regulates chondrocyte ferroptosis under mechanical stress. Upon activation, integrin αV/β1 modulated YAP1 nuclear translocation, thereby affecting GPX4 activity. Intra-articular injection of THBS1 synthetic peptides effectively reduced cartilage damage in mouse OA models, protecting articular cartilage and slowing the progression of osteoarthritis.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are relatively less toxic and can be easily administered to vulnerable and aged patients suffering from cancer. The diversity of gut microbiota and specific bacteria affects the efficacy and safety of ICIs. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effect of aging on gut microbiota that play crucial roles in determining antitumor efficacy of drugs. Stool samples were collected from 36 aged patients pathologically diagnosed with solid tumors before the start of drug therapy, and gut microbial composition was analyzed using next generation sequencing. The association between gut microbiota and efficacy and safety of ICIs was analyzed. The abundance of <i>Veillonella</i> species significantly decreased in patients aged ≥75 years. Additionally, the gut microbiota in the responder group was significantly higher than that in the non-responder group regardless of age. The abundance of <i>Streptococcus</i> species was significantly higher in the responder group than that in the non-responder group. These gut microbiota changes with aging, and its characteristics are important parameters that also affect the efficacy of ICIs.","The rapid increase in the number of elderly patients with cancer necessitates treatment strategies based on the effects of aging because of drastic side effects of cytotoxic anticancer agents.

However, cannabinoid use continues to increase in the US general population for recreational purposes as well as in cancer patients for palliative care. In this study, we explored the role of cannabidiol (CBD) in promoting anti-tumor activity by modulating immune response in HPV-positive HNSCC by using pre-clinical models. The anti-proliferative effect of CBD on HPV-positive HNSCC cells was evaluated through BrdU, apoptosis and migration analyses, followed by western blot analysis to assess its role in activating the MAPK pathway. Next, the anti-tumor immune response of CBD was evaluated in immunocompetent syngeneic mouse as well as in immune-deficient B6.129S7-Rag1<sup>tm1Mom</sup>/J or Rag 1 Knockout mice (Rag1 -/-) and athymic nude mouse. Immune cell infiltration was measured by flow cytometry, IHC and multiplex IHC analysis after subcutaneous injection of mEER cells. Furthermore, the anti-tumor activity of CBD on the tumor microenvironment was evaluated after the depletion of CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells in murine models. We observed CBD treatment inhibited cell proliferation and migration by promoting apoptosis in HPV-positive HNSCC cells through activation of the MAPK pathway and its associated markers like ERK1/2, JNK/SAPK and MK2. CBD significantly inhibited tumor growth in immunocompetent mice but had no effect in immune-deficient models, indicating an immune-dependent mechanism. CBD enhanced infiltration of CD4+T and CD8+T cells, CD19+B cells, NK cells, and M1-like macrophages into the primary tumors of immunocompetent syngeneic mice models, implicating an enhanced anti-tumor immune response. Interestingly, we observed a significant increase in tumor volume in CD4-depleted mice treated with CBD as compared to CBD-treated wild-type mice suggesting the importance of CD4+T cells in CBD-mediated anti-tumor activity. Finally, multiplex IHC analysis demonstrated co-localization of CD4+T and CD8+ T cells with the activated MAPK marker phospho-p38 in CBD-treated tumors. CBD inhibits tumor cell proliferation in HPV-positive HNSCC by activating the MAPK pathway. It also enhances anti-tumor activity by modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, promoting co-localization of p38 MAPK-activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.","Marijuana use is associated with HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

In this study, we analyzed responses of CD8-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells from chronic progressors (CPs) on suppressive antiretroviral therapy to ARFP peptide pools derived from HIV Gag, polymerase (Pol), and envelope (Env) proteins. Memory CD4+ T cell responses were detected to Gag ARFP peptide pools in 7 out of 13 CPs and to Env ARFP peptide pools in 2 out of 13 CPs. Individual peptide stimulation identified immunogenic peptides that were predicted to bind to major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) proteins. HIV RNA was detected in culture supernatants from 3 of 6 CPs following stimulation of CD4+ T cells with ARFP peptide pools. These findings demonstrate that ARFP-derived peptides elicit antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses and may contribute to latency reversal. Our data expand the known HIV immunopeptidome and suggest that ARFPs may serve as potential targets for immune-based interventions.","HIV-1 alternative reading frame proteins (ARFPs) have been shown to elicit CD8+ T cell responses, but less is known about the recognition of these proteins by CD4+ T cells.

In related work, there has been interest in inferring (in real-time) when outbreaks have ended and control interventions can be relaxed. Here, we analyse data from the 2018 Ebola outbreak in Équateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, during which an Ebola Response Team (ERT) was deployed to implement public health measures. We use a renewal equation transmission model to perform a <i>quasi</i> real-time investigation into when the ERT could be withdrawn safely at the tail end of the outbreak. Specifically, each week following the arrival of the ERT, we calculate the probability of future cases if the ERT is withdrawn. First, we show that similar estimates of the probability of future cases can be obtained from either daily or weekly case reports. This demonstrates that high temporal resolution case reporting may not always be necessary to determine when interventions can be relaxed. Second, we demonstrate how case under-reporting can be accounted for rigorously when estimating the probability of future cases. We find that, the lower the level of case reporting, the longer it is necessary to wait after the apparent final case before interventions can be removed safely (with only a small probability of additional cases). Finally, we show how uncertainty in the extent of case reporting can be included in estimates of the probability of future cases. Our research highlights the importance of accounting for under-reporting in deciding when to remove interventions at the tail ends of infectious disease outbreaks.","Professor Pierre Magal made important contributions to the field of mathematical biology before his death on February 20, 2024, including research in which epidemiological models were used to study the ends of infectious disease outbreaks.

10.1101/2025.05.16.654520,Mutation rate variability in viral populations: implications for lethal mutagenesis.,"Lethal mutagenesis is a strategy to achieve viral extinction by drugging viral mutation rates beyond an extinction threshold. Accurate estimation of the extinction threshold is critical, as elevating viral mutation rates near, but not past this threshold increases the likelihood of mutations that could result in drug resistance, vaccine escape, or increased pathogenesis. Traditional models of lethal mutagenesis rely on the Poisson distribution, which assumes a uniform mutation rate across individuals. Yet, RNA viruses like influenza A virus (IAV) can have varied mutation rates due to mutations in the polymerase complex. This variability suggests that lethal mutagenesis models incorporating mutation rate diversity, such as ones using the gamma-Poisson distribution, may be more accurate for RNA viruses. Poisson models assume count data have equal mean and variance, while gamma-Poisson counts are overdispersed (variance greater than mean). Here we provide experimental data showing that IAV mutations are overdispersed, indicating that the gamma-Poisson distribution is more appropriate for modeling IAV mutations. Modeling of lethal mutagenesis using the gamma-Poisson distribution reveals that the degree of overdispersion is critical in determining survival or extinction. Increased overdispersion shifts the extinction threshold higher, indicating that Poisson-based models have underestimated the mutation rate required to achieve viral extinction and avoid viral escape or accelerated evolution. Furthermore, time to extinction in simulated populations is significantly longer with gamma-Poisson-based models than Poisson-based. This investigation of how mutation rate variability affects lethal mutagenesis will directly impact antiviral drug design and strategy, thus advancing efforts to combat virus outbreaks and future pandemics. RNA viruses mutate at high rates. Some antiviral drugs work by further increasing these rates to unsustainable levels, a process called lethal mutagenesis. In this work, we discover that mutation rates vary significantly throughout viral populations. This discovery changes our understanding of how mutations and mutation rates should be modeled. By considering variability in mutation rates, our new model reveals that lethal mutagenesis is less effective as an antiviral drug strategy than previously thought.","Lethal mutagenesis is a strategy to achieve viral extinction by drugging viral mutation rates beyond an extinction threshold.

10.1101/2025.05.19.654958,Temperature and genetic background drive mobilization of diverse transposable elements in a critical human fungal pathogen.,"Transposable elements (TEs) are key agents of genome evolution across all domains of life. These mobile genetic elements can cause mutations through transposition or by promoting structural rearrangements. Stress conditions can amplify TE activity, either by impairing TE suppression mechanisms or through stress-induced interactions between transcription factors and TE sequences, offering a route for rapid genetic change. As such, TEs represent an important source of adaptability within populations. To investigate the interplay between environmental stress and eukaryotic TE dynamics relevant to infectious disease, we examined how heat stress and nutrient limitation affect TE mobility in the human fungal pathogen <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> , using a collection of clinical and environmental isolates. Seven distinct mobile element families, encompassing diverse retrotransposons and DNA transposons, were captured mobilizing to confer antifungal resistance, including a novel element, CNEST, which belongs to the CACTA, Mirage, Chapaev (CMC) supergroup. Heat stress at human body temperature (37°C) significantly increased the mobilization of a subset of these TEs, leading to higher rates of acquired antifungal resistance. Whole-genome assemblies revealed that, compared to retrotransposons, DNA transposons were hypomethylated and approximately uniformly distributed throughout the genome, features that may contribute to their frequent mobilization. We further assessed TE-driven genomic changes within hosts using serial isolates from patients with recurrent cryptococcal infections and from isolates passaged through mice. While we observed evidence of TE copy number changes near chromosome ends, we found no indication of TE-mediated alterations near gene-coding regions across any of the serial isolates. Finally, TE mobility was isolate- and strain-dependent, with significant variation even among clonally related isolates collected from the same patient, emphasizing the role of genetic background in shaping TE activity. Together, these findings reveal a complex, dynamic relationship between environmental stress, genetic background, and TE mobility, with important implications for adaptation and acquired antifungal resistance in <i>C. neoformans</i> .","Transposable elements (TEs) are key agents of genome evolution across all domains of life.

One understudied characteristic of T4P includes the spatial organization of T4P envelope-spanning nanomachines and how organizational patterns contribute to single cell behaviors. The bacterial species <i>Acinetobacter baylyi</i> localizes its T4P nanomachines in a unique pattern along the long axis of the cell, making it a robust model to study the mechanisms underlying the regulation of intracellular organization in single cell organisms. In this work, we find that the T4P regulatory protein FimX has been co-opted away from regulating T4P dynamics to instead control T4P positioning through a chemosensory Pil-Chp pathway.

Epistasis shapes this evolution, as an antigenic mutation that is deleterious in one genetic background may become tolerated in another. However, the extent to which epistasis can alleviate pleiotropic conflicts between immune escape and protein function/stability is unclear. Here, we measure how all amino acid mutations in the HA of a recent human H3N2 influenza strain affect its cell entry function, acid stability, and neutralization by human serum antibodies. We find that epistasis has enabled emergence of antigenic mutations that were detrimental to HA's cell entry function in earlier strains. However, epistasis appears insufficient to overcome the pleiotropic costs of antigenic mutations that impair HA's stability, explaining why some mutations that strongly escape human antibodies never fix in nature. Our results refine our understanding of the mutational constraints that shape influenza evolution: epistasis can enable antigenic change, but pleiotropic effects can restrict its trajectory.","The evolution of human influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) involves simultaneous selection to acquire antigenic mutations that escape population immunity while preserving protein function and stability.

To address this challenge, here we employed a multi-omics approach to identify protein interactors that enhance the secretion of sE1E2. By detecting Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) using Biotinylation by Antibody Recognition (BAR) and integrating the data with RNA-Seq, we identified proteins within the secretory pathway that interact with sE1E2 and validated their impact by overexpressing the interacting proteins. Among these, CUL4A and YWHAH enhanced sE1E2 secretion in glycoengineered CHO (geCHO) cells. The integration of omics techniques and genetic engineering in this study provides valuable insights into improving protein secretion in CHO cells, paving the way for the development of more affordable and accessible biotherapeutics.","Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is a bloodborne virus that affects 57 million people globally with infections that can often go unnoticed, and it is the leading cause of chronic liver disease and cancer. Thus, development of an HCV vaccine is a major medical and public health concern.

10.1101/2025.05.19.654939,Temperature-dependent modulation of aberrant influenza A virus RNA synthesis affects innate immune signaling.,"Fever during influenza A virus (IAV) infection is triggered by the innate immune response. Various factors contribute to this response, including IAV mini viral RNAs (mvRNA), which trigger RIG-I signaling when their replication and transcription are dysregulated by template loops (t-loop). While fever is a symptom of the infection, it also alters the environment in which virus replicates. This changing environment may impact the viral infection cycle and in turn disease outcome. Here we show that IAV infection at temperatures that simulate fever leads to increased mvRNA synthesis and antiviral signaling. Mathematical modeling and experimental analyses reveal that differential IAV nucleoprotein and RNA polymerase production underlies the increased mvRNA level. Moreover, at the higher infection temperature mvRNAs with dysregulating t-loops contribute most to the innate immune activation. We propose that fever-enhanced mvRNA production is a self-amplifying feedback loop that may affect infection outcome.","Fever during influenza A virus (IAV) infection is triggered by the innate immune response.

Treatment of EWS has progressed relatively little in over 30 years. Survival rates for patients, particularly those with metastatic and/or relapsed disease, remain poor, highlighting the urgent need for innovative treatment options. We have explored the therapeutic potential of the oncolytic Maraba virus strain MG1. We show that MG1 undergoes productive replication and exerts direct oncolysis of established EWS cell lines, doxorubicin-resistant EWS cell lines and patient-derived Ewing sarcoma (PDES) cell cultures more recently established from tumours. In contrast, primary mesenchymal stem cells (the likely cell of origin of EWS) were resistant to MG1, with IFN-I being a major determinant of tumour cell selectivity. MG1 treated PBMC produced IFN-I and killed EWS cells <i>in vitro,</i> in a natural killer (NK) cell-dependent manner. The ability of MG1 to kill EWS cells directly and to stimulate NK cell cytotoxicity against this tumour suggests that Maraba virus MG1 may provide therapeutic benefit for EWS patients where the efficacy of conventional treatments is currently limited.","Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is a rare cancer of the bone and soft tissue, most prevalent in children and young adults.

While the canonical function of BMI-1 involves epigenetic repression, novel extra-nuclear functions have been recently reported. In the present study, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation of BMI-1 in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) cells occurs in M phase and that triggers simultaneous translocation of the phosphorylated BMI-1 to the cytoplasm. This translocation is mediated by the RanGTP-dependent transporter CRM1, also known as exportin. Furthermore, we uncovered a previously unidentified nuclear export signal (NES) in BMI-1 protein, suggesting an active transport type of modified BMI-1 mediated by CRM1. These findings associate BMI-1 phosphorylation with its trafficking in M phase. Collectively, this study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying BMI-1 functions in DIPG, thereby potentially paving the way for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies related to M phase progression.","BMI-1 (B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1) has been implicated in both normal and cancer cell biology.

Taking advantage of the sexual lifecycle of this eukaryotic pathogen, we use genetic crosses to discover the underlying chromosomal loci. Whole-genome sequencing and bulk segregant analysis of infection selected progeny mapped three loci on chromosomes 2, 6, and 7 associated with the ability to colonize and persist in mice and the positions of drug resistance genes. The chromosome 6 locus encodes the hyper-polymorphic surface glycoprotein GP60. Reverse genetic studies in both parental strains demonstrate that GP60 controls parasite burden and virulence, but not persistence, and reveal the dominance of the less virulent allele, suggesting it restricts virulence.","The relationship between parasite genotype and pathogenesis is largely unknown for <i>Cryptosporidium</i> , a leading cause of diarrheal disease in children.

Here, we report that coordination of HIV-1 assembly by the viral polyprotein Gag suppresses inappropriately-timed protease (PR) activity to evade the PR activity sensor, CARD8. Employing mutants of Gag, we show that disruption of domains controlling viral assembly site (MA) or virus particle release (NC and p6) lead to premature activation of PR and the CARD8 inflammasome, resulting in IL-1β secretion and pyroptotic cell death. Further, we demonstrate that previously-observed host-adaptive mutations in HIV-1 MA (M30K) and p6 (PTAP duplication) associated with greater fitness in humans differentially modulate the process of viral assembly and budding to evade CARD8-mediated cell death. Altogether, this work reveals adaptation to human CARD8 by HIV-1 Gag upon zoonotic transmission from chimpanzees and suggests that assembly-regulated CARD8 activation influences the trajectory of HIV-1 evolution and fitness in humans.","As intracellular parasites, viruses must devise sophisticated mechanisms to produce and assemble viral components while suppressing activation of innate immune effectors.

By integrating single-cell RNA sequencing with immunohistochemistry, <i>in situ</i> hybridization, and advanced imaging techniques, distinct SGC subclusters were identified, validated, and spatially mapped within their native anatomical context. We visually identify four distinct subpopulations: 1) a predominant population of perisomatic SGC sheaths defined by the expression of marker proteins traditionally used to characterize the entire SGC population, including FABP7, KIR4.1, GS, and CX43. 2) OCT6+ SGCs occasionally being found in mosaic perisomatic sheaths, and consistently associated with axonal glomeruli, primarily ensheathing initial segment axon. 3) SCN7A+ SGCs, exhibiting no/low expression of traditional SGC markers and forming specialized homogenous sheaths around non-peptidergic neuron subtypes, implicating their potential role in pruritic (itch-related) conditions. 4) Interferon response gene-expressing SGCs, responding to Herpes Simplex Virus infection, suggesting potential involvement in antiviral protection.

The pandemic GII.4 Sydney 2012 strain enters cells via membrane wounding and clathrin-independent carrier (CLIC)-mediated endocytosis, but it is unclear whether this entry mechanism is conserved across GII.4 variants. We compared early binding and entry of multiple GII.4 variants using wildtype and mutant GII.4 virus-like particles (VLPs) and modified human intestinal enteroid (HIE) cultures. Only a subset of GII.4 variants, including GII.4 Sydney, form distinct, HBGA-dependent capsid clusters on the cell surface. Clustering strains display significantly enhanced membrane wounding and endocytosis compared to non-clustering strains and outcompete non-clustering strains in replication assays as shown by complete inhibition of GII.4 Sydney replication. Using mutant VLPs and a HBGA non-binding mutant (R345A), we identified two residues, V333 and R339, in the VP1 protruding domain as critical mediators of clustering and entry. Mutations of these residues disrupt clustering and endocytosis without affecting HBGA binding, suggesting a role in post-attachment processes. While clustering and endocytosis are contingent upon VLP binding to HBGAs, inhibitor studies show they are independent of host protein glycosylation and are driven by lipid raft remodeling regulated by cholesterol and ceramides. Quantitative analyses across multiple GII.4 variants reveal an apparent dichotomy between clustering and non-clustering phenotypes, with clustering variants exhibiting higher entry competence. This distinction offers insight into strain-specific cell entry mechanisms and may aid in identifying the elusive proteinaceous HuNoV cellular receptor(s) supporting targeted therapeutic development.","Human noroviruses (HuNoVs), especially GII.4 strains, are the leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis worldwide, yet no approved vaccines or antivirals exist.

HIV latency is maintained through chromatin-mediated repression, making epigenetic regulators attractive therapeutic targets. To identify new modulators of latency, we screened a focused library of 84 chromatin-targeting small molecules. This screen identified BAY-299, a bromodomain inhibitor selective for TAF1 and BRD1, as a latency-modulating compound. BAY-299 reactivated HIV expression and enhanced the efficacy of established latency-reversing agents (LRAs), including vorinostat, prostratin, and iBET-151, in cell line models. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout experiments demonstrated that TAF1, but not BRD1, is essential for maintaining HIV latency and that TAF1 depletion selectively increases HIV transcription with minimal effects on host gene expression. Dual knockout of TAF1 and Tat revealed that the reactivation effect is partially Tat dependent. CUT&RUN analysis further showed that TAF1 depletion increases RNA Polymerase II occupancy across the HIV gene body, suggesting enhanced transcriptional elongation. These findings identify TAF1 as a novel regulator of HIV latency and demonstrate the utility of targeted chemical screening to uncover therapeutic vulnerabilities within the latent reservoir. HIV remains incurable due to the persistence of a transcriptionally silent reservoir in infected cells that is not eliminated by antiretroviral therapy. This transcriptionally silent state, known as latency, is controlled by host cell factors that regulate access to the viral genome. In this study, we identified the host protein TAF1 as a key regulator that maintains HIV in a latent state. Using both genetic and chemical approaches, we demonstrated that reducing TAF1 levels selectively increases HIV gene expression without broadly disrupting host gene transcription. These findings highlight a previously unrecognized mechanism of HIV latency control and identify TAF1 as a potential therapeutic target. Understanding how host chromatin regulators contribute to latency is essential for developing strategies that aim to eliminate the persistent HIV reservoir.","Antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV replication but fails to eliminate the virus due to the persistence of a transcriptionally silent reservoir, which remains the primary barrier to a cure.

Electron and immunofluorescence microscopy and virology assays showed that ΔE SARS-CoV-2 increased cell surface expression of Spike (S) glycoprotein, leading to reduced S incorporation into ΔE SARS-CoV-2 particles and promotion of increased cell-to-cell transmission that evades neutralizing antibody inhibition. Trans-complementation of E partially rescued ΔE SARS-CoV-2 S incorporation and restored cell-free transmission. In addition to validating the role of E in retention of S in the ER-Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC), our results showed that a lack of E led to reorganization of the ERGIC during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Improved understanding of E in SARS-CoV-2 replication and host pathogenesis may help development of novel therapeutics. Non-S coronavirus structural proteins, including E, are conserved, making them potential pan-coronavirus therapeutic targets. Many details about these proteins and their roles in viral replication and host pathogenesis are unknown. In this study, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 replicates without E but is attenuated and impaired for virus particle formation, with less S incorporated into virions and more S expressed on the cell surface compared to wild-type virus. SARS-CoV-2 lacking E spread primarily via cell fusion and evaded neutralizing antibodies. In addition, the absence of E resulted in the reorganization of the ERGIC cell secretory compartment during SARS-CoV-2 infection. A better understanding of how E influences SARS-CoV-2 replication could guide directed design of novel therapeutics for treatment of COVID-19 patients, as well as the potential for pan-coronavirus protection against future coronavirus outbreaks.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19, a highly transmissible acute respiratory infection that can result in severe pneumonia and death. Many details of SARS-CoV-2 infection are not fully understood, including the cell biology and host-virus interactions involved in coronavirus assembly and release, in which the Envelope (E) structural protein is instrumental. Deletion of E in other coronaviruses has been shown previously to either attenuate or abrogate infection.

10.1101/2025.05.20.654373,A conserved region T-cell vaccine for Sarbecoviruses.,"The rapid development of vaccines was a critical part of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 (a Sarbecovirus and member of the Betacoronavirus genus responsible for the pandemic) virus was first detected in Wuhan, China in late 2019. Effective mRNA vaccines based on the viral Spike protein were designed from the earliest isolates and available by December of 2020. SARS-CoV-2 has continued to evolve in the human population, accruing neutralizing antibody resistance mutations that have necessitated updating the vaccine periodically to better match contemporary variants. Neutralizing antibody cross-reactivity is generally very limited among the diverse members of the betacoronavirus genus that are of clinical importance in people. Here, we present an alternative vaccine strategy based on eliciting T-cell responses targeting four highly conserved regions shared across the betacoronavirus proteomes. We hypothesized that cross-reactive responses to these regions could temper disease severity. Focusing immune responses on highly conserved epitopes could be beneficial as SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, or if a novel betacoronavirus should enter the human population. Vaccination with these highly conserved regions induced robust T-cell responses in mice and rhesus macaques. Vaccinated hamsters were significantly protected against weight loss and lung inflammation after challenge with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. After a SARS-CoV-2 Delta challenge in rhesus macaques, 3 out of 4 animals in the control group had infectious virus in their bronchoalveolar lavage samples, while the 4 animals in the vaccinated group did not.","The rapid development of vaccines was a critical part of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

10.1101/2025.05.16.654476,THC Reverses SIV-Induced Senescence in Astrocytes: Possible Compensatory Mechanism Against HIV Associated Brain Injury?,"Despite effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), chronic neuroinflammation and glial dysfunction continues to be an important yet understudied issue with people living with HIV (PLWH). The endocannabinoid system is increasingly recognized as a potential therapeutic target for modulating neuroimmune environments, given its role in regulating synaptic plasticity, immune responses, and neuroinflammatory cascades. However, the extent to which cannabinoids influence HIV-associated neuroinflammation remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on astrocyte growth characteristics, viability, and senescence-associated cytokine release following exposure to HIV Tat protein using primary mixed glial cultures derived from rhesus macaques. Real-time impedance-based cellular integrity assessments were conducted using the xCELLigence system, while morphological analyses and cytokine quantification were performed using phase-contrast microscopy and multiplex immunoassays. Treatment of macaques with THC protected the astrocytes from virus-induced senescence. Further, THC facilitated a rapid recovery from Tat-induced decline in astrocyte adhesion, suggesting a compensatory effect. THC promoted glial process elongation and morphological complexity, indicative of a shift toward a neuroprotective phenotype. Furthermore, THC significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine secretion, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, in an apparently dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that THC may modulate neuroinflammation in PLWH by promoting astrocytic survival, suppressing inflammatory cytokine secretion, and enhancing neurotrophic signaling. However, prolonged exposure to high-dose THC may negatively impact glial survival. The results underscore the complexity of cannabinoid signaling in the CNS and highlight the potential of cannabinoid-based interventions to mitigate HIV-associated neuroinflammation.","Despite effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), chronic neuroinflammation and glial dysfunction continues to be an important yet understudied issue with people living with HIV (PLWH).

10.1101/2025.05.20.655185,Seizure Circuit Activity in the Theiler's Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus Model of Infection-induced Epilepsy Using Transient Recombination in Active Populations.,"Epilepsy affects one in twenty-six individuals. A major cause of epilepsy worldwide is viral encephalitis. Central nervous system infections can provoke seizures in the short term and increase the risk of spontaneous, recurrent seizures post-infection. However, the neural mechanisms underlying seizures during acute infection are unknown. These neuronal changes can be studied in C57BL6/J mice infected with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). TMEV-infected mice experience seizures 3-8 days post-injection (DPI), clear the virus by DPI 14, and may develop chronic, acquired temporal lobe epilepsy. TMEV may incite seizures during the acute infection period through inflammation, reactive gliosis, and cell death in hippocampal area CA1. Here, we explore the neuronal circuits underlying acute seizures in TMEV-injected mice using c-Fos driven TRAP (targeted recombination in active populations). TRAP mice (c-Fos- CreERT2 x CAG-tdTomato) were injected with PBS or TMEV and gently handled on DPI 5 to induce seizures. 4-OHT was administered to mice either 1.5 or 3 hr after seizures to tag the active cells expressing c-Fos with tdTomato. After 1 week, the mice were sacrificed and whole mouse brains were sectioned and immunostained for tdTomato expression. Percent area of fluorescence was quantified, and comparisons were made between TMEV-injected mice and PBS controls, sites ipsilateral vs contralateral to TMEV injection site, and between sexes. TdTomato expression was elevated in the TMEV-injected mice in the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus, thalamus, lateral septal nucleus, basal ganglia, triangular septal nucleus, fornix, and corpus callosum. Critically, the expression pattern suggests that seizures induced on DPI 5 arise from the hilus, dentate gyrus, and CA3 hippocampal subregions. Generalized seizures during acute TMEV infection may have propagated to the contralateral hemisphere via CA3 and the hippocampal commissure. TRAP has not been previously utilized in the TMEV mouse model and these experiments address crucial questions regarding seizure spread during TMEV infection.","Epilepsy affects one in twenty-six individuals.

10.3389/fmicb.2025.1603289,Microbial community shifts during salt mitigation treatments of historic buildings using mineral poultices: a long-term monitoring of salt and associated biofilms.,"Increased heavy rainfall followed by periods of drought due to climate change is leading to more frequent salt-crystallization cycles. This not only leads to increased salt-weathering on architectural surfaces of cultural heritage monuments, but also creates an ideal ecological niche for the formation of biofilms by salt-loving microorganisms. These biofilms, characterized by a distinctive pink coloration, cause additional esthetic alterations to affected surfaces. In this study, mineral poultices prepared with different clay minerals (sepiolite, kaolinite and vermiculite) were developed and tested for a long-term (1 year) application on salt-weathered surfaces, thus contributing to their preservation. The poultices were tested on the surfaces of two historic buildings: the St. Virgil's Chapel in Vienna and the Mauerbach Charterhouse in Lower Austria, both showing salt efflorescence and a uniform pink biofilm. First, the poultices were tested to evaluate their salt retention capacity, salt-weathering resistance and processability. The retention properties of the poultices were examined by measuring their salt content throughout the treatment using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and continuous flow analysis (CFA). Salt content was also measured on the wall surfaces before and after treatment. Second, the effect of the desalination treatments on salt-associated pink biofilms was also evaluated. The shifts within the biofilm communities during and after the treatment were monitored by qPCR and long-read archaeal- and bacterial-16S rRNA amplicon analysis using the Nanopore sequencing technology. The results demonstrate that both the selected clay minerals and the salt composition in the treated areas significantly influenced the salt storage capacity of the poultices and their resistance to salt weathering. Fluctuations in salt load and ionic composition during and after treatment affected biofilm composition, with bacterial communities proving more sensitive than archaea to these changes. Both qPCR and metataxonomic results show that the effects of the poultices on the colonizing biofilms depend not only on the composition of their microbial members, but also on external abiotic factors such as the chemical composition and concentration of the salt mixtures on the surfaces. In addition, the biodiversity within the biofilms shows to be affected differently depending on the mineral clay used.","Increased heavy rainfall followed by periods of drought due to climate change is leading to more frequent salt-crystallization cycles.

This study initially investigated the effects of adding fungi-static <i>C. iranensis</i> (ZJW-6) on lignocellulose, humic acid, and bacterial communities during the spring and autumn composting of rice straw in Northeast China. ZJW-6 is a cellulose degrading bacterium, which is used as the microorganism for composting inoculation. Four treatments are set up:spring composting with no bacteria added; spring composting with added bacteria, autumn composting without added bacteria, and autumn composting with added bacteria. The effects of adding microorganisms in spring and autumn composting on its physical and chemical properties and microbial community changes are explored. The results demonstrated that ZWJ-6 altered the bacterial community composition by increasing the relative abundance of lignocellulose-decomposing bacteria and the Actinobacteriota phylum in both spring and autumn composting. This enhancement strengthened the functional contributions of the bacterial community during composting. Specifically, the degradation efficiencies of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose in straw composting increased by 7.63%-14.71%, 22.45%-97.76%, and 28.48%-41.71%, respectively. Additionally, the content of humic acid and nitrogen increased by 12.44%-38.27% and 4.56%-5.81%, respectively. Autumn composting showed better decomposition and maturity. The addition of ZJW-6 promotes the maturation of both spring and autumn compost decomposition, offering a new agricultural solid waste disposal options for the straw-returning cultivation model in the region.

The variable regions of IgNAR (VNARs) are solely responsible for antigen recognition, similar to VHHs (variable domain of the heavy chain of heavy-chain antibodies) in camelids. Although VNARs have attracted growing interest, generating VNARs against membrane proteins remains challenging. Furthermore, the structure of a VNAR in complex with a membrane protein has not yet been reported. This study features a membrane protein, Chlorella virus hyaluronan synthase (CvHAS), and provides a comprehensive methodological approach to generate its specific shark VNARs, addressing several major concerns and important optimizations. We showed that shark physiological urea pressure was tolerable for CvHAS, and indirect immobilization was strongly preferred over passive adsorption for membrane proteins. Together with optimizations to improve mononuclear cell (MC) viability and VNAR expression efficiency, we successfully generated S2F6, a CvHAS-specific VNAR with nM-level high affinity. The structure of the CvHAS-S2F6 complex was then determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), reporting the first membrane protein and VNAR complex structure. It shows that S2F6 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of CvHAS, with a different epitope than the reported CvHAS-specific VHHs.

Pathogens such as staphylococci interact with fibrin through dynamic processes, involving binding, entrapment, and release from fibrin scaffolds, through which they experience an evolving cascade of nano- to microscale dynamics that span broad timescales. Yet, the biophysical dynamics that unfold between invading bacteria and host fibrin are not well understood. Here, we present a non-invasive optical approach based on speckle fluctuation to characterize the multiscale dynamics of microparticles in fibrin scaffolds. Using microparticles of varying sizes and surface chemistry to emulate spherical, non-motile bacterial cells, we demonstrate real-time monitoring of bacteria-fibrin interactions during fibrin clot formation and fibrinolysis in purified fibrins scaffolds and clinical plasma clots.

However, the processes and pathways leading to the formation of cyanobacterial blooms are largely stochastic, and a targeted quantitative model incorporating multiple drivers is required. A series of fieldwork and analytical procedures were conducted on 11 lakes in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and neighboring regions. The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of location, climate, habitat, metabolism and biology on the abundance of cyanobacteria. The findings indicated that location factors exerted an indirect influence on cyanobacterial density, with a calculated effect size of -0.001. This observation is consistent with the documented prevalence of cyanobacterial bloom outbreaks, suggesting that cyanobacterial abundance is not directly associated with location. Furthermore, the water environment (0.35 indirect and -0.37 direct effects) and climatic conditions (-0.2 indirect and 0.16 direct effects) had significant direct and indirect effects on cyanobacterial cell densities. It was also determined that high nutrients and high temperatures remained the basis for promoting cyanobacterial blooms. It is noteworthy that the microbial community exerted a substantial inhibitory effect on the proliferation of the cyanobacterial community (1.13 direct inhibitory effect). It is hypothesized that the negative effect is derived from two primary sources: the competition for ecological niches by organisms exhibiting similarity, and the direct inhibitory effect of certain bacteria on the growth of cyanobacteria, a negative correlation between acidobacteriota, bacteroide and a variety of cyanobacteria was observed in our study. The effect of specific bacteria is found to be significantly negatively correlated with the prevalence of a wide range of cyanobacteria, which is consistent with the results of many extant studies. These extant studies indicate that the formation of cyanobacterial communities is primarily influenced by microorganisms in the environment. The results of this study will provide new and complementary evidence on the mechanisms of cyanobacterial bloom occurrence and development and the design of management strategies.","In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the frequency and duration of cyanobacterial blooms, which has attracted widespread attention from all sectors of society.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of LNT on lactation performance and rumen fermentation in dairy cows. Through random block design, 80 Holstein cows were randomly assigned to four treatments (CON, control group, fed a basal diet; and 5LNT, 10LNT, 15LNT groups, fed a basal diet with 5, 10, 15 g/d LNT, respectively) according to the days in milk (57 ± 21.3 d), milk yield (42.3 ± 7.88 kg/d) and parity (3.44 ± 1.45). Each treatment had 20 replicates of one cow each. The results showed that there was a linear increment in the production of milk (<i>P</i> = 0.034, increased by 3.28 kg/d), milk protein (<i>P</i> = 0.020, increased by 76.04 g/d) and lactose (<i>P</i> = 0.003, increased by 213.07 g/d) with the increase in LNT doses. In addition, the apparent digestibility of crude protein (CP) linearly increased with the increasing LNT supplementation (<i>P</i> = 0.008, increased by 15.42%). In terms of ruminal fermentation, oxidation-reduction potential value (<i>P</i> = 0.001, reduced by 35.89), the proportion of acetate (<i>P</i> = 0.004, reduced by 8.91%) and acetate to propionate ratio (A/P; <i>P</i> = 0.002, reduced by 1.27) linearly decreased, while the proportion of propionate (<i>P</i> = 0.003, increased by 6.42%) and butyrate (<i>P</i> = 0.037, increased by 2.49%) linearly increased with the increase in LNT dosages. The changes in ruminal fermentation parameters led to changes in the ruminal microbiota and metabolites. Supplementation with LNT increased the relative abundance of some beneficial bacteria, such as Muribaculaceae and Lachnospiraceae (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and decreased the relative abundance of some harmful bacteria, such as Rhodobacteraceae, <i>Tyzzerella</i>, <i>Lysinibacillus</i> and <i>Turicibacter</i> (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Moreover, LNT supplementation up-regulated 2-(pyridin-2-ylamino) benzoic acid and hippuric acid (<i>P</i> < 0.05), which could promote phenylalanine metabolism, and down-regulated some metabolites inhibiting arginine biosynthesis, like 2-methylglutaric acid and N2-acetylornithine (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Moreover, lentinan supplementation significantly elevated 2-(pyridin-2-ylamino)benzoic acid (Py-PABA) and hippurate (<i>P</i> < 0.05), metabolites associated with enhanced phenylalanine metabolism, while reducing inhibitors of arginine biosynthesis such as 2-methylglutaric acid and N²-acetylornithine (<i>P</i> < 0.05). In conclusion, supplementation of LNT could improve the ruminal microbiota and metabolism and further affect the lactation performance of cows.","Lentinan (LNT) is a bioactive polysaccharide that has been proven to improve the production performance of animals. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of LNT on lactation performance and rumen fermentation in dairy cows. Through random block design, 80 Holstein cows were randomly assigned to four treatments (CON, control group, fed a basal diet; and 5LNT, 10LNT, 15LNT groups, fed a basal diet with 5, 10, 15 g/d LNT, respectively) according to the days in milk (57 ± 21.3 d), milk yield (42.3 ± 7.88 kg/d) and parity (3.44 ± 1.45). Each treatment had 20 replicates of one cow each. The results showed that there was a linear increment in the production of milk (<i>P</i> = 0.034, increased by 3.28 kg/d), milk protein (<i>P</i> = 0.020, increased by 76.04 g/d) and lactose (<i>P</i> = 0.003, increased by 213.07 g/d) with the increase in LNT doses. In addition, the apparent digestibility of crude protein (CP) linearly increased with the increasing LNT supplementation (<i>P</i> = 0.008, increased by 15.42%). In terms of ruminal fermentation, oxidation-reduction potential value (<i>P</i> = 0.001, reduced by 35.89), the proportion of acetate (<i>P</i> = 0.004, reduced by 8.91%) and acetate to propionate ratio (A/P; <i>P</i> = 0.002, reduced by 1.27) linearly decreased, while the proportion of propionate (<i>P</i> = 0.003, increased by 6.42%) and butyrate (<i>P</i> = 0.037, increased by 2.49%) linearly increased with the increase in LNT dosages. The changes in ruminal fermentation parameters led to changes in the ruminal microbiota and metabolites. Supplementation with LNT increased the relative abundance of some beneficial bacteria, such as Muribaculaceae and Lachnospiraceae (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and decreased the relative abundance of some harmful bacteria, such as Rhodobacteraceae, <i>Tyzzerella</i>, <i>Lysinibacillus</i> and <i>Turicibacter</i> (<i>P</i> < 0.05).

10.1016/j.onehlt.2025.101060,Limited diversity of bat-associated RNA viruses in endangered and geographically isolated Christmas Island flying foxes.,"Bats are commonly thought to harbour a high diversity and abundance of RNA viruses, some of which are able to jump species boundaries to emerge in new hosts. However, gaps remain in our understanding of the ecological factors that shape the bat virome and influence the diversity, circulation and population persistence of viral infections. Flying foxes (Pteropodidae) are representative of the chiropteran fauna in Australia, holding significant ecological, cultural, and social importance. However, some species have also been linked to the circulation of mammalian pathogens such as Hendra virus and Australian bat lyssavirus. Here, we characterised the RNA virome of the Christmas Island flying fox (<i>Pteropus melanotus natalis</i>), a native and endangered species only found on the remote Australian territory of Christmas Island. Through metatranscriptomic sequencing of 46 samples, including faeces, blood, urine and tissue lesions, we found that these bats exhibit limited RNA virus diversity dominated by dietary viruses. The paucity of RNA viruses likely reflects their small population size (between 1500 and 2600 individuals) and geographic isolation from other bat and mammalian species, except for pests and humans. However, we identified a novel alphacoronavirus in urine, related to viruses circulating in microbats in mainland Australia, and a picorna-like virus related to picornaviruses found in invertebrates. Although this novel picorna-like virus may be of a dietary origin, these flying foxes predominantly eat nectar, pollen and fruit, and viral RNA was also present in blood, urine and wing lesion samples. Overall, these data reveal how ecological factors have a profound impact on RNA virome diversity, highlighting risks to bat conservation, and showing that bats are not always major reservoirs for zoonotic viruses.","Bats are commonly thought to harbour a high diversity and abundance of RNA viruses, some of which are able to jump species boundaries to emerge in new hosts.

SARS-CoV-2 infection has been linked to the high-affinity high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor scavenger receptor class B, type 1 (SR-B1). Mechanisms by which SR-B1 supports SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, as well as the breadth of viruses that exploit this receptor, are incompletely defined. In evaluating the role of SR-B1 in the biology of infection with SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus, we show that SR-B1 chemical inhibition or knockout adversely affects infection for these viruses. Inhibiting SR-B1 results in lack of acidification in the endolysosomal compartment and entrapment of SARS-CoV-2 in endosomal-lysosomal vesicles. These findings together indicate that SR-B1, and possibly HDL, is critical for successful SARS-CoV-2 trafficking through a pH-dependent vesicular entry pathway.

Viral infection can alter host metabolic homeostasis, while its changes may influence disease severity and progression. The relationship between MPXV and metabolites has not been reported. we employed metabolomics to characterize the mpox specific metabolic features by comparing changes in urinary metabolites from patients with MPXV infection, HIV infection, and HIV-MPXV co-infection. The metabolic changes caused by MPXV were mainly concentrated in amino acid and hormone metabolism. Further analysis showed that 5'-dihydroadenosine and uric acid can serve as potential molecular markers for MPXV and HIV-MPXV co-infected patients, respectively. Confirmed by targeted metabolomics and ELISA methods, MPXV infection caused severe disorders in the metabolic pathways of steroid hormones such as testosterone and progesterone in humans. Our findings identify dysregulated metabolism as an underpinning of MPXV pathogenicity, and increasing the anti-inflammatory capacity of patients may play a role to some extent against mpox.","Monkeypox virus (MPXV) poses a global health threat.

However, information related to the impact of HIV co-infection in patients with advanced fibrosis is scarce. The aim was to analyze the impact of HIV co-infection on the LS dynamics after HCV cure. Prospective study conducted in the GEHEP-011 multicenter cohort (initiated in October 2011-November 2023, ID NCT04460157), including patients with chronic HCV infection, with or without HIV co-infection, fulfilling: 1) SVR with direct-acting antivirals; 2) pre-treatment LS ≥ 9.5 kPa; 3) available measurement of LS at SVR. Pre-treatment, SVR and annual post-treatment LS were assessed. The primary outcome was time to LS normalization achievement (≤7.2 kPa) in two consecutive examinations. 1138 patients were included, 678 (60%) of whom were living with HIV (PLWH). The median time between the first to the last measure was 35 (17-69) months. In total, 390 [34% (95% confidence interval, 31%-37%)] patients achieved LS normalization, 169 [37% (CI 95%, 34%-43%)] individuals with HCV mono-infection vs. 221 [32% (CI 95%, 29%-36%)] PLWH achieved LS normalization (p = 0.003). The propensity score (PS) for HIV infection was calculated. In a multivariate model for competing risks (death was the competing event) adjusted for HIV, PS and diabetes, HIV infection was associated with a lower probability of achieving normalization [sHR = 0.82 (95% CI, 0.67-1.00), p = 0.045]. Matching by closer PS was performed. In the resultant subset, the probability of achieving LS normalization was again lower in PLWH [sHR = 0.76 (0.56-0.97), p < 0.001]. After SVR, the probability of reaching LS normalization is significantly lower in PLWH. This could have implications on the development of long-term clinical events.

Long-term complications can include pancreatic exocrine and endocrine insufficiency, with gut microbiota (GM) playing a significant role in pancreatic diseases. Although previous studies have established a connection between gut microbiota dysbiosis and the onset of necrotizing pancreatitis, the composition of GM in patients who have experienced post-NP post-necrotizing pancreatitis remains largely unexamined. We conducted a single-center, prospective, long-term follow-up study of 88 participants, including 68 NP patients and 20 healthy controls. NP patients were divided into NP (onset-NP) and PNP groups based on disease progression. Gut microbial diversity and composition were assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing, followed by bioinformatic analyses such as Alpha and Beta diversity metrics, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), and functional pathway predictions. Clinical data were correlated with GM profiles to evaluate associations. 29.5% and 19.1% of NP patients progressed to pancreatic endocrine and exocrine insufficiency, respectively. Alpha and Beta diversity analyses revealed significantly lower microbial diversity in NP and PNP groups. Dysbiosis was characterized by a reduction in beneficial bacteria such as <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> and <i>Bacteroidaceae</i>, and an increase in opportunistic pathogens such as <i>Streptococcus</i> and <i>Enterobacter</i>. Functional prediction suggested disruptions in cellular processes, including apoptosis and necroptosis, and links to pathways associated with inflammatory and metabolic diseases. Correlation analyses demonstrated significant associations between GM alterations and clinical markers of inflammation, such as IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and Procalcitonin (PCT). Our findings highlight distinct GM profiles in NP and PNP patients compared to healthy controls, with partial recovery of beneficial flora in PNP patients. The study underscores the role of GM dysbiosis in NP progression and long-term outcomes, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets and strategies to improve patient management and quality of life. Future studies should explore multicenter validations and the mechanisms linking GM alterations to clinical outcomes.","Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common digestive disorder, with necrotizing pancreatitis (NP) occurring in 20% of cases.

Shandong Province Pediatric bacterial & fungal Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (SPARSS) program was established in 2017 to monitor and analyze the trends of bacterial epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance in children. Clinical bacterial isolates were collected from 59 tertiary hospital in Shandong Province China during 2017 to 2022. We conducted a retrospective analysis of bacterial distribution and resistance patterns, utilizing data from the SPARSS network and analyzed with WHONET 5.6 software. A total of 185,274 isolates were collected, and the top 5 bacteria were <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (19.0%), <i>Escherichia coli</i> (12.8%), <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (12.3%), <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> (11.0%) and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (7.1%). In the composition of strain specimens, most of the strains came from the respiratory tract (59.8%), followed by pus (11.4%). The resistance rate of <i>Staphylococcus spp</i>. to penicillins remains high at 90%, while the resistance rate to linezolid is low but shows an upward trend. Vancomycin-resistant strains have emerged in <i>Enterococcus spp</i>. which due to its complex genetic structure, possesses inherent resistance to most drugs. The resistance rate of <i>Enterobacter spp</i>. to meropenem remains low, although it exhibits a high resistance rate to β-lactams. Notably, carbapenem-resistant <i>Salmonella spp</i>. has been identified since from 2022. <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> demonstrate high drug resistance to most antibiotics. <i>H. influenzae</i> and <i>Moraxella catarrhalis</i>, primarily isolated from respiratory tract samples, show an increasing trend in β-lactamase-producing strains annually. The detection rates of multi-drug-resistant bacteria, including MRSA, CREO, CRKP, CRPA, and CRAB, have been decreasing annually, with their distribution varying among children of different ages. The resistance rate of <i>Candida tropicalis</i> to fluconazole was 43.6%, which was much higher than the detection rate of adults in China and Europe. Despite restrictions on antibiotic use in China, the situation of bacterial drug resistance remains critical, particularly in children. Therefore, long-term monitoring of bacterial drug resistance in this population is essential to develop effective strategies for the early and accurate treatment of childhood infections.","Bacterial antimicrobial resistance is becoming increasingly serious, but there are very limited studies in children.

In this work, we present a new potential target for antibiotics represented by a <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> type I toxin-antitoxin system where RNA-RNA interactions are responsible for silencing the synthesis of a toxin that is lethal to bacteria and that is activated only under particular conditions. We report the design and synthesis of new RNA binders to inhibit these RNA-RNA interactions and to artificially activate toxin production and kill bacteria. After screening these compounds using several complementary assays, we identified a selective inhibitor of the targeted RNA-RNA interaction showing specific antibiotic activity against <i>H. pylori</i>. This represents an unprecedented antimicrobial strategy based on the use of compounds that are not toxic by themselves but activate the production of an endogenous toxin produced by the bacteria themselves.

Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are natural or engineered viruses that specifically replicate in and lyse tumor cells, triggering inflammation which recruits immune effector cells to the site of infection. These conditions theoretically synergize with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), which aids in establishing and maintaining tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells. However, clinical data directly confirming synergy between OV and ICB therapy is limited despite ICB becoming the standard of care for several cancer types. It has been shown that viral immunodominance may limit antitumor T-cell priming and cause the attrition of tumor-specific T cells, limiting long-term therapeutic efficacy. To overcome these barriers, precise incorporation of virally expressed or exogenously administered tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) can synchronize the expansion of both antiviral and antitumor T cells, creating optimal conditions for ICB treatment. This tripartite approach leverages our understanding of antiviral immunity to efficiently expand subdominant antitumor T cells <i>in vivo</i>. In this review, we dissect the fundamental paradigm of immunovirotherapy regarding antiviral inflammation and TAAs, followed by relevant combinatorial strategies employed in preclinical and clinical settings for the treatment of solid tumors.","Immunovirotherapy integrates the oncolytic capabilities of viruses with the modulation of the host immune system to establish robust tumor-specific immune responses.

10.1002/sim.70135,A Comparison Between Markov Switching Zero-Inflated and Hurdle Models for Spatio-Temporal Infectious Disease Counts.,"In epidemiological studies, zero-inflated and hurdle models are commonly used to handle excess zeros in reported infectious disease cases. However, they cannot model the persistence (transition from presence to presence) and reemergence (transition from absence to presence) of a disease separately. Covariates can sometimes have different effects on the reemergence and persistence of a disease. Recently, a zero-inflated Markov switching negative binomial model was proposed to accommodate this issue. We introduce a Markov switching negative binomial hurdle model as a competitor of that approach, as hurdle models are often also used as alternatives to zero-inflated models for accommodating excess zeroes. We begin the comparison by inspecting the underlying assumptions made by both models. Hurdle models assume perfect detection of the disease cases while zero-inflated models implicitly assume the case counts can be under-reported, thus, we investigate when a negative binomial distribution can approximate the true distribution of reported counts. A comparison of the fit of the two types of Markov switching models is undertaken on chikungunya cases across the neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro. We find that, among the fitted models, the Markov switching negative binomial zero-inflated model produces the best predictions, and both Markov switching models produce remarkably better predictions than more traditional negative binomial hurdle and zero-inflated models.","In epidemiological studies, zero-inflated and hurdle models are commonly used to handle excess zeros in reported infectious disease cases.

The aim of the study is to identify the possible factors that can influence the presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in donated human milk (DHM). <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Next-generation sequencing and selective microbiological culturing of samples from pools of raw DHM were performed. Data on the donors, their children, and the milk are correlated with the microbiological findings. A regression model is performed, to predict the probability of the presence of the genera <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The abundance of the genus <i>Bifidobacterium</i> positively correlated with the donor's body mass index (<i>p</i> = 0.050). The abundance of the <i>Lactobacillus</i> positively correlated with the lactation age (<i>p</i> = 0.007) and negatively with the total bacterial count on blood agar (<i>p</i> = 0.001). The abundance of the <i>Bifidobacterium</i> positively correlated with the growth on selective transgalactosylated oligosaccharides-propionate agar media (<i>p</i> = 0.036).

We collected western pond turtles (Actinemys marmorata and Actinemys pallida) from six San Francisco Bay Area, California, US, ponds; assessed their shells for lesions; and collected shell swabs and keratin scrape samples to evaluate bacteriome differences between the whole shell (swabs) and the affected tissues (scrapes). We quantified shell lesion type and prevalence by using visual inspections of photographs collected of the plastron and carapace and then applied 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize the associated bacteriomes of shells that observed pits, ulcerations, or no lesions. We observed shell lesions at high frequencies throughout our sites, with larger individuals (>100-mm plastron length) more likely to possess injuries. We saw no differences in alpha diversities between shells presenting with lesions and those on which we did not observe lesions; however, swab samples showed higher bacterial richness than keratin scrapes. The bacterial composition within the scrapes was influenced by pond location and then lesion presence. We observed a higher relative abundance of Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota, Cyanobacteria, and Deinococcota in the shell keratin microflora of turtles with shell lesions. Because western pond turtles are under consideration for listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 in the US, understanding patterns of shell disease pathologies and the bacteria associated with disease is imperative for the management of current populations.","Bacteriome characterization studies can provide insights into the microbial ecology associated with disease.

To enhance the efficiency of CVB4 research, we developed the rCVB4-EGFP and rCVB4-NanoLuc reporter viruses. The replication kinetics of these reporter viruses in SH-SY5Y and HeLa cells were essentially consistent with those of the wild-type CVB4. A strong correlation was observed between the fluorescence and bioluminescence signals of rCVB4-EGFP and rCVB4-NanoLuc and viral titers at specific times postinfection. When evaluating the anti-CVB4 drug fluoxetine using these reporter viruses, the half-maximal effective concentrations derived from fluorescence signals, bioluminescence signal intensities, and viral genome copies were consistent. In In Vivo drug evaluations, because CVB4 can infect various tissues and organs, the bioluminescence signal of rCVB4-NanoLuc effectively demonstrated the antiviral effects of drugs, offering significant advantages over traditional tissue viral titer analysis. The reporter viruses exhibited reduced virulence compared with wild-type CVB4 both In Vitro, in SH-SY5Y and HeLa cells, and In Vivo, in ICR suckling mice.

Protein kinase D (PKD) is implicated in the regulation of numerous physiological processes, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and intracellular signaling. PKD plays a pivotal role in regulating the function and phenotypic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs); however, further studies are necessary to elucidate the role of PKD in vascular calcification. VSMCs were used to establish an in vitro calcification model. Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were selected to establish a vitamin D3 (Vitd3)-induced calcification model in vivo. Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV 9)-PKD or AAV 9-negative control was injected via tail vein 2 weeks before injecting Vitd3 into the mice. Protein expression levels of the P53-SLC7A11 pathway were determined in both ex vivo and in vivo experiments. The degree of calcification was assessed by Alizarin red S (ARS) staining and calcium content measurement. We found that PKD was upregulated in ex vivo and in vivo models of vascular calcification. The inhibition of PKD resulted in a reduction in the expression of ferroptosis-related genes and osteogenic differentiation of VSMCs, which in turn led to a mitigation of vascular calcification. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that the P53-SLC7A11 signaling pathway is a key mediator of PKD-induced vascular calcification. The results of this study indicate that PKD knockdown alleviates vascular calcification through the P53-SLC7A11 axis-mediated ferroptosis.","Vascular calcification results in the hardening and weakening of the vascular wall, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease.

10.1002/jia2.26508,Measuring mobility in HIV research in sub-Saharan Africa: a scoping review.,"Mobility-from overnight travel to permanent migration-can reduce service access and increase HIV risk, driving the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This scoping review described mobility measures used in HIV research to identify gaps and guide research on mobility to strengthen HIV responses in SSA. Literature from three databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science) were systematically screened to identify research articles examining relationships between mobility and individual-level HIV-related outcomes in SSA from 2014 through 2023. Key terms for mobility included ""mobility,"" ""movement,"" ""migration"" and ""travel."" Measures were first extracted according to International Organization of Migration definitions of migration (a change in the place of usual residence) and travel (movement between geographies). Then, metrics used to categorize or quantify mobility were organized by the stage (origin, transit, destination, return) and dimension (spatial, temporal, socio-structural) of the movement captured. Measures were analysed within three research contexts: the HIV outcome(s) of interest, study population and local geographies. Outcomes included HIV acquisition, AIDS-related death, and indicators along the prevention, care and treatment cascade. We identified 69 studies after screening 5343 titles/abstracts and 200 full texts for eligibility. Studies included research from 16 countries, mostly representing general adult populations in eastern and southern Africa. Most studies measured migration (51) versus travel (21) and examined relationships with HIV prevalent infection (29) or care and treatment indicators (44) compared to other epidemiological and programmatic outcomes. Studies employed a range of metrics, mostly of the duration of stay at the destination (28), the number of mobility events (12) or the geographic boundaries across which individuals moved (14). Socio-structural dimensions like the motivation for movement were measured less often. Only 15 studies examined more than one dimension. Mobility measures varied widely and were inconsistently studied across research contexts. Future studies should fill evidence gaps, standardize reporting and develop multidimensional mobility measures tailored to local settings and HIV outcomes. People on the move are a vast and diverse group, yet they are often labelled as a monolith. Improved measures can disentangle how different forms of mobility relate to HIV, generating actionable evidence to enhance HIV programming for ending the epidemic.","Mobility-from overnight travel to permanent migration-can reduce service access and increase HIV risk, driving the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).

Measures were first extracted according to International Organization of Migration definitions of migration (a change in the place of usual residence) and travel (movement between geographies). Then, metrics used to categorize or quantify mobility were organized by the stage (origin, transit, destination, return) and dimension (spatial, temporal, socio-structural) of the movement captured. Measures were analysed within three research contexts: the HIV outcome(s) of interest, study population and local geographies. Outcomes included HIV acquisition, AIDS-related death, and indicators along the prevention, care and treatment cascade. We identified 69 studies after screening 5343 titles/abstracts and 200 full texts for eligibility. Studies included research from 16 countries, mostly representing general adult populations in eastern and southern Africa. Most studies measured migration (51) versus travel (21) and examined relationships with HIV prevalent infection (29) or care and treatment indicators (44) compared to other epidemiological and programmatic outcomes. Studies employed a range of metrics, mostly of the duration of stay at the destination (28), the number of mobility events (12) or the geographic boundaries across which individuals moved (14). Socio-structural dimensions like the motivation for movement were measured less often. Only 15 studies examined more than one dimension. Mobility measures varied widely and were inconsistently studied across research contexts. Future studies should fill evidence gaps, standardize reporting and develop multidimensional mobility measures tailored to local settings and HIV outcomes. People on the move are a vast and diverse group, yet they are often labelled as a monolith. Improved measures can disentangle how different forms of mobility relate to HIV, generating actionable evidence to enhance HIV programming for ending the epidemic.",PubMed

However, there is little knowledge about the methanol-pharmaceutical activities of Chrysanthemum indicum leaves and flowers. This study is designed to assess the in vitro antioxidant, anticancer, and antibacterial activities of C. indicum extracts. The flowers and leaves of C. indicum are extracted. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is used to analyze the chemical components. The antioxidant activity is evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrilhidrazine (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assays. Cytotoxic effect against A549 cell line is identified. The antibacterial properties are evaluated against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Antioxidant activity is detected and observed to be maximum at higher concentrations. The IC50 values of flowers and leaves are 77.19 ± 2.4 and 101.94 ± 2.34 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, in the DPPH method, whereas the ABTS assay shows 93.21 ± 3.42 and 98.22 ± 3.34 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The flower extract has more cytotoxic activity than the leaves (P < 0.05). The IC50 values for flowers and leaves are 72.49 ± 3.14 and 102.54 ± 4.17 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Furthermore, the flower and leaf extracts exhibit the most pronounced antibacterial activity.

This study develops an oral pH-responsive probiotic-liposome hybrid system (EcN<sup>PIN</sup>-L) by conjugating Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) with pinocembrin (PIN)-loaded liposomes (B-Lip-PIN) via biotin-streptavidin binding and encapsulating them in Eudragit L100-55 (L100-55). The system resists gastric acid, releases bacteria in intestinal pH conditions, and combines PIN's anti-inflammatory properties with EcN's probiotic effects. In irradiated mice, EcN<sup>PIN</sup>-L demonstrates effective intestinal colonization and multiple therapeutic benefits: it reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-17A), enhances intestinal barrier function, and decreases epithelial apoptosis. 16S rRNA sequencing reveals improved microbiota homeostasis with increased beneficial bacteria and decreased harmful species. The system shows superior efficacy compared to individual components, addressing both inflammatory damage and microbial dysbiosis while maintaining biocompatibility. These results highlight EcN<sup>PIN</sup>-L as a promising dual-mechanism therapy for radiation-induced intestinal injury, offering targeted delivery and combined anti-inflammatory/microbiome-modulating action.","Radiation-induced intestinal injury poses significant clinical challenges in radiotherapy.

10.1021/jacs.5c07388,The Isopropylstilbene Precursor Cinnamic Acid Inhibits Anthraquinone Pigment Production by Targeting AntI.,"<i>Photorhabdus</i> strains, Gram-negative bacteria pathogenic to insect larvae, produce two signature compounds: the multifunctional isopropylstilbene (IPS), known for its antibiotic, insecticidal, and immunosuppressive activities, and orange-to-red pigmented anthraquinones (AQs), which attenuate oxidative stress. Here, we demonstrate an inverse correlation between the production of AQs and cinnamic acid (CA), the primary precursor for IPS formation in the model strain <i>P. laumondii</i> TTO1. Metabolic and proteomic analyses following CA treatment show that CA inhibits AntI, a key enzyme in the final step of AQ-256 biosynthesis. The crystal structure of AntI in complex with CA reveals that cinnamic acid functions as a competitive inhibitor by inducing specific structural rearrangements in the lyase, resulting in noncovalent, reversible inhibition. These findings provide atomic insights into the intricate regulatory control of pigment biosynthesis and the production of bioactive compounds.","<i>Photorhabdus</i> strains, Gram-negative bacteria pathogenic to insect larvae, produce two signature compounds: the multifunctional isopropylstilbene (IPS), known for its antibiotic, insecticidal, and immunosuppressive activities, and orange-to-red pigmented anthraquinones (AQs), which attenuate oxidative stress.

Climate change, and particularly the loss of sea ice, is rapidly altering this ecologically vulnerable and economically important system. In this study, the EBS protist community was characterized across recent years with drastic differences in sea ice extent. In 2019, when the extent of sea ice was anomalously low and retreat occurred early, increased fall water temperatures and surface salinities were observed, and the protist community was dominated by apicomplexan parasites. In contrast, 2017 had more typical winter sea ice conditions and in the fall, water temperatures and surface salinities were lower and protist communities were more diverse, with a larger ratio of primary producer to consumer protists compared to 2019. Surface water temperature was identified as a key predictor of apicomplexan compositional abundance and may be important in the life histories of parasites and their hosts. The interannual variability observed here indicates that the transfer of energy and biomass through the EBS ecosystem can differ drastically across years with differential sea ice influence and highlights the need to monitor protist communities and explore the impacts of protistan parasites.","Marine protists in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) are understudied despite being a critical component of the productive subarctic ecosystem.

Isoprene, the major volatile secondary metabolite released by plants, can support the carbon and energy needs of a variety of bacteria. Here we show that Sphagnum moss from an acidic bog harboured highly active isoprene degraders which consumed the vast majority of the plant-produced isoprene, preventing its release to the atmosphere. We quantified the potential for microbial isoprene uptake in the moss and, using alkyne inhibitors specific to either isoprene monooxygenase of bona fide isoprene degraders, or to the enzymes of other microbes capable of its fortuitous co-oxidation, we show that methane utilizers, for example, did not oxidise significant isoprene in incubations. Our technique enabled the separate quantification of plant isoprene production and microbial uptake, revealing that although atmospheric isoprene concentrations are typically low, the microbes contained in, or in close association with the moss were capable of isoprene uptake at the plant-generated isoprene concentration. Analysis of the bacterial community suggested that the isoprene degraders in this environment belonged to novel groups distinct from extant strains with this capability.","Northern peatlands, ecosystems which store enormous amounts of carbon, and yet are major sources of methane and plant-derived volatiles including isoprene, are predicted to be greatly affected by climate change.

10.1186/s40851-025-00252-5,Morphological feminization in hermit crabs (family Paguridae) induced by rhizocephalan barnacles.,"Rhizocephalans (Thecostraca: Cirripedia) are parasitic crustaceans that infect a wide range of decapod hosts, including hermit crabs, crabs, and shrimps. These parasites exert profound effects on their hosts, inducing parasitic castration, suppressing the development of secondary sexual characteristics, feminizing male crabs, and altering male behavior to resemble that of females. In the present study, we examined the secondary sexual characteristics of two hermit crab species- Pagurus lanuginosus from Asari (Hokkaido, Japan) on the Sea of Japan coast and Pagurus filholi from Chikura (Chiba, Japan) on the Pacific coast-parasitized by Peltogasterella gracilis and Peltogaster sp., respectively. Specifically, we assessed the presence of secondary pleopods and the length of the right large cheliped. Our findings demonstrate that male P. lanuginosus and P. filholi parasitized by P. gracilis and Peltogaster sp. exhibit morphological changes and characteristics of females, confirming morphological feminization. The magnitude of parasitic effects on morphological feminization varies between the two host species depending on the rhizocephalan genus. Thus, the extent of feminization varies depending on the parasite genus. Notably, different parasite genera induced varying degrees of host modification, even within the same host species. Similarly, the level of feminization caused by a single parasite genus differed between host species. These results highlight the importance of understanding the characteristics of both the hermit crab host and rhizocephalan parasite in developing insights into parasitically induced morphological feminization.","Rhizocephalans (Thecostraca: Cirripedia) are parasitic crustaceans that infect a wide range of decapod hosts, including hermit crabs, crabs, and shrimps.

Identifying viruses that are shared between individual plants, or members of the “core virome”, could reveal stable viral populations with the potential to modulate the composition and function of the microbiome. Here, we examined the virome associated with <i>Sphagnum</i> mosses, a keystone species that has direct influence over the fate of peatland carbon stores. We analyzed bulk metagenomes and metatranscriptomes generated from <i>Sphagnum</i> field samples collected over a ten-month period to identify virus-like sequences shared among plants. Individual <i>Sphagnum</i> samples harbored distinct DNA and RNA viromes where only a small percentage (< 1%) of the total number of identified viral contigs were shared among all samples. Based on taxonomic classification, the shared viral contigs represent bacterial viruses, or phage (<i>Caudoviricetes</i>), as well as viruses of eukaryotes, namely nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (<i>Nucleocytoviricota</i>) and RNA viruses (<i>Riboviria</i>). We linked the shared phage-like contigs to viral regions within sequenced genomes of bacterial taxa that are members of the <i>Sphagnum</i> core microbiome, suggesting that these contigs represent temperate phage or degraded prophage. The putative nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses and RNA viruses were phylogenetically diverse and showed sequence similarity to viruses associated with a broad range of hosts and environmental sources. The identification of shared viral contigs suggested that, despite the compositional heterogeneity between samples, <i>Sphagnum</i> mosses may harbor a core virome. Future work validating the presence of the core virome is warranted as it may aid in understanding how persistent viruses impact microbiome ecology and symbiont evolution within this climatically relevant keystone species.

The currently approved drugs have significant limitations, but antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as promising therapeutic alternatives. Members of the cruzioseptin family, a group of AMPs derived from the frog Cruziohyla calcarifer, have demonstrated anti-T. cruzi activity, but their mode of action remains poorly understood. Herein, T. cruzi epimastigotes were used to identify active cruzioseptins and investigate their mechanism of action through untargeted metabolomics and molecular dynamics simulations. Synthetic versions of three previously unstudied cruzioseptins (CZS-5, CZS-7, and CZS-11) were evaluated for their effects on T. cruzi X-1081 epimastigotes via microplate assays with resazurin-based viability measurements. CZS-1, a peptide with known anti-T. cruzi activity, was also included. Selectivity was assessed via hemolysis assays on human erythrocytes. To evaluate membrane damage, DNA leakage assays and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed on epimastigotes treated with CZS-5. In addition, the interaction of cruzioseptins with the epimastigote membrane was modeled using molecular dynamics simulations. To explore additional mechanisms of action, a multiplatform metabolomic analysis (HILIC-LC-QTOF-MS and GC-QTOF-MS) was conducted to identify altered metabolites in epimastigotes treated with CZS-5. Among the tested cruzioseptins, CZS-5 exhibited the highest potency (IC<sub>50</sub> = 4.7 ± 1.0 µM) and selectivity (SI = 50.3). This peptide induced DNA leakage from epimastigotes and caused surface alterations, suggesting membrane damage. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that CZS-5 may exert its effects through the formation of toroidal pores in the parasite membrane. Untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed 118 altered metabolites in CZS-5-treated epimastigotes, with significant enrichment of glycerophospholipids (40.7%), supporting the involvement of membrane disruption. In addition, metabolic pathways were affected, suggesting complementary mechanisms of action, including oxidative stress and disruptions in energy metabolism. CZS-5 was identified as a potent cruzioseptin with multiple potential mechanisms of action in the epimastigotes stage of T. cruzi. Further validation is needed in clinically relevant parasite stages to assess its potential as a therapeutic agent.","Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a neglected tropical illness affecting an estimated 6-7 million people worldwide.

The present study is aimed at updating current knowledge of the composition of potential vector species in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, a traditionally endemic area for D. immitis and D. repens. Mosquitoes were collected in 2022 and 2023 as part of the regional surveillance plan for West Nile Virus (WNV). The capture zones included peri-urban and rural areas and mosquitoes were captured with CDC-CO<sub>2</sub> traps. DNA from approximately 30% of female mosquitoes of each captured species (Culex pipiens, Aedes caspius, Aedes vexans, Aedes albopictus) was extracted and analyzed for the presence of D. immitis and D. repens. A total of 140 pools (~ 20 mosquitoes each) in 2022 and 133 in 2023 have been analyzed. DNA of D. immitis was identified in 14 pools in 2022 and in 15 pools in 2023. None of the pools was positive for D. repens. In 2022, about 85% of the positive pools belonged to Ae. caspius species (11/13) and the other three pools to Ae. vexans.

Recent evidence of mammal-to-mammal transmission has heightened concerns about the virus's potential adaptation to mammals. The polymerase basic 2 (PB2) protein E627K mutation appears to be of key importance for mammalian adaptation. We isolated an HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus from wild birds in Korea with 96% E and 4% K at amino acid position 627 of PB2. To investigate the genomic characteristics of this clade regarding mammalian adaptation, we studied the replication and transmission of the H5N1 virus in mice. Two experiments with different challenge-to-contact ratios were conducted to assess transmission dynamics and mutation development. In experiment 1, a 4:1 challenge-to-contact ratio resulted in 100% transmission among direct-contact mice, with all mice succumbing to the infection. In experiment 2, a 1:1 ratio yielded 50% transmission, with all challenged mice also succumbing. High viral loads were observed in the lungs and brains in both experiments, with viral titers increasing over time. Notably, the PB2-E627K variant, initially present at 4% in the virus stock, was selected and reached near-fixation (~ 100%) in the lungs and brains by 6 days post-challenge and was subsequently transmitted. No other mammalian-adaptive mutations were identified, emphasizing the pivotal role of PB2-E627K in early stages of mammalian adaptation. These findings highlight the need for continuous genomic monitoring to detect mammalian adaptation markers and assess interspecies transmission risks.","The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has rapidly disseminated globally, with mammalian infections reported in multiple species.

10.1186/s12985-025-02781-z,A phage-displayed nanobody-based competitive immunoassay for the detection of African swine fever virus antibodies.,"African swine fever (ASF) is a highly infectious and devastating disease that poses a significant threat to the global swine industry. The rapid spread of ASF and its ongoing pandemics continue to impact pig farming worldwide. The absence of an effective vaccine, coupled with the complexity of the African swine fever virus (ASFV), makes the control and eradication of ASF a formidable challenge. Nanobodies, derived from camelids, have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional monoclonal antibodies, offering distinct advantages in various biological applications. In this study, specific nanobodies targeting the ASFV K205R protein were selected from a phage-displayed immune library. Ten individual nanobodies were isolated based on their complementary determining regions (CDRs), and four were found to bind to the naive K205R protein of ASFV. After evaluation, nanobody VHH1 was selected for the development of a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for ASFV antibody detection. The assay was optimized for various reaction conditions, and the cut-off value was determined to be 26.85%, with diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 97.52% and 97.48%, respectively. No cross-reactivity was observed with sera from pigs infected with other swine viruses, and the assay exhibited a detection sensitivity of 1:128. Comparative analysis of clinical samples showed a high concordance rate (98.98%) between the nanobody-based and monoclonal antibody-based ELISAs (Mab-cELISA). In conclusion, this study presents a phage-displayed nanobody-based competitive ELISA for the detection of ASFV antibodies, which could be valuable for ASF sero-surveillance. Additionally, the K205R-specific nanobodies identified here may be adapted for other biological or biomedical applications.","African swine fever (ASF) is a highly infectious and devastating disease that poses a significant threat to the global swine industry.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted between April and June 2023 among PWUD frequenting the ODSC. A structured questionnaire, comprising sociodemographic information, substance use patterns, overdose history, and psychosocial support needs was used. A total of 119 participants were surveyed, with a majority identifying as male (79%) and an average age of 42 years. Heroin was the most frequently consumed substance (64.7%), followed by alcohol (56.3%) and crack/cocaine (21%). People who use crack (PWUC) were younger (mean age 36.6) and more likely to be homeless (56%) than respondents who are not using crack. The most mentioned support needs included housing (69.5%), bureaucratic assistance (60.2%), and health related support (51.7%).

In China, undergraduates are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection. Despite multiple prevention and control measures, HIV testing rates among undergraduates remain low. This study aims to elicit undergraduates' preferences for key characteristics of HIV testing options. Understanding their preference will help raise testing rates. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted among undergraduates in Wuhan, China. They were asked to make eight choices between two unlabeled alternatives that differed in five attributes (testing location, testing sample, additional services, testing cost, and minimum travel time). Data were analyzed using a mixed logit model. A total of 461 undergraduates provided valid responses for analyses. Most undergraduates were heterosexual (78.5%) and non-medical majors (81.8%). Testing location was the most important non-monetary attribute, followed by testing sample and whether additional services were offered with the test. Undergraduates preferred qualified medical institutions for HIV testing than self-testing at home (β = 1.640, P < 0.001). They favored oral fluid as a method to obtain the sample, relative to urine samples (β = 0.821, P < 0.001). Free health checks offered at HIV testing was the most significant driving factor for their choice of HIV testing services (β = 0.460, P < 0.001).

Unfortunately, vaccine coverage in the U.S. lags behind national and global targets. College students are an important audience for catch-up vaccination given suboptimal population coverage in adolescents. This study examined factors associated with college healthcare provider (HCP) practices for routinely screening HPV vaccination history of female college students. One thousand two hundred twenty-one U.S. college HCPs completed surveys and reported on a variety of screening practices in college health centers, including assessing the HPV vaccination status of female college students. Participants included nurse practitioners, physicians, and physician assistants. Forty-five percent of college HCPs reported routinely screening the HPV vaccination histories of most (≥ 70%) of their female students. Nurse practitioners (NPs) were more likely than other providers to consistently assess HPV vaccination status. In multivariable logistic regression modeling, high rates of routine HPV vaccination screening were associated with NP role, more positive provider attitudes and self-efficacy toward screening, larger institutions, college-level policies, in-service trainings and electronic health record prompts that supported HPV vaccination history screening. No differences were found by other provider demographic factors, institution type or region. College health centers present unique opportunities to identify unvaccinated female students and offer or refer them for vaccination. Future research needs to examine HPV vaccination status and screening among other types of college students and identify the multi-level factors that act as facilitators and barriers to assessing HPV vaccination status and offering the HPV vaccine.","HPV vaccination is highly effective in preventing HPV infection and subsequent precancers and invasive cancers related to HPV.

Thus, human microbiome data holds significant potential as a source of information for diagnosing and characterizing diseases-such as phenotypes, disease course, and therapeutic response-associated with dysbiotic microbiota communities. However, multiple attempts to leverage gut microbiota taxonomic data for diagnostic and disease characterization have failed due to significant inter-individual variability of microbiota community and overlap of disrupted microbiota communities among multiple diseases.

Vaccination has also been an integral component of infectious disease prevention and control and it has been used widely to protect humans against some of the very serious diseases such as COVID-19. People living with HIV (PLHIV) are known to be more vulnerable to the severest form of COVID-19 than the general population. Other groups of people likely to get the severe form of COVID-19 include the elderly and those with co-morbidities such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, etc. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of the study was to establish socio-demographic factors that could determine COVID-19 vaccination status among PLHIV in selected regions in mainland Tanzania and to provide insight into ways to increase COVID-19 vaccine coverage in Tanzania. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted between March and April 2022 among PLHIV in four conveniently sampled regions of Tanzania namely Kagera, Tabora, Geita, and Dar es Salaam.

In each CTC, 11 PLHIV eligible for vaccination were systematically selected to participate in the study. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire and Open Data Kit (ODK) software was used to record and transfer data to a designated server. Data cleaning and analysis were done using Stata version 14.0. A chi-square test was used to assess the association between socio-demographic characteristics and COVID-19 vaccination status. A generalized linear mixed-effects model was fitted to determine factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination status.

However, the impact of regular cannabis use on the neural oscillatory dynamics underlying motor control deficits in PWH remains less understood. Herein, 102 control cannabis users, control nonusers, PWH who regularly use cannabis, and PWH who do not use cannabis performed a motor control task with and without interference during high-density magnetoencephalography. The resulting neural dynamics were examined using whole-brain, voxel-wise statistical analyses that examined the impact of HIV status, cannabis use, and their interaction on the neural oscillations serving motor control, spontaneous activity during the baseline period, and neurobehavioral relationships. Our key findings revealed cannabis-by-HIV group interactions in oscillatory gamma within the prefrontal cortices, higher-order motor areas, and other regions, with the non-using PWH typically exhibiting the strongest gamma interference responses. Cannabis-by-HIV interactions were also found for oscillatory beta in the dorsal premotor cortex. Spontaneous gamma during the baseline was elevated in PWH and suppressed in cannabis users in all regions exhibiting interaction effects and the left primary motor cortex, with spontaneous levels being correlated with behavioral performance. These findings suggest that regular cannabis use has a normalizing effect on the neural oscillations serving motor control and the abnormally elevated spontaneous gamma activity that has been widely replicated in PWH, which may suggest that cannabis has at least some therapeutic utility in PWH.","Recent work has shown that people with HIV (PWH) exhibit deficits in cognitive control and altered brain responses in the underlying cortical networks, and that regular cannabis use has a normalizing effect on these neural responses.

This study evaluated the efficacy of formulated probiotic bacteria (Pseudomonas chlororaphis RO1, Bacillus subtilis RO8, and Bacillus velezensis RO9) as biological control agents in managing RKNs, Meloidogyne incognita in kiwifruit under both greenhouse and field conditions. In laboratory assays, B. velezensis RO9 exhibited the highest efficacy, achieving a 52.2% increase in second-stage juvenile nematodes (J2s) mortality compared to the control. The probiotic bacteria strains (RO1, RO8, and RO9) were formulated in two types: a humic acid-based liquid formulation and a microencapsulated form with slow-release capability. Greenhouse experiments revealed that the liquid formulation had the greatest effect on reducing the pathogenic indices of M. incognita. Specifically, RO1 and RO9 strains in humic acid-based liquid formulations were more effective than other treatments after two applications. Consequently, these two effective isolates (RO1 and RO9, liquid formulations) were selected for evaluation under field conditions. Field trials demonstrated that, following the chemical nematicide Cadusafos (Rugby<sup>®</sup>), RO1 in humic acid-based formulation was more effective than RO9 in reducing the soil population of J2s, as well as nematode eggs and juveniles in the roots. Moreover, RO9 formulation was slightly more beneficial in reducing the number of root galls and egg masses. Regarding the reproduction factor, both RO1 and RO9 liquid formulations were statistically similar to the chemical nematicide after two applications. Overall, the results indicate that the formulated products of P. chlororaphis RO1 and B. velezensis RO9 are effective in managing RKNs both in greenhouse and field conditions.","Commercial biocontrol of plant diseases such as plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) requires formulations that are effective under field conditions.

Using reverse vaccinology applied to a mucosal HIV-1 neutralizing IgA, we identified P7, a 12 amino-acid peptide at the interface of the N and C-helices of gp41. We now show that P7 interacts with the trimeric HIV-1 envelope cross-clade with a nanomolar affinity, captures gp41 in a 6-Helix Bundle conformation, and binds to infected cells and free virus. Functionally, P7 neutralizes HIV infection cross-clade and inhibits cell-to-cell viral transfer. Adding a lipid tail to P7 (Lipo-P7) improved neutralization of primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by Transmitted / Founder clade B and primary clades A and C viruses. Lipo-P7 also neutralized a T20-resistant virus harboring gp41 G36D, V38M mutations. Altogether, P7 appears as a promising cross-clade HIV-1 antiviral peptide that could also induce protective mucosal IgA levels to prevent sexual HIV infection.","HIV-1 envelope conformational changes necessary for viral infection make the gp41 subunit a key target for antiviral drugs.

Microbes in the environment, including bacteria and fungi, are adapting to new habitats and hosts in ways that may make them more disease-causing. Environmental fungi are particularly climate-sensitive, with optimal growth at cooler temperatures (25-30 °C) and with reproductive spore dispersal dependent on atmospheric conditions. While environmental fungi play a crucial role supporting plant growth and recycling nutrients in soils, some cause mild to severe infections in humans. Climate changes are expanding the geographic range of some disease-causing fungi, leading to increased fungal infections, particularly in the aftermath of natural disasters. Additionally, fungal adaptations to environmental stressors may make fungi more likely to cause disease, such as increased heat tolerance (survival at body temperature of 37 °C), or more difficult to treat, due to evolving drug resistance to environmental fungicides. Here, we explore how climate change and natural disasters impact fungal distribution, adaptation, and exposure to humans, highlighting fungal threats to human health. We propose strategies to mitigate these emerging challenges, emphasizing the collaborative and interdisciplinary efforts needed to protect human health in a changing climate.","Climate changes including rising temperatures and increasing severe weather events (e.g., hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires) are impacting Earth's ecosystems and increasing microbial threats to human health.

While host behaviors drive pathogen transmission, these behaviors vary individually which impacts both individual- and population-level disease outcomes. For example, delphinid species are regularly affected by serious respiratory diseases, but a lack of social behavior data means the structure of vulnerability in these ecosystem sentinels is poorly understood. To assess the role of variable social behavior on disease risk empirically, we collected behavioral data from two wild bottlenose dolphin populations (Tursiops spp.), developed network models that synthesize transmission contacts, and used an epidemiological model to predict disease consequences. We find that contacts are highly structured by age and sex, and that individuals preferentially contact others in their own demographic group. These patterns, in turn, drive heterogeneity in infection risk, which we support using empirical data from a past disease outbreak. Our work characterizes the impact of social dynamics on infectious disease risk, which can inform the structure of vulnerability for future epizootics across diverse delphinid species.","Infectious diseases cause mass mortalities in wildlife populations globally, but the impact of host sociality on the spread of pathogens is often unknown.

The laminated layer (LL) surrounding the parasite provides physical protection while modulating host immune responses. E. multilocularis' immunomodulatory mechanisms are poorly understood and we explored the role of phytic acid, a known component of E. granulosus sensu lato. We show that phytic acid is also present in E. multilocularis-infected tissue and impairs macrophage inflammation. In vivo, inflammatory macrophages accumulate near the metacestode, yet do not express IL-6, indicating anti-inflammatory modulation. In vitro, phytic acid reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1β by lowering intracellular calcium levels in macrophages. This calcium-chelating effect is mirrored by the anti-inflammatory properties of an E. multilocularis metacestode extract, revealing a protein-independent immune modulation strategy. These findings suggest that phytic acid plays a crucial role in E. multilocularis' ability to suppress host immune responses and supports the parasite's long-term survival.","The helminth Echinococcus multilocularis relies on immune evasion strategies to persist within its host.

DOA9 can nodulate a wide spectrum of legumes; however, unlike other bradyrhizobia, DOA9 carries a symbiotic plasmid harboring type III secretion system (T3SS) and several effector (T3E) genes, one of which encodes a putative type III effector SkP48. Here, we demonstrated the pivotal roles of SkP48 from Bradyrhizobium sp. DOA9 in inhibiting nodulation of various Vigna species and Crotalaria juncea and suppressing nodulation efficiency of Arachis hypogaea. By contrast, the nodulation efficiency of a SkP48 mutant did not differ significantly with the DOA9 wild-type strain on Macroptilium atropurpureum and Stylosanthes hamata. The SUMO domain of SkP48 is primarily responsible for the blocking nodulation phenotype V. radiata. An evolutionary analysis revealed that the SkP48 which contains a shikimate kinase and a SUMO protease (C48 cysteine peptidase) domain, SkP48 is distinct from other effectors previously reported in other bradyrhizobia and pathogenic bacteria. Our findings suggest that the putative T3E SkP48 is a key factor suppressing nodulation and nodule organogenesis in several legumes by activation of effector-triggered immunity through salicylic acid biosynthesis induction, which is deleterious to rhizobial infection.

Three reactors with varying solid retention times (SRTs) were operated: a control without sludge recycling (SRT = 20 days) and two experimental setups with SRTs of 40 and 80 days achieved through sludge return. Increasing SRT improved methane production and volatile solids reduction compared to the control, with reductions of 81.0-90.2% at the highest SRT. However, extended SRTs resulted in the accumulation of recalcitrant compounds, such as humic substances, and elevated hydrogen sulfide production due to the increased abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Microbial analysis showed that higher SRTs enhanced methanogenic diversity, including acetoclastic, hydrogenotrophic, and methylotrophic pathways, while promoting the coexistence of key methanogens such as Methanosaeta, Methanobrevibacter, and Methanoculleus. Although humic substances and SRB abundance increased with higher SRT, methane production remained stable, indicating limited actual inhibition under the studied conditions. Additionally, ATP and specific methanogenic activity tests indicated higher microbial activity at longer SRTs. These findings emphasize the impact of increasing SRT on AD performance, highlighting both benefits in methane yield and challenges in managing inhibitory by-products. Further research should optimize SRT to balance microbial activity, efficiency, and stability in AD processes.","This study investigates the effects of sludge recycling on anaerobic digestion (AD) performance and microbial community dynamics during food waste leachate treatment.

We identify a protein, UBP, that interacts with the ucm and additionally with hundreds of other sites on the genome. We solve the crystal structure of UBP alone and in complex with ucm DNA, and further show that UBP interacts with the MCM replicative helicase. Taken together, our data provide evidence that UBP functions as a general nucleoid-associated protein that plays a key role in facilitating the egress of the MCM replicative helicase from DNA replication origins.","DNA replication typically has defined start sites, or replication origins, which are designated by their recognition by specific initiator proteins. In addition to initiators, general chromatin or nucleoid-associated proteins have been shown to play roles in modulating origin efficiency in eukaryotes and bacteria. The role of chromatin proteins in origin function in the archaeal domain of life is poorly understood. Here, we describe a dissection of sequences elements required for in vivo function of an archaeal DNA replication origin. Our data reveal a hitherto uncharacterized sequence element, the ucm, is required for origin activity. We identify a protein, UBP, that interacts with the ucm and additionally with hundreds of other sites on the genome.

Adapting to a suspension culture would overcome this restriction and reduce production costs. First, a Vero suspension isolate was obtained and metabolically characterized. Second, RNA sequencing analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes between adherent and suspension cells, which revealed complete downregulation of adhesion and matrix-associated genes. Additionally, signaling pathways involving Wnt and other tyrosine kinase receptors were identified as potential leads for growth optimization. In particular, supplementation with fibroblast growth factor 2 allowed for a 20% increase in cell density. Finally, a comparative viral productivity assay revealed a 30% increase in poliovirus production in suspension Vero cells compared to adherent cells depending on the serotype, as well as a 140% increase in respiratory syncytial virus production and a 150% increase in yellow fever virus production. This work establishes the potential of the suspension Vero cell line as a new cell platform for viral vaccine production.","Vero cells, as approved by the World Health Organization, have been the most commonly used continuous cell line for viral vaccine production over the last 25 years, but their adherent phenotype continues to limit productivity.

We previously reported that post-HCT immunotherapy with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific donor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells engineered to express a Wilms Tumor Antigen 1-specific T-cell receptor (T<sub>TCR-C4</sub>) appeared to prevent relapse in high-risk patients. In this phase I/II clinical trial (NCT01640301), we evaluated safety (primary endpoint), persistence and efficacy (secondary endpoints) of EBV- or Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T<sub>TCR-C4</sub> in fifteen patients with active AML post-HCT. Infusions were well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities or serious adverse events related to the product. However, T<sub>TCR-C4</sub> cells did not clearly improve outcomes despite EBV-specific T<sub>TCR-C4</sub> cells showing enhanced potential for prolonged persistence compared to CMV-specific T<sub>TCR-C4</sub>. Investigating the fate of persisting T<sub>TCR-C4</sub>, we identified a shift towards natural killer-like (NKL) terminal differentiation, distinct from solid tumor-associated canonical exhaustion programs. In one patient, treatment with azacitidine appeared to mitigate this NKL skewing, promoting T<sub>TCR-C4</sub> persistence. These findings suggest that AML drives a distinct form of T-cell dysfunction, highlight the need for targeted approaches that preserve T-cell fitness, ultimately improving the efficacy of cellular therapies for AML.","Relapsed and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post-allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is usually fatal.

We sought to understand the pathogenic role of microenvironmental interactions and the extracellular matrix in post-mortem COVID-19 lung using an integrative multi-omic approach. Post-mortem formalin fixed paraffin embedded lung tissue from fatal COVID-19 and non-respiratory death control lung underwent multi-omic evaluation by Quantseq Bulk RNA sequencing, Nanostring GeoMX spatial transcriptomics, RNAscope, multiplex immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, to evaluate virus distribution, immune composition and the extracellular matrix. Markers of extracellular synthesis and breakdown were measured in the serum of 215 patients with COVID-19 and 54 healthy volunteer controls by ELISA. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was restricted to the pneumocytes and macrophages of early-stage disease. Spatial analyses revealed an immunosuppressive virus microenvironment, enriched for PDL1+IDO1+ macrophages and depleted of T-cells. Oligoclonal T-cells in COVID-19 lung showed no enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell receptors. Collagen VI was upregulated and contributed to alveolar wall thickening and impaired gas exchange in COVID-19 lung. Serum from COVID-19 patients showed increased levels of PRO-C6, a marker of collagen VI synthesis, predicted mortality in hospitalized patients. Our data refine the current model of respiratory COVID-19 with regard to virus distribution, immune niches, and the role of the non-cellular microenvironment in pathogenesis and risk stratification in COVID-19.

Mechanistically, biochar alleviated PSMP-induced inhibition of organic conversion and acid accumulation through metabolic pathway enhancement. Biochar enhanced methanogenesis by facilitating direct interspecies electron transfer and enriching diverse methanogenic archaea, thereby promoting metabolic pathway diversification.

OXA-48 carbapenemase is one of the notorious enzymes that inactivates carbapenems through hydrolysis. The emergence of OXA-48 and OXA-48-like carbapenemases is a significant concern as they are responsible for many outbreaks of hospital-acquired infections in various countries, with limited treatment options available. Thus, targeting this enzyme and inhibiting its activity can be an attractive therapeutic strategy. In this study, a rational computer-aided approach was applied to design effective inhibitory peptides against OXA-48 carbapenemase. The primary library was constructed based on peptides derived from the Human Antimicrobial Peptide (HAMP) database. The binding of peptides to the enzyme was investigated through molecular docking studies using ClusPro. After each screening step, numerous targeted amino acid substitutions were performed to enhance the affinity and physicochemical properties of the selected peptides. The final selected peptides, in complex with the enzyme, were subjected to 200 ns Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations using the GROMACS package, and MM/PBSA analysis was conducted to evaluate the binding free energy of the enzyme-peptide complexes. Finally, the inhibitory effects of the designed peptides were also computationally assessed on OXA-48-like carbapenemases. Homology modeling was used to generate 3D structures of the enzymes whose structures were not solved experimentally. Results indicated that the two final selected peptides effectively interacted with the important residues of OXA-48 carbapenemase and spatially blocked its active site. These peptides also demonstrated high binding affinity to the most common OXA-48-like carbapenemases in silico.

In vitro studies on the efficacy of one of the designed peptides, M104, demonstrated that this peptide enhanced the activity of meropenem against a meropenem-resistant, clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae strain harboring the gene bla<sub>OXA48</sub> by reducing its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by 4-fold. In an era where effective inhibitors against OXA-48 carbapenemase are limited, present study addressed this urgent need by rationally designed novel peptides.",PubMed

Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a pleiotropic factor that can be induced by influenza infection and is closely associated with the development of pneumonia. However, the specific viral protein responsible for regulating IL-10 production during IAV infection, as well as its detailed mechanisms involved, remains incompletely understood. In this study, we screened the IAV genes and found that IAV Non-structural protein 1(NS1) upregulates the production of IL-10 through the PI3K-AKT pathway. Moreover, we found that NS1 interacted with PI3K p85β subunit, leading to the activation of PI3K-AKT. This subsequently inhibits GSK3β, thereby promoting the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of CREB, and ultimately inducing the expression of IL-10. Furthermore, IAV-infected A549-derived exosomes carrying NS1 promoted IL-10 by the same pathway. Together, these results suggest that IAV increased IL-10 expression through multiple pathways, including direct action of NS1 or through exosomes. Our findings provide novel insights into additional functionalities of IAV NS1 during infection.","Influenza A virus (IAV) has a potential pandemic threat and is a major challenge to human health.

10.1016/j.micpath.2025.107784,Effect of Ichthyophthirius multifiliis infection on host immunity and microbiota shifts of Takifugu fasciatus.,"Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Ich) is a major pathogen responsible for high mortality rates in Takifugu fasciatus aquaculture. Despite its significance, the local and systemic immune responses of pufferfish to Ich infection remain poorly understood. Additionally, the interaction between ectoparasite infection and gut microbiota has not been thoroughly investigated. To address these gaps, we established an Ich infection model in pufferfish through bath administration. RT-PCR confirmed that Ich invades the skin, gill, and fin at 10 days post-infection (dpi) using 5000 theronts per fish. RT-qPCR analysis revealed immune responses in the spleen, liver, gill, skin, and gut following infection, while H&E staining identified Ich intrusion into the epidermal layer of the skin. RNA-seq analysis showed that pathways such as Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, legionellosis, and Chagas disease were significantly enriched in the spleen, whereas ECM-receptor interaction, calcium signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways were enriched in the skin, suggesting that Ich breaches local defenses and activates systemic immune responses. Furthermore, Ich infection reduced the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota, with notable compositional shifts, including a decrease in commensals such as Chryseobacterium and an increase in opportunistic bacteria like Elizabethkingia. These findings enhance our understanding of the intricate interactions between parasite, host, and gut microbiota, providing insights into the immune and microbiome dynamics of Ich infection in pufferfish.","Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Ich) is a major pathogen responsible for high mortality rates in Takifugu fasciatus aquaculture.

10.1016/j.micpath.2025.107773,Exploring the insecticidal and antimalarial potentials of Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin: A promising alternative for integrated malaria control.,"Malaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum, remains a significant global health challenge, necessitating the development of new, effective control strategies. Similarly, Anopheles funestus mosquitoes, major vectors for malaria transmission, require sustainable insecticidal control measures. Thus, this study explores, the combined insecticidal and antimalarial potential of Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin, highlighting its promise for integrated vector and parasite control. The larvicidal activity of azurin was evaluated against Anopheles funestus larvae, with mortality rates assessed following exposure to varying azurin concentrations. Biochemical assays measured the effects on carbohydrate, protein, lipid levels, and enzyme activities in larvae. Additionally, the antimalarial activity of azurin was tested on two Plasmodium falciparum strains through dose-response curves to determine IC50 values. Azurin demonstrated potent larvicidal activity with lower IC50 and IC90 values (0.070 and 1.907 μg/mL respectively) compared to temephos. Biochemical analysis revealed significant reductions in total carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in azurin-treated larvae, indicating metabolic disruption. Enzyme activity assays showed significant decreases in protease, invertase, and acetylcholinesterase activities, further confirming the insecticidal effects. Moreover, azurin exhibited strong antiparasitic activity against P. falciparum, with the lowest IC50 compared to chloroquine and pyrimethamine, especially against drug-resistant strains. Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin displays significant larvicidal and antimalarial activities, making it a promising candidate for integrated vector and parasite control strategies. Its ability to disrupt both mosquito metabolism and Plasmodium functions highlights its potential as an environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic insecticides and antimalarials.","Malaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum, remains a significant global health challenge, necessitating the development of new, effective control strategies.

10.1016/j.plantsci.2025.112590,A 13-bp insertion in CmAPRR2 gene disrupts its function in regulating the green rind formation of immature melon fruit (Cucumis melo L.).,"Melon (Cucumis melo L.) fruit rind color represents a crucial agronomic trait that significantly influences consumer preference, market value, and postharvest quality. Although economically important, the molecular mechanisms regulating rind color variation remain largely unexplored. In this study, we identified and characterized a key gene controlling the immature fruit rind color from two melon inbred lines, TC3 with immature green fruit rind and Tm34 with immature light-green fruit rind. Genetic segregation analysis across multiple populations demonstrated that immature green fruit rind color is governed by a single completely dominant gene, designated as GR. Fine mapping strategies delimited the GR locus to a 27.14 kb region on chromosome 4 containing five candidate genes. Sequence analysis revealed a 13-bp insertion specifically within the seventh exon of CmAPRR2, encoding a two-component response regulator-like protein APRR2. The insertion introduced a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. Allelic diversity assessment among 40 natural melon accessions revealed a strong correlation between rind color phenotype and the CmAPRR2 insertion polymorphism. Expression analysis demonstrated significantly higher CmAPRR2 transcript levels in green rinds compared to light-green rinds during immature fruit development. Consistent with this observation, genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis and chloroplast development were also upregulated in green rinds. While the insertion mutation did not affect the nuclear localization of CmAPRR2, it exhibited a significant reduction in its transcriptional activation capacity. Further, employing virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to silence the SlAPRR2 gene in tomato led to the development of light-green fruit coloration and a marked downregulation of APRR2 gene expression. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying melon rind color formation and identify CmAPRR2 as a promising genetic resource for molecular breeding programs aimed at manipulating rind color traits in melon.","Melon (Cucumis melo L.) fruit rind color represents a crucial agronomic trait that significantly influences consumer preference, market value, and postharvest quality.

This is mainly due to the high regression rates of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and the observed increased risk associated with excisional treatment. Women with a previous history of excisional treatment for cervical precancer are at increased risk of subsequent anogenital cancer and precancer. For a full assessment of benefits and harms of active surveillance for CIN2, we investigated the risk of non-cervical anogenital cancers and precancers in women undergoing active surveillance. We aimed to investigate whether women undergoing active surveillance for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 are at increased risk of vulva, vaginal, or anal cancer and precancer compared to women treated with loop electrosurgical excision procedure. We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study in Denmark. We included all female residents diagnosed with incident cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 at age 18-40 during 1998-2020. The primary outcome was vulva, vaginal, or anal cancer or precancer. We stratified by age at CIN2 diagnosis (<30 years, ≥30 years), calendar year (1998-2012, 2013-2020), and index cytology (non-high-grade, high-grade). As secondary outcome, we considered low-grade lesions of the vulva, vagina, and anus. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of the outcomes with loop electrosurgical excision procedure as the reference group. We used inverse probability treatment weighting to calculate adjusted HR (aHR), considering age, calendar year, and index cytology as confounders. Overall, 27,505 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 were included; 12,507 (45.5%) underwent active surveillance, and 14,998 (54.5%) underwent loop electrosurgical excision procedure. A total of 162 women had a subsequent diagnosis of vulva, vaginal, or anal cancer or precancer. The cumulative risk after 10 years was 0.5% (95% CI (0.3-0.6)). We found no difference in risk between women undergoing active surveillance and those having a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (aHR=1.00 (95% CI 0.71-1.40)). Similar findings were observed when stratifying by age, year of diagnosis, and index cytology. We found that the risk of low-grade lesions of the vulva, vagina, and anus was lower in women undergoing active surveillance than in women treated with LEEP (aHR=0.75 (0.62-0.91). Active surveillance for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 is not associated with an increased risk of non-cervical anogenital cancer and precancer compared to loop electrosurgical excision procedure.

With the widespread adoption of vaccination in children, the incidence among older individuals has increased substantially. Despite this epidemiological shift, research on JEV infection in the elderly remains limited. We established JEV infection models using both aged and young mice to explore age-related differences in pathology and underlying mechanisms. Brain tissue samples were analyzed for pathological changes and viral tropism in major cell types. To further characterize immune response variations, we conducted transcriptomic sequencing on the brain tissues following JEV infection. Aged mice exhibited lower mortality, delayed disease progression, and milder brain pathology compared to young mice after JEV infection. Viral titers and infection rates of major brain cell types were similar in both groups. Transcriptomic analysis revealed diminished immune activation and weaker inflammatory responses in aged mice. Additionally, microglial activation and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function were significantly reduced. Interestingly, JEV infection induced the selective recruitment of B cells in the brains of aged mice. These B cells may modulate the effects of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the disease process. Compared to young mice, aged mice showed enhanced resistance to JEV progression and reduced brain pathology. This resistance was associated with a weakened immune response in the aged brain, rather than differences in viral infection.

In this study, dairy products were collected and After isolation and identification of Bifidobacterium via PCR method, the cytotoxicity effects of cell free supernatants (CFS) (B.Bifidum S2 and B.Bifidum S3) and bacterial cell extract (B.Bifidum P6 and B.Bifidum P17) on colon cancer cell line (SW948) and normal cell line (HEK-293) were evaluated using MTT assay. The effect of isolated bacterial strains on apoptotic cells was determined by measuring caspases 1, 3, 9 and Bax by using ELISA kit. The results showed that the cytotoxicity effect of CFS was higher than bacterial cell extract. CFS showed the highest cytotoxicity effect (about 95%) on colon cancer cell line. Quantitative analysis of Caspase-1, -3, 9, and Bax expression demonstrated that CFS may exert anticancer effects through induced apoptosis. The results of the present research indicate that probably B.Bifidum S2 and B.Bifidum S3 isolates may be prevent colon cancer by inducing apoptosis.","Nowadays, probiotic bacteria have been considered as a factor in the prevention and treatment of cancer, especially by induction of apoptosis.

In this study, dairy products were collected and After isolation and identification of Bifidobacterium via PCR method, the cytotoxicity effects of cell free supernatants (CFS) (B.Bifidum S2 and B.Bifidum S3) and bacterial cell extract (B.Bifidum P6 and B.Bifidum P17) on colon cancer cell line (SW948) and normal cell line (HEK-293) were evaluated using MTT assay. The effect of isolated bacterial strains on apoptotic cells was determined by measuring caspases 1, 3, 9 and Bax by using ELISA kit. The results showed that the cytotoxicity effect of CFS was higher than bacterial cell extract. CFS showed the highest cytotoxicity effect (about 95%) on colon cancer cell line. Quantitative analysis of Caspase-1, -3, 9, and Bax expression demonstrated that CFS may exert anticancer effects through induced apoptosis. The results of the present research indicate that probably B.Bifidum S2 and B.Bifidum S3 isolates may be prevent colon cancer by inducing apoptosis.",PubMed

HBV produces an X protein (HBx) that is heavily linked to HCC, a similar finding seen across the Orthohepadnaviruses. There is an analogous, but truncated form of the X protein in Avihepadnaviruses, but no HCC is seen in infected avian species. This raises questions about the differences between mammalian and avian X proteins and their potential roles in carcinogenesis. Here we explore this question from a structural perspective of X proteins across mammalian and avian hepadnaviruses to determine whether there are any structural features linking these interesting observations. We first compile sequences to create consensus sequences with which to align with each other and subsequently to input into modeling programs, RoseTTAFold (RF) and AlphaFold3 (AF3). Comparative analyses show that mammalian X proteins are longer (154aa and 141aa, respectively for HBx and WHx) and have distinct domains in their C-terminal region, including a BH3-like domain that has been linked with many cancer pathways. Avian X proteins, however, are truncated with a similarly located stop codon. This truncation rids the protein of the BH3-like domain. We sought to find this domain by theoretical read-through or frameshifts and indeed, an analogous BH3-like domain is found that can similarly bind the BH3 target Bcl-2. Based on this work, it may be evolutionarily plausible that a single-nucleotide insertion led to the stop codon and BH3-domain loss that may account for the lack of cancers seen with Avihepadnaviruses.","Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

However, the functions of Ran in grouper and their effects on the viral infections are still unclear. In this study, we identified and characterized Ran in Epinephelus coioides (EcRan). EcRan encodes a 215 amino acid polypeptide containing key conserved domains including G1-G5 box and C terminal domains. EcRan was widely expressed in different tissues of healthy groupers, and showed obvious nucleus localization. Upon infection of Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) or red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), EcRan transcript was significantly decreased. Moreover, overexpression of EcRan remarkably inhibited the replication of SGIV and RGNNV, whereas knockdown of EcRan notably promoted the replication of SGIV and RGNNV. In addition, overexpressed EcRan positively regulated the transcription of interferon (IFN)-related and inflammatory factors, including IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), myxovirus resistance gene 1 (MXI), laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8). The transcription of these immune genes was down regulated when EcRan transcription was inhibited by siRNA. Taken together, EcRan showed the antiviral effects against SGIV and RGNNV infections by positively regulating innate immune response.","Ran is a small G-protein that acts as a ""molecular switch"" in nucleoplasmic transport regulating cellular activities.

The high mutation and recombination rate of the virus, the establishment of a viral reservoir early in infection, and the failure to mount an effective immune response have added to the complexities of vaccine development. In this review, we tried to revisit the vaccine development efforts, categorize the immunogens based on the immune response they tried to elicit and discuss the limited success or failure they achieved so far. The initial efforts of vaccine development concentrated on a three-pronged approach, induction of neutralizing antibodies, induction of cell-mediated immunity, or a combination of the two. Since then, the efforts to develop an effective immunogen have come a long way through the usage of poxviral vectors, conserved immunogens, and mosaic immunogens to the current trend of using mRNA-based vaccines, engineered outer domains on scaffold proteins and the development of germline targeting immunogens for induction of broadly neutralizing antibody-producing B-cell lineage. We also tried to narrate the current trends and the future directions of HIV vaccine development.","The path of HIV vaccine development is riddled with numerous challenges.

Their RNA viruses may also reflect this transitional state, but this has not been tested. In particular, it is not known whether tunicate RNA viruses form a sister group to those found in vertebrates, indicative of virus-host co-divergence throughout the entire evolutionary history of the chordates. To address this key question in RNA virus evolution, we analyzed primary and publicly available RNA libraries to identify tunicate-associated RNA viruses and determine their phylogenetic relationships. Although the majority of the tunicate viruses identified were most closely related to those found in invertebrates or were not animal associated, others shared common ancestry with vertebrate influenza viruses, alphaviruses, and mononegaviruses, thereby extending the evolutionary timescales of these groups. We also showed that the recombination of glycoproteins between different orders of RNA viruses, including between positive- and negative-sense viruses, may have shaped the evolution of multiple lineages. Overall, our study reveals that some disease-causing RNA virus lineages have ancestries that date to the early chordates and highlights that the evolution of structural genes may be incongruent with that of the highly conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.","Tunicates are a key transitional taxon in animal evolution as the closest extant invertebrate relatives of the vertebrates.

Often these interactions are mediated via chemical signals, and the role of physical factors is overlooked. In this study, we probe into the spreading characteristics of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a flagellated bacteria in moisture-limited conditions and in the presence of immotile yeast colonies of Cryptococcus neoformans-a duo commonly known to cohabitate in nature. We find that bacteria spread faster in the presence of yeast, caused by the enhanced motility of bacterial cells in the vicinity of the yeast microcolonies. This enhancement is not a result of chemical signaling but due to the formation of a fluid layer around the yeast cells, which locally allows the flagellated bacteria to swim. Proliferation of yeast changes this fluid landscape around it and leads to the dynamic spread of bacteria. Factors such as the growth rate ratios and the seeding composition of the microorganisms determine the optimal spread of the bacteria. Physical factors such as these may have a crucial role in the dynamics of polymicrobial communities in various ecological environments.","The survival of microorganisms crucially depends on the nature of their interactions with other cohabiting microorganisms.

Despite their pivotal role in nitrogen cycling, the diversity and niche specialization of AOPs in marine sediments are poorly resolved. In this study, high-throughput amplicon analysis of the amoA gene was employed to investigate the diversity, community structure and distribution of AOPs in surface sediments of the South China Sea (SCS). Phylogenetic analysis showed that 91% of the OTUs were not affiliated with any known AOPs, suggesting putative novel AOPs existed in the marine sediments. Only 2 OTUs of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) belonged to known Nitrosospelagicusa and Nitrosopumilus, and the other 15 dominant OTUs were identified as novel AOA. All 6 dominant OTUs of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria were identified as novel clusters. PCoA revealed significant segregation of AOP communities between shallow and deep-sea sediments. Pearson correlation analysis further demonstrated temperature and depth as key factors driving niche differentiation of AOPs. Overall, this study firstly reported novel AOPs in marine sediments and provided comprehensive information on their distribution and ecological significance in shallow and deep-sea sediments.","Ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes (AOPs) are key drivers of nitrification in the ecosystem.

However, limited data availability has hindered our understanding of the relationship between climate, social conditions, and plague. Here we address a critical data gap by collecting and digitizing county-level plague grade data from China during 1754-1949 together with socio-climatic factors. Our high spatiotemporal resolution statistical analyses unraveled the complex dynamics shaped by climate and social factors. Both excessive and insufficient precipitation heightened plague risks, with dryness in the previous year posing a greater risk, showing regional variations. Specifically, in northern China, each additional level of dryness from the previous year results in an excess risk of 28.4% (95%CI: 11.3%-48.2%), surpassing the 6.9% (95%CI: -0.2%-14.5%) increase observed in southern China. Notably, during social anomalies like famines and migrations, dryness increased plague outbreak risk, not wetness. This may be attributed to these socially anomalous events closely associated with dryness, which weaken the human immune system and intensify human-wildlife interactions. These findings provide insights into plague outbreak mechanisms from a climate-social co-action perspective and highlight the importance of elucidating the complex relationship between climate and social factors in century-scale infectious disease research.","Plague, a disease influenced by climatic and social factors, has historically caused devastating disasters in China.

Serological surveys offer a comprehensive view of population-level immune response to SARS-CoV-2 post- infection and/or vaccination. Here, we performed a serial cross-sectional study from residual serum samples collected from pregnant individuals in British Columbia during their first trimester antenatal screening. A total of 28,050 samples were collected between November 2021 and March 2024. We tracked changes in antibody levels over time and examined differences in antibody responses based on age and vaccination status during different phases of the pandemic. Antenatal serum samples enabled tracking of SARS-CoV-2 serostatus within the population and waves of major SARS-CoV-2 infections, such as the Omicron surge in 2021-2022 and increases in infection during the 2023-2024 respiratory season. During the 2023-2024 season, we observed a significant rise in Nucleocapsid (N) seropositivity compared to the previous year, reaching 64.3 % in the vaccinated group and 67.05 % in the unvaccinated group. This suggests a high infection rate, likely driven by the latest Omicron variants. Additionally, we differentiated between infection-induced and vaccine-induced seroprevalence. By March 2024, Spike (S) seroprevalence was 94 % in the unvaccinated group and 100 % in the vaccinated group. We assessed the longevity of vaccine-induced antibody within the population. A significant negative correlation was observed between S seropositivity (indicative of vaccination without infection, S+/N-) and time since the last vaccine dose. In contrast, anti-N levels began to rise above the cut-off value of seropositivity 15 months post-vaccination, indicating increased infection rates and N seroprevalence as time post-vaccination increased.

10.1016/j.ijpddr.2025.100600,Global equine parasite control guidelines: Consensus or confusion?,"Equine parasite control has historically been characterized by confusing and conflicting information, posing significant challenges for veterinarians and horse owners to make evidence-based decisions. Since 2012, equine parasite control guidelines have been developed and published for different parts of the world to address this situation and provide trusted sources of current guidance. At the 2024 International Equine Infectious Disease Conference in Deauville, Normandy, France, lead authors of equine parasite control guideline documents published in the USA, UK, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, and Europe convened and presented their guidelines. This led to a discussion of differences and similarities between the guidelines and an effort to identify current research needs in this area. In general, all guidelines recommend a surveillance-based approach for equine parasite control, emphasizing the importance of anthelmintic resistance testing. Some guidelines have a focus on controlling Strongylus vulgaris, while others primarily focus on cyathostomins, ascarids and tapeworms. Although the same four anthelmintic drug classes are marketed in most countries, there are some differences between product portfolios available, most notably between Australia and other countries. European countries have various degrees of prescription-only restrictions on anthelmintic products, whereas products are available over the counter in Australia and the USA. Commercially available diagnostic portfolios differed somewhat between countries and affected recommendations made as well. In conclusion, the guidelines are in general agreement and are based on the same general principles. One major challenge is communicating the recommendations effectively to end-users, which should be made a priority going forward.","Equine parasite control has historically been characterized by confusing and conflicting information, posing significant challenges for veterinarians and horse owners to make evidence-based decisions. Since 2012, equine parasite control guidelines have been developed and published for different parts of the world to address this situation and provide trusted sources of current guidance. At the 2024 International Equine Infectious Disease Conference in Deauville, Normandy, France, lead authors of equine parasite control guideline documents published in the USA, UK, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, and Europe convened and presented their guidelines. This led to a discussion of differences and similarities between the guidelines and an effort to identify current research needs in this area. In general, all guidelines recommend a surveillance-based approach for equine parasite control, emphasizing the importance of anthelmintic resistance testing. Some guidelines have a focus on controlling Strongylus vulgaris, while others primarily focus on cyathostomins, ascarids and tapeworms. Although the same four anthelmintic drug classes are marketed in most countries, there are some differences between product portfolios available, most notably between Australia and other countries. European countries have various degrees of prescription-only restrictions on anthelmintic products, whereas products are available over the counter in Australia and the USA. Commercially available diagnostic portfolios differed somewhat between countries and affected recommendations made as well. In conclusion, the guidelines are in general agreement and are based on the same general principles. One major challenge is communicating the recommendations effectively to end-users, which should be made a priority going forward.",PubMed
10.1016/j.micres.2025.128255,Unraveling the pathogenetic overlap of Helicobacter pylori and metabolic syndrome-related Porphyromonas gingivalis: Gingipains at the crossroads and as common denominator.,"Chronic bacterial infections exert profound systemic effects beyond their primary infection sites, influencing a range of inflammatory, metabolic, and neurodegenerative diseases. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) are two highly prevalent pathogens that, despite occupying distinct niches, share remarkable pathogenic similarities. Both bacteria, connected with metabolic syndrome, employ immune evasion strategies, induce chronic inflammation, and contribute to systemic diseases such as metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease. A key unifying factor in their pathogenicity is the role of gingipains-cysteine proteases produced by Pg-which facilitate bacterial invasion, immune modulation, and tissue destruction. Emerging evidence suggests that Hp possesses analogous proteolytic enzymes, further supporting their potential synergistic impact on host health. Moreover, both pathogens have been implicated in metabolic syndrome-related blood-brain barrier disruption, chronic (smoldering) systemic inflammation, and lipid metabolism dysregulation, contributing to progressive neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disorders. The role of galectins, particularly galectin-3, in modulating microglial activation and inflammatory pathways further highlights their involvement in neuroinflammatory diseases. Targeting gingipains presents a promising therapeutic avenue, with bismuth compounds and novel inhibitors showing potential in disrupting these proteases and mitigating their systemic effects. Understanding the interactions between Hp and metabolic syndrome-related Pg is crucial for developing comprehensive treatment strategies, integrating gastroenterology, periodontology, and neurology. Addressing these infections at both local and systemic levels may improve long-term health outcomes and reduce the burden of chronic inflammatory diseases linked to microbial persistence.","Chronic bacterial infections exert profound systemic effects beyond their primary infection sites, influencing a range of inflammatory, metabolic, and neurodegenerative diseases.

The purpose of this study is to explore how dietary changes in infancy influence gut microbiota composition and diversity. A scoping review was conducted using databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid Medline, Science Direct, and ProQuest. English-language studies published between 2003 and 2023 were included if they focused on mothers and caregivers with children aged 0 to 23 months involved in Infant and Young Child Feeding practices. A total of 561 studies were identified, with 15 articles included for data extraction. Significant differences in gut microbiota diversity related to feeding practices were observed. Infants who were exclusively breastfeding (EBF) exhibited lower phylogenetic diversity (5.8 ± 1.3, P < 0.05) compared to non-EBF infants (6.4 ± 1.8, P < 0.05). The EBF infants showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels of beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, while non-EBF infants had elevated levels of potentially pathogenic genera, including Bacteroides and Clostridium. Additionally, earlier introduction of complementary foods was associated with increased alpha diversity (mean difference = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.55), and dietary factors such as total energy intake, carbohydrate, and fiber significantly correlated with gut microbial diversity (P < 0.05). These results imply that the type of feeding, timing of introduction, and type of food intake during complementary feeding have a significant impact on the infant's gut microbiota diversity and composition. Future research could explore the long-term implications of these early dietary exposures on metabolic function and immune system health.","Infants experience significant changes in gut microbiota during the first year of life as they transition from exclusive milk consumption to solid foods.

The connection of watersheds throughout Europe by the construction of artificial shipping canals has created novel invasion pathways, but may also provide critical infrastructure to counter range expansion by implementation of different barrier solutions. Here, we critically review the efficacy, applicability and limitations of dispersal barriers against AIS in shipping canals considering fishes, invertebrates, algae, bacteria and fungi. Despite the wide spread of AIS and their known detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems, research focusing on barriers for AIS in shipping canals is rather limited and predominantly concentrated on a few species of fish. Out of 180 screened studies, only 32 examined the efficacy of technologies such as electric fields, acoustic signals, strobe light, air-bubble curtains, CO<sub>2</sub> and pheromones as non-physical barriers. Efficacy and applicability was mostly tested in laboratory setups and strongly species-dependent, requiring a site-specific identification of the most useful barrier technology. Major limitations to barrier implementation include undesired and unknown side effects on non-target species, humans and the environment. To preserve the ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems across transboundary and inland watersheds, future research should tackle these challenges by increasing the number of studies under realistic field conditions to allow evidence-based decision making on the management of AIS.","The spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS) presents a pressing challenge for global biodiversity, with freshwater ecosystems being particularly affected.

Azole drugs are the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. However, because azole drugs can easily interact with human CYPs metabolic enzymes, the risk of drug-to-drug interaction is high when multiple drugs are used together with azole drugs in clinic. As the problem of fungal drug resistance is becoming increasingly serious, there is an urgent need to develop new CYP51 inhibitors. The successful marketing of Oteseconazole has brought the development of azole drugs into a new era. Compound A33, previously discovered by our group, showed excellent antifungal activity against a variety of pathogenic and drug-resistant fungi. Nevertheless, owing to its structural characteristics, it showed poor selectivity for the human CYPs family and extremely poor metabolic stability. To address the above problem, inspired by the reduced CYP inhibition observed in Oteseconazole, we replaced its triazole group with tetrazole and attempted deuteration strategies and carbonyl introduction to block the metabolic site. This modification led to the synthesis of compounds V01-V24, in which V23 showed broad-spectrum activity and resistance characteristics, especially against Aspergillus fumigatum (MIC<sub>80</sub> = 1 μg/mL), which had no inhibitory activity for many azole drugs. Compared to A33, the introduction of the tetrazole structure reduced its inhibitory activity against the human CYPs family. Furthermore, V23 could prevent fungal phase transformation and biofilm formation, resulting in satisfactory fungicidal activity. V23 showed negligible toxicity toward SH-SY5Y and HUVEC cells, and in vivo pharmacodynamic studies have shown that V23 has significant in vivo antifungal activity. In conclusion, the discovery of compound V23 is a successful exploration of a new tetrazole CYP51 inhibitor for the treatment of invasive fungal infections.","Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a serious infectious disease worldwide, characterized by high mortality and morbidity.

Meanwhile, the antibiotic pipeline is dominated by incremental variations on compounds already in clinical use. There is thus a pressing need to explore novel therapeutic strategies with lower likelihood of resistance development. One such promising target is FabV, an enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (ENR). These enzymes represent a crucial component of the universal bacterial fatty acid biosynthetic pathway (FasII), that is found across several critical Gram-negative bacteria. This includes P. aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen associated with hospital infections. This pathogen co-expresses FabV with its more common isozyme FabI, rendering it resistant to existing FabI inhibitors. This study aimed to investigate the rational, iterative design of P. aeruginosa FabV (paFabV) inhibitors. A total of 59 compounds, based on the previously established diaryl ether scaffold for ENR inhibition, were synthesized and screened in an NADH absorbance-based enzymatic assay. These efforts resulted in identifying para-benzenesulfonamides as privileged motifs and establishing the ideal length of the alkyl chain substituent to be five or six carbon atoms. Molecular modelling simulations indicate that the increase in potency is due to the sulfonamide group being able to engage in hydrogen bonding with Ser155, a highly conserved residue across FabV isoforms from various bacterial species. The findings reported herein provide a promising foundation for further exploration of the therapeutic potential of FabV inhibition.","The uncontrolled rise and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a critical and immediate threat to global health, responsible for millions of deaths annually, with current trends indicating that the global burden of disease is poised to increase dramatically in the coming decades.

This study is the first to quantitatively compare AMR data from a UADL and a commercial diagnostic laboratory *CDL) by analyzing antimicrobial susceptibility testing *AST) results for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius in cats and dogs from New York State between 2019 and 2022. The analysis focused on first-line and higher-tier antimicrobials and revealed a tendency for the UADL data to observe lower susceptibility rates than the CDL. However, the extent of this difference varied by bacteria-antimicrobial combination, geographic region, and time. A secondary objective was to develop and test a novel Shiny application designed to harmonize and prepare data for comparison without exchanging raw data, addressing several data-sharing concerns that could limit collaboration. These findings highlight how variations in data sources can affect resistance estimates and interpretations. By identifying similarities and differences, this study underscores the importance of considering data source characteristics when analyzing and applying AMR surveillance reports. Integrating data from multiple sources may provide a more balanced and representative understanding of resistance patterns, thereby supporting more effective surveillance and decision-making in companion animal medicine. Here, we demonstrate that user-friendly analysis tools can support data integration without requiring raw data to be publicly available or shared between institutions.","Antimicrobial resistance *AMR) presents significant challenges in veterinary medicine, necessitating accurate surveillance to inform effective mitigation strategies. Most resistance estimates for cats and dogs are based on a single data source, typically university-affiliated diagnostic laboratories *UADLs), which may limit their generalizability. This study is the first to quantitatively compare AMR data from a UADL and a commercial diagnostic laboratory *CDL) by analyzing antimicrobial susceptibility testing *AST) results for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius in cats and dogs from New York State between 2019 and 2022. The analysis focused on first-line and higher-tier antimicrobials and revealed a tendency for the UADL data to observe lower susceptibility rates than the CDL. However, the extent of this difference varied by bacteria-antimicrobial combination, geographic region, and time. A secondary objective was to develop and test a novel Shiny application designed to harmonize and prepare data for comparison without exchanging raw data, addressing several data-sharing concerns that could limit collaboration. These findings highlight how variations in data sources can affect resistance estimates and interpretations. By identifying similarities and differences, this study underscores the importance of considering data source characteristics when analyzing and applying AMR surveillance reports. Integrating data from multiple sources may provide a more balanced and representative understanding of resistance patterns, thereby supporting more effective surveillance and decision-making in companion animal medicine. Here, we demonstrate that user-friendly analysis tools can support data integration without requiring raw data to be publicly available or shared between institutions.",PubMed

The findings indicated that SRB and MA exhibited a synergistic effect on the corrosion process. This resulted in a significant increase in corrosion weight loss in the SRB + MA group (16.05 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), which was 8.64 times that of the SRB group (1.86 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) and 1.58 times that of the MA group (10.14 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>). This synergistic effect can be attributed to the influence of SRB and MA on the formation of corrosion products, producing more corrosion products such as FeS in the mixed group. In addition, the corrosion of carbon steel is further enhanced by electron transfer process between carbon steel and microorganisms in the mixed group.","The impact of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and methanogenic archaea (MA) on the corrosion of carbon steel was examined through weight loss tests, electrochemical measurements, surface analyses, and metagenomic analyses.

The adaptation of deep-sea microbial communities to diverse environmental conditions, particularly the effects of temperature on biofilm formation and MFC efficiency in high-salinity environments, remains under-explored. This study aims to fill this gap by examining how different temperatures (4 °C (F35), 25 °C (R35), and 37 °C (I35)) affect anodic biofilm formation and MFC performance. The research employs deep-sea sediment inoculum from the South China Sea to enhance understanding of microbial adaptability and optimize performance in extreme conditions. Among the tested conditions, I35 demonstrated the highest current and power densities at 172.49 mA/m<sup>2</sup> and 20.09 mW/m<sup>2</sup>, representing increases of approximately 129 % and 350 % compared to F35. R35 displayed moderate output. Microbial analysis revealed that I35 had the highest CFU count at 7.67 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mL, with Gram staining and colony morphology indicating greater diversity and a higher abundance of electroactive Gram-negative populations at elevated temperatures. Performance improved with increased temperature; however, the power gains were more significant than variations in microbial counts, underscoring the importance of microbial composition, biofilm conductivity, and electron transfer efficiency. Despite having viable bacteria, F35 showed low output due to a less electroactive community and considerable charge transfer resistance. These findings highlight the need to enhance microbial quality, not just quantity, to improve MFC performance in extreme conditions and support the future application of thermally adapted biofilms in high-salinity MFC systems.","Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) generate electricity by converting organic materials and utilizing electroactive bacteria, where anodic biofilms play a vital role in electron transfer and controlling internal resistance.

Chicken infectious anemia virus (CIAV) infection induces immunosuppressive disease in chickens, and it has been detected in D. gallinae. However, the role of D. gallinae in the transmission of CIAV has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to assess the role of D. gallinae as a vector for CIAV through an in vivo experiment. Chicks developed viremia at 7 days post-infection with CIAV suspension, prompting the selection of this time point for the mite biting on chicks. Two methods of mite infection were then evaluated: blood-feeding and cutaneous contact, and results indicated that D. gallinae was infected by two methods, achieving infection rates of 100 % and 96.6 % within 72 h, respectively. CIAV persisted within mites for up to 63 days, although the viral load progressively decreased from 12.36 to 6.44 (day 1 to 63) (Log<sub>10</sub> copies/µL) over time. Furthermore, offsprings of CIAV-infected mites, including generations N0, N1, N2, N3, and N4, tested positive for CIAV, with viral loads of 8.58, 7.16, 8.05, 8.27, and 8.38 (Log<sub>10</sub> copies/µL), respectively. CIAV infection shortened mite lifespan but did not affect oviposition or hatchability. High-throughput sequencing revealed that D. gallinae exhibited 940 differentially expressed genes following CIAV infection, with 593 being upregulated and 347 being downregulated. The longevity regulating pathway was identified as one of the most significantly enriched pathway. Finally, D. gallinae was shown to retransmit CIAV via infection and oral administration, as evidenced by typical clinical signs, histopathology, and detection of CIAV in blood and organs of infected chicks. CIAV infection in chicks adversely affected growth performance and immune organ development. The collective findings indicate that D. gallinae serves as a vector for CIAV, which could be transmitted through transovarial and transstadial transmission within mites. Therefore, controlling D. gallinae populations on poultry farms is essential for preventing the spread of avian pathogens.","Dermanyssus gallinae is a major hematophagous ectoparasite in laying hens and acts as a vector of various pathogens.

10.1016/j.psj.2025.105268,Genomic analysis and lysogenic conversion of novel RAP44-like phages in Riemerella anatipestifer.,"Riemerella anatipestifer, an important waterfowl pathogen, causes severe economic losses because of limited prevention and control methods. We aimed to characterize the prophages of R. anatipestifer and explore their role in lysogenic conversion and fitness cost to host bacteria based on the interactive infection of 110 wild-type strains and ATCC 11845. The temperate phages PJA1, PJO17, PJR4, PJL1, and PJX6 were isolated from clinical strains and showed various lytic abilities, high similarity between different Riemerella phages, and stable properties in transmission electron microscopy, temperature sensitivity, and one-step growth curve detection. To study the effects of lysogeny, we developed five lysogenic strains by integrating phages into the genome of JW1, a wild-type and prophage-absent strain of R. anatipestifer that is particularly susceptible to phage infection. The spontaneous induction frequency of the lysogen strains reached approximately 4-log, showing resistance to each other. Genomic analysis revealed high similarity to the first characterized Riemerella phage, RAP44, particularly in structural gene modules. Lysogens exhibited resistance to superinfection by prophages, similar to the reference strain ATCC 11845. Compared to JW1, lysogens showed consistent growth curves and colony morphology but were significantly thicker and shorter in scanning electron microscopy images. The lysogenic conversion process reduced the minimum inhibitory concentration of rifampin for lysogen JW1_PJA1 and JW1_PJO17 to 1/4 and 1/8 of that observed in the strain JW1, respectively, and decreased the MIC of florfenicol for lysogen JW1_PJR4 to half of the original value. Genomic comparisons revealed prophage integration and sequence rearrangement in lysogen genomes under the action of integrase. Co-culture experiments demonstrated that sensitive JW1 could be lysogenized by phages that were spontaneously induced from lysogens. Given the high prevalence of prophages in R. anatipestifer and no significant growth defect under laboratory conditions, lysogenic conversion appears to be a natural adaptation of this pathogen. By elucidating how prophages affect R. anatipestifer resistance and fitness, our findings provide a foundation for harnessing these interactions to design effective phage-based control strategies.","Riemerella anatipestifer, an important waterfowl pathogen, causes severe economic losses because of limited prevention and control methods.

,CROI 2025: global epidemiology and prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.,"At the 2025 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), investigators presented updates on the global HIV epidemic. Although new HIV infections have been declining globally, new infections are expanding in Eastern Europe and central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America. HIV incidence remains high among key populations and their partners. Initiation of oral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is increasing globally, with 91% of PrEP starts funded by the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, and large rises in new HIV infections are predicted to occur due to international funding cuts. Several presentations focused on strategies to increase HIV testing, including home HIV self-testing, couples HIV testing, and use of digital strategies. Substance use continues to be a driver of new HIV infections. Implementation of harm reduction and opiate agonist therapy significantly reduced new infections among people who inject drugs in Malaysia, and other person-centered approaches tailored for people who use drugs are being investigated. The uptake of PrEP has been increasing in a number of priority populations; however, persistence on oral PrEP remains sub-optimal. Although the use of long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA) remains low in the US, several programs have demonstrated high persistence. When provided choice, many individuals choose CAB-LA over other available options, and adherence to follow-up injections has been high. Several interventions to increase PrEP uptake and adherence show promise, including pharmacy-based refills and incentives, point-of-care urine tenofovir testing with counseling, and use of mobile health tools. PrEP with emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide was shown to reduce HIV infections in cisgender women adherent to PrEP. A single once-yearly injection with lenacapavir showed promising pharmacokinetic results and a phase III trial is planned. Interest in doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis is high, and real-world implementation has been associated with significant declines in bacterial sexually transmitted infections.","At the 2025 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), investigators presented updates on the global HIV epidemic.

,CROI 2025: neuropsychiatric complications in people with HIV.,"The 2025 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) showcased advances in understanding neuropsychiatric complications among people with HIV (PWH). This review synthesizes key findings related to central nervous system (CNS) reservoirs, neuropathogenesis, and biomarkers of brain health. Emerging data underscore the persistence of HIV in brain tissues despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), with compartmentalization occasionally observed in the spinal cord and brain, and evidence suggesting that HIV-infected cells may contribute to chronic inflammation in the CNS. Single-cell and epigenetic profiling of cerebrospinal fluid cells revealed immune dysregulation in myeloid and B cells, suggesting ongoing CNS dysfunction during suppressive ART. Longitudinal neuroimaging and cognitive studies reinforced that incomplete or unstable HIV suppression correlates with worse brain outcomes. Notably, higher blood phosphorylated tau 217 and systemic inflammation predicted cognitive decline in aging PWH. Promising therapeutic avenues included observations that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, such as semaglutide, improve visuospatial performance in PWH and cannabinoid receptor 2 agonists reduced neuroinflammatory pathways in preclinical models. Additionally, early initiation of ART was associated with normalization of brain volumes and attenuation of neuronal injury markers. Together, these findings highlight the complexity of neuro-HIV interactions and underscore the need for targeted interventions to protect brain health in PWH.","The 2025 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) showcased advances in understanding neuropsychiatric complications among people with HIV (PWH).

10.1021/acs.analchem.5c00717,Ratiometric Optical Sensing of Aerosol Phase State with Excited-State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Probes.,"Phase transitions in respiratory and environmental aerosols impact critical processes ranging from virus transmission to atmospheric light scattering. Yet, small particle sizes and low mass densities in air make experimental measurements of aerosol phase state challenging. Fluorescence probe spectroscopy is one of the only analytical techniques capable of determining aerosol phase state in situ at the submicron sizes that are implicated in long-range virus transmission and that dominate the size distribution in the atmosphere. However, previous fluorescent probe-based measurements of aerosol phase state have relied on solvatochromic probe molecules and their associated relatively small shifts in emission wavelength, necessitating relatively high-resolution spectral measurements and greatly limiting optical throughput and therefore sensitivity. Here, measurements of aerosol phase state are demonstrated using a different class of molecules, excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) probes, that exhibit two emission peaks with an intensity ratio that is highly dependent on the surrounding chemical environment. The ESIPT probe 2-(2-benzofuranyl)-3-hydroxychromone is shown to be sensitive to phase state, including both solid-liquid and liquid-liquid phase transitions, in mixed organic/inorganic aerosols. The origin of the sensitivity was investigated by varying the chemical identity of the aerosol constituents and the results indicate that the probe is particularly sensitive to the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions, which are involved in key phase transitions in respiratory particles as well as sea-spray aerosols. These findings highlight the potential of ESIPT-based fluorescent sensing as a powerful technique for real time analysis of aerosol phase state in submicron particles combining unprecedented sensitivity and experimental simplicity.","Phase transitions in respiratory and environmental aerosols impact critical processes ranging from virus transmission to atmospheric light scattering. Yet, small particle sizes and low mass densities in air make experimental measurements of aerosol phase state challenging. Fluorescence probe spectroscopy is one of the only analytical techniques capable of determining aerosol phase state in situ at the submicron sizes that are implicated in long-range virus transmission and that dominate the size distribution in the atmosphere. However, previous fluorescent probe-based measurements of aerosol phase state have relied on solvatochromic probe molecules and their associated relatively small shifts in emission wavelength, necessitating relatively high-resolution spectral measurements and greatly limiting optical throughput and therefore sensitivity.

10.2196/72636,Big Data-Driven Health Portraits for Personalized Management in Noncommunicable Diseases: Scoping Review.,"Health portraits powered by big data integrate diverse health-related data into actionable insights, thereby facilitating precise risk prediction and personalized management of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Despite their promise, the adoption and application of health portraits remain fragmented, primarily due to the lack of a standardized conceptual and methodological framework necessary to fully harness their capabilities. This study aimed to systematically map and categorize existing research on health portraits in the context of NCD management, evaluate how big data has been used through the lens of the 3V (volume, velocity, and variety) framework, assess the extent of external validation and comprehensiveness, and identify challenges, emerging opportunities, and future research directions in this field. A scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines and 6-step framework of Levac et al. A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, Ovid, Scopus, Web of Science, and Springer Link, focusing on observational and interventional studies using big data, public databases, electronic health record systems, wearables, and sensors for NCD management from January 2014 to July 2024. Data extraction included study characteristics, modeling approaches, and external validation. Analytical synthesis was conducted using keyword analysis, the 3V framework, and visual tools such as scatter plots, heat maps, and radar charts. A total of 8707 records were identified, and 89 studies were included for full-text analysis. These studies were categorized into 4 types of health portraits: diagnostic, prognostic, monitoring, and recommender. Evaluation based on the 3V framework showed that only 17.78% of studies met all 3 criteria. In terms of volume, structured data were widely used (64.29%-100% depending on portrait type), while unstructured data usage varied significantly (19.05%-93.33%). Regarding velocity, monitoring and recommender portraits showed high reliance on digital interactive data (over 85%). For variety, only 31.11% of studies incorporated all 3 data attributes (natural, domain, and specific attributes). In terms of comprehensiveness, only 30% of studies reported the external validation, and only 10% met both the external validation and 3V criteria, with recommender portraits outperforming the other types. This study provides a standardized lens through which to evaluate the development and application of health portraits in NCD management. The findings underscore the need for more robust data integration strategies and emphasize the importance of artificial intelligence-enabled approaches. Furthermore, enhancing external validation and addressing ethical and privacy considerations are critical for advancing the implementation of personalized health management solutions.","Health portraits powered by big data integrate diverse health-related data into actionable insights, thereby facilitating precise risk prediction and personalized management of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).

10.2196/66197,Identification of Compounds With Potential Dual Inhibitory Activity Against Drug Efflux Pumps in Resistant Cancer Cells and Bacteria: Protocol for a Systematic Review.,"Drug efflux mediated by transporter proteins is one of the major mechanisms conferring multidrug resistance (MDR) to antimicrobial agents in bacteria and to chemotherapeutics in cancer cells. Therefore, the development or identification of efflux modulators represents a promising strategy to overcome the resistant phenotype. Various chemical compounds have been tested in experimental studies as reversal agents either in combination with antimicrobial or anticancer drugs and have shown sensitizing activity in resistant bacteria or cancer cell lines. Owing to the common resistance mechanisms exhibited by bacteria and cancer cells, the identification of chemical agents with dual reversal activity offers a strategy to simultaneously combat antibacterial and cancer multidrug resistance. This study aims to conduct a systematic review to identify compounds that have shown activity in reversing antibacterial as well as cancer MDR mediated by drug efflux pumps and to summarize their structural and biological parameters responsible for the interactions with drug efflux pumps. The protocol has been developed in accordance with PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols) guidelines. We searched PubMed and Scopus databases for abstracts of full-text peer-reviewed journal papers in English language published between January 2012 and September 2024. Only studies from in vitro experiments were considered if they used methods to detect changes in antibiotic sensitivity of resistant bacteria and chemosensitivity of resistant cancer cells upon treatment with efflux pump inhibitors. A total of 763 unique records were identified. Of them, 246 were selected for full-text review based on the eligibility criteria. Abstract screening was performed by 2 independent reviewers. As of March 1, 2025, the systematic review is at the stage of completed abstract screening. The next steps of the full-text review, study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment will be performed by 2 independent reviewers as well. Main data elements will include a structural identifier of the tested inhibitor, bacterial strain, cancer cell line, methods proving reversal activity, half maximal inhibitory concentration, and other relevant quantitative estimates of reversal activity. Data synthesis will be performed as a narrative summary and the content will be curated in tabular and graphical form. We anticipate that results from this study will outline the potential of various compounds to act as dual chemosensitizers and reverse both antimicrobial and cancer MDR. Our review will highlight the overlap between efflux pumps' inhibition as a strategy to combat MDR in both bacterial and cancer cells and it will provide structured data for rational drug design of dual efflux pump inhibitors.

Our objective was to evaluate intended uptake of each product and their correlates among pregnant individuals. We conducted a nationally representative survey of pregnant individuals weighted to the US population of births between September 20 and October 3, 2023. Primary outcomes included whether each participant intended to receive RSVpreF vaccine during pregnancy or immunize their infant with nirsevimab; beliefs about product safety, effectiveness and importance; and reasons for hesitancy. We used logistic regression to identify correlates of intent and product support, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, political orientation and psychological dispositions. Nearly 45% of participants intended to receive RSVpreF vaccine during their pregnancy, and 51% of participants intended to give their infants nirsevimab; 41% did not intend to use either product. Intention to use RSVpreF vaccine or nirsevimab was higher among those who were previously aware of the products and who viewed each product as safe, effective and important.

Escherichia coli, the most frequent Gram-negative pathogen in preterm infants, historically displays a low inhospital transmissibility. To report the management of an NEC outbreak in a Belgian neonatal intensive care unit and the molecular characterization of a rare, highly virulent/resistant E. coli strain.

Surveillance and clinical isolates characterized using standard methods were secondarily analyzed by bacterial whole-genome sequencing using EnteroBase for phylogenic classification and BioNumerics for resistance and virulence profile determination. A cluster of 6 infants was colonized by a single extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli strain in a 1-month period. Four infants developed severe NEC, resulting in 1 death and 3 short bowel syndromes. Although the index infant and his twin sibling acquired the strain vertically from their mother, transmission occurred horizontally through caregivers in subsequent cases. Enhanced infection prevention and control measures allowed containment of the outbreak. Molecular typing of the strain revealed a single, previously unregistered O6:H1 serotype of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli, urinary pathogenic E. coli harboring multiple resistance and virulence genes, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-encoding blaCTX-M-15 and fimbriae-encoding papA.

Microtubules facilitate long-distance transport; however, the precise role of actin dynamics and its regulators during virus entry, particularly in the transit process, remains elusive. Here, Adducin-1 (ADD1) is identified as a key regulator of actin dynamics, as demonstrated by real-time monitoring of quantum dot (QD)-labeled influenza A virus (IAV) movement. ADD1 deletion increases actin density around endocytic vesicles, disrupting general vesicular trafficking and inhibiting the replication of diverse endocytic viruses. Mechanistically, endocytic viruses or cargoes trigger the phosphorylation of ADD1 at Ser726, which reduces the density of actin branches for effective transport. Additionally, the physical force required for IAV capsid dissociation is influenced by ADD1. Collectively, the study identifies a basic actin dynamics event with broad relevance to endocytic viruses or cargo trafficking and represents ADD1 as a potential target for developing broad-spectrum antiviral strategies.","Actin- and microtubule-based transport systems are essential for the trafficking of endocytic viruses and cargoes.

This study aimed to determine immune and gut microbiota responses during military training and identify sex differences in those responses. Seventy-two military cadets (33% female) participated in an arduous 17-day training event. Blood, saliva and stool were collected upon beginning (PRE) and completing (POST) training. Immune function was assessed by salivary secretory IgA (SIgA), latent virus reactivation, peripheral leukocyte distribution, circulating cytokines and mitogen-stimulated cytokine profiles. Gut microbiota composition was assessed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Participants experienced a ~ 4% body weight loss and sex-independent increases in concentrations of cortisol, myoglobin, catecholamines and multiple cytokines. The granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio increased and SIgA decreased PRE to POST in males but not females (Pinteraction ≤ 0.02). Mitogen-stimulated cytokine profiles were generally reduced at POST versus PRE independent of sex. No differences in virus reactivation were observed. Sex differences in gut microbiota responses were limited to Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus, which increased in males relative to females (log2 fold change (FC) = 2.0-2.4; qinteraction = 0.19). Independent of sex, 24 genera differed at POST versus PRE with Lactobacillus demonstrating the largest decrease (log2FC = -0.90; qtime = 0.02) and Veillonella the largest increase (log2FC = 1.09; qtime = 0.03). Multiple correlations between markers of stress, immune function and gut microbiota composition were observed (q ≤ 0.15).

10.1126/science.ado0742,Oxygen intrusions sustain aerobic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in anoxic marine zones.,"Anaerobic metabolisms are thought to dominate nitrogen cycling in anoxic marine zones (AMZs). However, thriving populations of aerobic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in AMZs challenge this assumption and remain unexplained. Using theory and modeling, we show how periodic oxygen intrusions sustain aerobic NOB in AMZs alongside more competitive aerobic heterotrophs. Ecological theory, supported by numerical simulations and genomics, frames NOB as opportunists exploiting a fleeting supply of oxygen. Consistent with in situ observations, simulated NOB contribute substantially to total oxygen consumption at AMZ boundaries, which implies that NOB may provide a major stabilizing feedback to AMZs. Fine-scale ocean currents increase the metabolic diversity in AMZs, which could stabilize AMZ volume under climate change.","Anaerobic metabolisms are thought to dominate nitrogen cycling in anoxic marine zones (AMZs).

10.1371/journal.pntd.0013139,Smelly communication between haemaphysalis longicornis and infected hosts with indolic odorants: A case from severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus.,"Vector ticks' perception of characteristic odors emitted by infected hosts is key to understand tick's foraging behavior for infected host and design odor-based control strategies for tick-borne diseases. Laboratory mice knocked out for type I interferon (IFN) receptors (Ifnar-/-) were used to develop a simulated host by intraperitoneal infection with Bandavirus dabieense (SFTSV). Urine and fecal samples were collected 4 days post-infection and analyzed to detect differential volatile metabolites (DVMs) during infection. Next, the two salient odor cues among the SFTSV-induced host DVMs, indole and 3-methylindole, were used to test the olfactory response of Haemaphysalis. longicornis by electroantennographic detection (EAD) and Y-tube olfactometry, respectively. To gain insight into the potential olfactory mechanism, two olfactory-associated proteins, Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) and Odor Binding Protein-like (OBPL) proteins were annotated from the transcriptomic data derived from H. longicornis forelegs. Online tools were used to predict the ligand binding properties of the two proteins to the two indole candidates. Simultaneously, quantitative RT-PCR using β-actin as an internal reference gene was used to monitor the relative transcript levels of NPC2 and OBPL proteins under the stimulation of two indole candidates. The significantly regulated proteins were cloned and expressed with the vector plasmid pET-28b in vitro. The purified proteins were tested for the binding properties to the two indole candidates. SFTSV-infected Ifnar-/- mice upregulated 11 DVMs in fecal samples, mostly indoles and phenols, along with indole biosynthesis and related metabolic processes. In the urine samples, 29 DVMs were downregulated in the infected host, with eucalyptol and phenylalanine acid being the most altered. We test the olfactory responses of H. longicornis to indole and 3-methylindole, which influence tick foraging behavior. The olfactometers showed that the tick preferred both indole and 3-methylindole. EAD tests showed that stimulation of the olfactory receptor neuron in Haller's organ produced significant active potential in response to indoles. Two olfactory proteins, NPC2 and OBPL, were successfully annotated from H. longicornis foreleg transcriptomic data. NPC2 has a β-barrel structure that binds signal chemicals, while OBPL is a classical OBP with a hydrophobic binding cavity. When monitoring the transcript levels of NPC2 and OBPL in the tick forelegs, the increased transcript level (1.2-1.4 folds change) of OBPL was observed following indoles stimulation, compared to the downregulated level (0.6-0.8 folds change) of NPC2 under the same circumstances. The OBPL and NPC2 gene from H. longicornis were successfully cloned and expressed as inclusion proteins respectively. The purified OBPL (20.28 kDa) showed higher affinity for both indole (Ki 2.256μM) and 3-methylindole (Ki 4.191μM) than NPC2 in the competitive fluorescence binding assays with 1-NPN as a competitor. Facilitated by the olfactory OBPL protein in Haller's organ, H. longicornis smells and is attracted to the characteristic indolic scents of hosts induced by SFTSV infection. Olfactory associations between infected hosts and vector arthropods could provide a new perspective to understand host foraging behavior and design novel control strategies for tick-borne diseases based on pathogen-induced scent according to chemical ecology theory.","Vector ticks' perception of characteristic odors emitted by infected hosts is key to understand tick's foraging behavior for infected host and design odor-based control strategies for tick-borne diseases.

10.1371/journal.pone.0324987,Phagocytic activity of blood monocytes and neutrophils in moderate COVID-19 patients and impact of immune therapy with bacterial lysates.,"Monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells are involved in phagocytic reactions, which potentially play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Imbalance of these cells in peripheral blood has proven to affect not only innate but also adaptive immunity. It is possible that a search for strategies to restore monocyte activity could be a major step in achieving immune control over COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood monocytes and neutrophils, and COVID-19 severity, to assess the effects of a bacteria-based immunostimulating agent on phagocytosis parameters in in-hospital COVID-19 patients. The study included 105 adult patients with moderate COVID-19, who had been hospitalized in 2020-2021 and treated in accordance with the recommendations of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. All patients were divided into two groups: in Group 1 patients received standard treatment and Immunovac VP4 therapeutic vaccine, a bacteria-based immunostimulating agent as add-on therapy from Day 1 of hospitalization; in Group 2 patients did not receive any add-on treatment. The study parameters included C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), SpO2, lung involvement on chest computer tomography (CT) scan, and phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood leukocytes based on the absorption activity (AA) of monocytes and neutrophilic granulocytes against S. аureus). The parameters were assessed at 1, 14 and 30 days. Based on a cluster analysis of the clinical findings and the results of diagnostic tests obtained on admission, the patients were divided into 2 clusters: cluster 1 including patients with a more severe disease (n = 34) and cluster 2 including patients with a less severe disease (n = 71). Cluster 1 patients had higher levels of CRP (20.1 vs. 2.2 mg/mL, p < 0.001), AST (32.9 vs. 26.2 U/L, p = 0.003), lower SpO2 (94% vs. 96%, p < 0,001) and more extensive lung involvement on chest CT scan (35% vs. 12%, p < 0,001). There was a statistically significant direct correlation between blood monocyte AA and SpO2 (p = 0.04), an inverse correlation between monocyte AA and CRP (p = 0.003) and the extent of lung involvement on CT scan (p = 0.05). In less severe COVID-19 patients (cluster 2), no statistically significant correlation was observed. In more severe COVID-19 patients (cluster 1), there was a rise in monocyte AA on day 30 of hospitalization both in the control group (from 86.6 to 92.2, p = 0.03) and the main group, who received Immunovac VP4 add-on therapy (from 87.3 to 98.3, p = 0.05). However, the patients who received the immunostimulating agent, had higher monocyte PI than the controls, without the immunostimulant (p = 0.05). Patients from cluster 1 who were given Immunovac VP4 had higher SpO2 levels (98% vs. 97%, p = 0.01) than those who had received only the standard treatment. Blood monocyte AA correlates with COVID-19 severity: patients with less severe disease have higher AA and those with more severe illness have lower AA. The standard treatment, combined with Immunovac VP4 enhances phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood monocytes, which is associated with a more marked increase in SpO2, especially in more severe patients.","Monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells are involved in phagocytic reactions, which potentially play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

10.1371/journal.ppat.1013191,Induction of tunnelling nanotube-like structures by influenza A viruses requires the onset of apoptosis.,"As well as spreading through virions, influenza A viruses (IAVs) can evade antiviral drugs and neutralising antibodies by spreading directly from cell to cell. In cell culture this can occur by the induction of intercellular membrane connections known as tunnelling nanotube-like structures (TLSs), which are capable of trafficking the viral genome between cells. Here, we showed that TLSs are formed by IAV infected cells in vivo, and then used in vitro models to ask how IAVs induce their formation. We found that TLS formation is not induced by cytokine signalling from infected to uninfected cells, but induction does require intracellular IAV replication. IAV replication can form filamentous virions which have structural similarities to TLSs, but we found that TLS induction is independent of virion morphology. We therefore looked at the intracellular responses to infection and found that the induction of TLSs correlated with the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, the ability of IAVs to drive TLS formation can be modulated by chemically inhibiting, or inducing apoptosis. Finally, we found that inhibiting apoptosis, which prevents IAVs from inducing TLSs, lead to a significant reduction in the ability of IAVs to directly spread between cells. Our results, which suggest that IAVs can control their ability to spread directly from cell to cell by driving infected cells into apoptosis, identifies a new way in which a virus can manipulate its host to evade antiviral immune responses.","As well as spreading through virions, influenza A viruses (IAVs) can evade antiviral drugs and neutralising antibodies by spreading directly from cell to cell.

The mechanism by which this bacterium modulates these changes remains unknown. Epigenetics plays a central role in transducing external and internal microbiome environmental influences to the organism, so we investigated DNA methylation and the expression of a key histone modification enzyme in Borrelia-infected and uninfected Ixodes scapularis ticks. DNA methylation of the pericentromeric tandem repeats family, Ixodes scapularis Repeats (ISR), were assessed by methylated-DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) followed by qPCR of the ISR regions. DNA methylation of the ISR sequences was found. The different repeats had different levels of DNA methylation, however, these levels were not significantly affected by the presence or absence of B. burgdorferi. The epigenetic regulator euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2) is recognized as having a key role in modulating the organismal stress response to infections. To assess EHMT2 transcription in Borrelia-infected and uninfected ticks, real-time reverse transcriptase PCR was performed. Uninfected ticks had over 800X lower EHMT2 expression than infected ticks. This study is among the first to identify a gene that may be involved in producing epigenetic differences in ticks depending on infection status and lays the groundwork for future epigenetic studies of I. scapularis in response to B. burgdorferi as well as other pathogens that these ticks transmit.","Borrelia burgdorferi, a tick-vectored spirochete bacteria best known for causing Lyme disease, has been found to induce physiological and behavioural changes in its tick vector that can increase tick fitness and its ability to transmit the bacteria.

Lynx offers real-time HIV testing data with geo-spatial analysis for targeted testing, and has proven effective in enhancing HIV testing yield. This cross-sectional mixed methods study assessed the acceptability of Lynx among HIV testing healthcare workers in Zambia. A quantitative Likert scale (1-5) survey was administered to 176 healthcare workers to gauge Lynx's acceptability. Additionally, six qualitative key person interviews and five focus group discussions were conducted to gain an in-depth understanding of acceptability, and identify relevant barriers and facilitators. Quantitative data were analysed by averaging survey responses and running descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were transcribed and analysed in thematic coding. Data triangulation was utilised between the data sources to verify findings. Overall, the average survey score of perceived ease of use was 3.926 (agree), perceived usefulness was 4.179 (strongly agree) and perceived compatibility was 3.574 (agree).

A retrospective study was conducted between January 2024 to August 2024. The study involved the isolation of pathogenic bacterial strains from 15 corneal ulcer samples. We isolated and characterized bacterial strains from corneal ulcer samples, which were routinely collected at an ophthalmology clinic for suspected infectious corneal ulcers and examined their resistance to twenty-six routinely prescribed antibiotics. The bacterial species included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. coli among others. Antibiotic resistance patterns were assessed, with a focus on commonly used antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, gentamycin, and vancomycin. The study measured the healing rates of corneal ulcer patients, antibiotic resistance levels across bacterial strains, and specific treatment responses to various antibiotics. Thirteen out of fifteen corneal ulcer patients healed completely, while two patients developed full corneal opacity due to infection with P. aeruginosa. Significant differences in resistance were observed among the bacterial strains. MRSA exhibited the highest resistance levels, particularly to multiple antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin and gentamycin were less effective against the isolated strains, while vancomycin showed reduced resistance, against Gram-positive bacteria. Both ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole exhibited strong connections with multiple bacterial strains, indicating high resistance. This study underscores the need for ongoing surveillance of antibiotic resistance patterns to guide treatment approaches and slow the spread of resistant bacteria. It also highlights the importance of developing new antibiotics and alternative therapies, with an emphasis on understanding the molecular mechanisms behind resistance to combat the global health posed by antibiotic-resistant infections.","The purpose of this study is to isolate and characterize bacteria from corneal ulcers and screen them for multiple antibiotic resistance, contributing to understanding patterns of resistance and identifying effective treatment strategies.

Both ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole exhibited strong connections with multiple bacterial strains, indicating high resistance. This study underscores the need for ongoing surveillance of antibiotic resistance patterns to guide treatment approaches and slow the spread of resistant bacteria. It also highlights the importance of developing new antibiotics and alternative therapies, with an emphasis on understanding the molecular mechanisms behind resistance to combat the global health posed by antibiotic-resistant infections.",PubMed

Physiological parameters measured by wearable devices can be efficiently analysed to provide early detection of infections. The COVID-19 Remote Early Detection (COVID-RED) trial investigated the use of a wearable device (Ava bracelet) for improved early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections in real-time. Prospective, single-blinded, two-period, two-sequence, randomised controlled crossover trial. Subjects wore a medical device and synced it with a mobile application in which they also reported symptoms. Subjects in the experimental condition received real-time infection indications based on an algorithm using both wearable device and self-reported symptom data, while subjects in the control arm received indications based on daily symptom-reporting only. Subjects were asked to get tested for SARS-CoV-2 when receiving an app-generated alert, and additionally underwent periodic SARS-CoV-2 serology testing. The overall and early detection performance of both algorithms was evaluated and compared using metrics such as sensitivity and specificity. A total of 17,825 subjects were randomised within the study. Subjects in the experimental condition received an alert significantly earlier than those in the control condition (median of 0 versus 7 days before a positive SARS-CoV-2 test). The experimental algorithm achieved high sensitivity (93.8-99.2%) but low specificity (0.8-4.2%) when detecting infections during a specified period, while the control algorithm achieved more moderate sensitivity (43.3-46.4%) and specificity (66.4-65.0%). When detecting infection on a given day, the experimental algorithm also achieved higher sensitivity compared to the control algorithm (45-52% versus 28-33%), but much lower specificity (38-50% versus 93-97%). Our findings highlight the potential role of wearable devices in early detection of SARS-CoV-2. The experimental algorithm overestimated infections, but future iterations could finetune the algorithm to improve specificity and enable it to differentiate between respiratory illnesses.

The use of bacteriocins as potential new antibacterial and antibiofilm reagents has attracted considerable interest. This study aimed to determine the inhibitory effects of bacteriocin PCM7-4 on L. monocytogenes biofilm formation. In this study, bacteriocin PCM7-4 of SICs (1/16 × MIC, 1/8 × MIC) significantly inhibited the formation of L. monocytogenes biofilm. Bacteriocin PCM7-4 of SICs significantly reduced the production of bacterial extracellular polysaccharides, and could decrease the bacterial motility, meanwhile, PCM7-4 significantly reduced the number and viability of bacteria within the biofilm. RT-qPCR results showed that bacteriocin PCM7-4 significantly reduced the expression of flagella, community sensing and virulence factor genes associated with biofilm formation. The results demonstrated the considerable potential of bacteriocin PCM7-4 as a therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of L. monocytogenes biofilms.","Listeria monocytogenes is a significant zoonotic pathogen capable of forming biofilms on food and other materials, representing a considerable risk to human health and animal husbandry.

N. gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to nearly all FDA-approved drugs, with ceftriaxone being the only remaining effective treatment for gonococcal infections. Alarmingly, ceftriaxone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae strains were isolated worldwide, raising the potential of untreatable gonorrhea in the near future. Hence, the critical need to develop new anti-N. gonorrhoeae therapeutics cannot be overemphasized. In this study, we identified the peptide mimetic brilacidin as an effective anti-gonococcal agent. Brilacidin completed phase 2 clinical trials for treating skin infections, oral mucositis, and COVID-19. Herein, brilacidin displayed potent activity against a panel of 22 drug-resistant strains of N. gonorrhoeae, inhibiting 50% of the strains tested (MIC50) at the concentration of 4 µg/mL. The peptide exhibited rapid bactericidal activity, reducing N. gonorrhoeae high inoculum within two hours. Moreover, brilacidin was superior to the drug of choice, ceftriaxone, in eliminating the intracellular N. gonorrhoeae harbored within endocervical cells. Additionally, brilacidin showed high tolerability in mammalian cells and lacked hemolytic activity in human erythrocytes. Altogether, the results demonstrate that brilacidin is a promising anti-gonococcal agent that warrants further in-depth investigation.","Neisseria gonorrhoeae is classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as an urgent public health threat due to rising infections and rapid resistance development.

Many of these viruses, including flaviviruses, herpesviruses, rhabdoviruses and alphaviruses enter the brain through the olfactory neuroepithelium (ONE) in the olfactory bulbs (OB). Due to the low percentage of encephalitis that occurs following these infections, it's thought that OBs have specialized innate immune responses to eliminate viruses. Murine hepatitis virus strain JHM (JHMV) is a model coronavirus that causes severe encephalitis and can access the brain through olfactory sensory neurons. We've shown that a JHMV Mac1-mutant virus, N1347A, has decreased replication and disease in the brains of mice. Here we further show that this virus replicates poorly in the OB. However, it is unknown which innate immune factors restrict N1347A replication in the OB. RNA-seq analysis of infected olfactory bulbs showed that IFNγ was upregulated in the OB while IFN-β was barely detectable at 5 days post-infection. To determine if IFN-γ restricts JHMV N1347A replication, we utilized IFN-γ and IFN-γ receptor (IFN-γR) knockout (KO) mice. Surprisingly we found that JHMV WT and N1347A replicated very poorly in the OB and whole brains of both IFN-γ and IFN-γR KO mice following intranasal infection, though survival and weight loss were unaltered. Furthermore, we determined that microglia, macrophages, and CD4 + T cells were the primary cells producing IFN-γ during the early stages of this infection. We conclude that IFN-γ is required for the efficient replication of JHMV in the brains of infected mice.","Neurotropic viruses are a major public health concern as they can cause encephalitis and other severe brain diseases.

Viral infections have also been linked to increased risk of developing PD. In exploring a role for each of the encoded proteins in host response against brain-directed viral infections, we previously demonstrated that two Lrrk2 knock-in variants as well as Snca expression altered survival rates from viral encephalitis following intranasal inoculation of newborn mice with a double-stranded RNA virus: respiratory-enteric-orphan virus, serotype-3 strain Dearing (reovirus T3D). Here, we examined whether outcomes of direct inoculation of the brain by reovirus T3D, which invariably causes lethal encephalitis within 15 days, would also be modified by variants in Lrrk2 and Snca. When we inoculated newborn mice intracerebrally with reovirus T3D, we found that compared to wild-type littermates Lrrk2 p.G2019S kinase-hyperactive and p.D1994S kinase-inactive mutant mice did not show any significant difference in time-to-death or in viral titres in the brain, and revealed no sex difference. In parallel studies, the reduction or absence of endogenous α-synuclein did not alter the course of disease in reovirus T3D-infected mice. Together, these findings suggest that while variants in the PD-linked Lrrk2 and Snca genes influenced disease outcomes of intranasally acquired reovirus T3D encephalitis, they did not affect survival outcomes in the intracerebrally acquired reovirus T3D encephalitis model.","Variants at the leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2) and α-synuclein (SNCA) loci are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) risk.

A vaccine against leishmaniasis has not yet been developed and stationary phase promastigotes have utmost importance in transmitting Leishmania spp. from phlebotomine sand fly to humans or reservoirs. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze GP63 protein in three different Leishmania spp. to determine new vaccine candidate antigen against leishmaniasis using sequencing data of locally detected Leishmania strains and in silico approaches. The GP63 protein sequences of the stationary phase/amastigote form of L. infantum, L. major, and L. tropica were identified and then the gene encoding GP63 protein in Leishmania positive samples (n:59) was amplified and sequenced for variation analysis. According to the results, 4, 6, 19 GP63 variants were found within L. infantum, L. major, and L. tropica isolates, respectively. The most prevalent variants within each species were selected for further analysis using in silico approaches. Accordingly, all selected GP63 proteins were antigenic and the amount of B and T cell epitopes were 23 for L. infantum, 10 for L. major, and 9 for L. tropica. The analysis of each epitope showed that all of them were non-toxic, non-allergen, and soluble but had different antigenicity values. Among these epitopes, EMEDQGSAGSAGS associated with L. major, STHDSGSTTC and AEDILTDEKRDILRK epitopes associated with L. infantum had the highest antigenicity values for B cell, MHC-I, and MHC-II epitopes, respectively. Moreover, conserved epitopes were detected among two or three Leishmania species.

The IL-15 superagonist N-803 has been shown to enhance NK and T cell function, and thus may reduce viral reservoirs. To determine the impact of N-803 on LTs, we conducted a clinical trial where 10 PWH on effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) were given three 6 mcg/kg doses of N-803 subcutaneously. We obtained PBMCs and lymph node (LN) and gut biopsies at baseline and after the last N-803 dose. We found a non-statistically significant ~0.50 median log reduction in the frequency of viral(v)RNA+ and vDNA+ cells/g in the 6 participants with baseline and post-treatment LNs. In the ileum, we observed reductions of vRNA+ cells in 8/10 participants and vDNA+ cells in all participants. We also found significant inverse correlations between NK cell proliferation and the frequency of vRNA+ cells, and between NKG2A expression on NK cells and the frequency of vRNA+ cells. Our findings suggest N-803 may reduce the HIV reservoir in LTs of PWH on ART, an effect likely mediated by enhanced NK cell function.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune rheumatic disease with relapsing and remitting periods. It has been reported that alterations of gut microbiota can affect disease activity in SLE. Probiotics which can modify the gut microbiota may be useful to control disease activity. Therefore, the effect of probiotic yogurt was evaluated on SLE disease activity. In this triple-blind, randomized, controlled trial, the patients were randomized and divided into 2 groups. The patients had Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) ≤6 and were on a stable dose of immunosuppressant in the last 3 months. The intervention group was given 200 g of probiotic yogurt containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium bifidum for 13 weeks. The control group was given 200 g of yogurt without bacteria for 13 weeks. Demographic measurements, SLEDAI, and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) were analyzed before and after the intervention. The probiotic group (19 patients) and the control group (14 individuals) were compared. At the beginning and baseline of the trial, the probiotic and control groups' average energy intake, micronutrients, and macronutrients did not differ significantly. In the probiotic group, the amount of protein, cholesterol, magnesium, zinc, selenium, and iron intake increased significantly after intervention. There are no significant changes in SLEDAI score and disability (HAQ) between case and control groups at the end of the study. Consumption of probiotic yogurt containing L rhamnosus and B bifidum did not have a significant short-term effect on SLEDAI and disability in SLE patients.","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune rheumatic disease with relapsing and remitting periods.

The aim is to elucidate the immunotherapeutic mechanisms employed by these parasite antigens. The hydatid cyst is considered the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, a parasitic helminth with life cycles involving a carnivorous definitive host (usually dogs) and an intermediate herbivore host (human, ungulate, or rodent). The two major species of this parasite with human public health importance are E granulosus and E multilocularis. E granulosus is a highly immunogenic organism that stimulates proinflammatory responses, significant antibody production, and T cell-mediated responses. Host adaptive immune responses to the parasite are TH2 dominant, but responses are absent in one-fifth of patients. Diagnostic antigens from cyst fluid are well-known, and the high abundance of hydatid cysts in the lungs and livers of slaughtered farm animals has made it easy to access the source of cyst antigens. Emerging from current preclinical studies, antigens derived from hydatid cyst cells and fluid show potential for suppressing and regulating immune responses associated with allergic and autoimmune conditions, disorders which increase with Western-type human development.","This study explores recent advances in harnessing the immunotherapeutic potential of hydatid cyst antigens for the treatment of allergies and autoimmunity.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic role of probiotics on NEC in a preterm rat model. NEC model was induced in preterm formula-fed rats, exposed daily to hypoxia, hypothermia, and administered pathogenic bacteria. Then rats were randomly divided into four different groups: control group, NEC group, NEC-antibiotic group, and NEC-probiotic group. All rats were sacrificed at the end of the experiment. Histological examination of ileal wall under light and electron microscopes was done, and TNF-α and IL-18 staining was also assessed. Statistical analysis of data was performed. Histological examination of the ileal mucosa of NEC group showed inflammatory infiltration, various degrees of separation of the submucosa, thinning of the wall, sloughing, and loss of the intestinal villi. The villus heights significantly decreased (p ≤ 0.05) in the NEC group. Electron micrographs demonstrated signs of enterocytic death, lost microvilli, abnormal nuclei, vacuolated cytoplasm, swollen mitochondria, and loss of junctional complexes. These findings were almost reversed in the probiotic group that regained the normal villous height, and to a lesser extent in the antibiotic group which was still significant compared to the CG (p ≤ 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining showed significantly increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-18 (p ≤ 0.05) in the intestinal mucosa of the NEC group and NEC-antibiotic group as compared to the control group and the NEC-probiotic group.

Our analysis focuses on the acetogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis phases. The model incorporates two microbial populations, acetogenic bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens, and two substrates, volatile fatty acids (VFA) and hydrogen, with a specific emphasis on the inhibition of acetogen growth by methanogens. Using a broad class of nonmonotonic growth functions, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and stability of the system's steady states through rigorous mathematical analysis. Operating diagrams are constructed as functions of inlet substrate concentrations and the dilution rate. Numerical simulations further reveal the range of dynamic behaviors, highlighting the impact of methanogen-induced inhibition on acetogen dynamics. Contrary to the findings of Di and Yang in (JRSI 16:20180859, 2019), we demonstrate that when inhibition is sufficiently strong and VFA concentrations are high, the microbial community exhibits damped oscillations that converge to a positive steady state. These results illustrate the system's ability to stabilize at a coexistence equilibrium, even under the influence of an indirect feedback loop.","In this study, we conduct a mathematical and numerical investigation of a density-dependent model for the anaerobic digestion process, described by a system of four nonlinear ordinary differential equations, featuring an indirect feedback loop.

However, its impact on semen quality following cryopreservation has not been extensively investigated. Thus, this research comprehensively evaluated the cryoprotective effects of celastrol nanoemulsion (CNE) on buffalo semen by analyzing sperm quality, sperm kinematics, acrosome status, oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane potential, ultrastructure, microbiota, and apoptotic-like changes. Semen samples (n = 45) were collected from five buffalo bulls and subjected to cryopreservation following a standard procedure. Prior to freezing, Tris-extenders were supplemented with celastrol nanoemulsion (CNE) at concentrations of 0 (CNE0), 25 (CNE25), 50 (CNE50), 100 (CNE100), and 200 (CNE200) µg/mL. The results showed that CNE supplementation (excluding 200 µg/mL) significantly improved sperm progressive motility, viability, and membrane integrity in post-thawed samples and after 2 h of incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Specifically, sperm kinematic parameters were significantly improved by 50 and 100 µg/mL CNE compared to other treatments (P < 0.05). Furthermore, a superior percentage of sperm with intact acrosomes was remarked in the 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL CNE groups than in the other groups (P < 0.001). Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was significantly higher in the CNE100 group compared to the CNE0 group (P < 0.001), while no significant differences were found between CNE100 and the other treated groups (P > 0.05). Oxidative stress markers (MDA, NO, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) were significantly lower in CNE50 and CNE100 groups compared to all other treatments (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the CNE 100 µg/mL group exhibited a higher percentage of viable sperm and a lower percentage of apoptotic sperm than other groups (P < 0.05). The addition of CNE to the freezing extender significantly reduced the total bacterial count, spore-forming bacteria, and coliform bacteria count in post-thawed buffalo bull sperm (P < 0.001). Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that CNE 100 µg/mL improved and sustained sperm ultrastructure. Notably, the CNE 100 µg/mL treatment also improved the pregnancy rate compared to the control group (82.0% vs. 68.0%). Collectively, the results indicate that CNE at concentrations of 50-100 µg/mL can be effectively used for improving sperm cryo-resistance. This is achieved through improvements in sperm quality and kinematic parameters, attenuation of oxidative stress and microbiota, enhancement of mitochondrial function, preservation of sperm ultrastructure, and improved fertilizing capacity.

Here, we identified and characterized <i>DELLA</i> and <i>GID1</i> genes in <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>, the natural source of chemotherapy drugs vinblastine and vincristine. We hypothesized that CrDELLAs positively regulate vindoline biosynthesis, a precursor of vinblastine and vincristine, accumulating in light- and jasmonate-exposed young leaves. To explore this hypothesis, we silenced <i>CrDELLA</i> or <i>CrGID1</i> genes using virus-induced gene silencing. <i>CrDELLA</i>-silenced plants were elongated while <i>CrGID1</i>-silenced plants were dwarfed, consistent with their roles in GA-mediated growth. In the first experiment, <i>CrDELLA</i>-silencing significantly decreased vindoline pathway gene expression while <i>CrGID1</i>-silencing significantly increased vindoline, catharanthine, ajmalicine, and serpentine accumulation. However, subsequent experiments found little to no effect. <i>C. roseus</i> seedlings treated with paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis shown to increase DELLA protein stability, also provided some evidence for CrDELLA’s positive role in regulating vindoline pathway gene expression. Finally, overexpressed stabilized, N-terminal truncated CrDELLAs in <i>C. roseus</i> seedlings yielded significant increases in vindoline pathway promoter activity (<i>NMT</i>, <i>D4H</i>). Overall, these experiments provide weak to moderate evidence for CrDELLAs positively regulating vindoline biosynthesis.

Based on the traditional Chinese medicine theory of ""the liver opens into the eyes"" and the modern ""gut-eye axis"" hypothesis. This study investigated the therapeutic effects and immunomodulatory mechanisms of total glucosides of paeony (TGP) using a NOD mouse model. The results showed that TGP significantly increased tear secretion in SS mice, alleviated corneal and conjunctival damage, improved pathological changes in the Harderian gland, reduced inflammatory infiltration, and restored glandular secretory function. At the molecular level, TGP markedly downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-17 while upregulating anti-inflammatory factors like IL-10 and TGF-β, effectively modulating the Th17/Treg immune balance. Additionally, TGP enhanced the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-3) in SS mice, repairing intestinal barrier function. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that TGP intervention regulated gut microbiota composition in SS mice, reducing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus. Functional prediction analysis indicated that TGP-modulated gut microbiota primarily participated in key metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. In conclusion, TGP can ameliorate ocular surface damage in SS mice by regulating gut microecology and immune homeostasis via the ""gut-eye axis"" pathway. Our study not only provides a novel therapeutic strategy for SS-DED but also offers scientific evidence for the modernization of traditional Chinese medicine theories.","Sjögren's syndrome-related dry eye disease (SS-DED) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by ocular surface inflammation and lacrimal gland dysfunction, with limited clinical treatment options currently available.

EVD outbreaks are strongly associated with posttraumatic stress due to their high fatality rate, social isolation, due to the fear of infection, of transmitting the virus to loved ones, and of dying. However, limited research explores the mental health of children in EVD-affected areas, highlighting critical gaps. This research aims to document symptoms and determinants of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and psychological distress among adolescents living in EVD-affected health zones in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). A two-wave longitudinal study was conducted in Équateur province (March-April 2019 and August-September 2020), DRC, using stratified sampling to recruit 493 adolescents (50.1% girls). Participants completed measures assessing PTSD and psychological distress symptoms, EVD exposure, EVD-related stigma, life traumatic experiences, peritraumatic distress, and sociodemographics. The prevalence of symptoms of PTSD rose from 19.27 to 30.63%, and psychological distress increased from 39.35 to 59.43% between baseline and follow-up. Rural residents had higher PTSD (33.41%) and psychological distress (61.10%) rates compared to urban residents (8.93% and 46.43%, respectively), but there were no gender differences. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses revealed increases in PTSD and psychological distress over time (B = 7.76, p <.001; B = 4.77, p <.001), linked to EVD-related stigmatization (B = 3.78, p <.001; B = 2.54, p <.001), peritraumatic distress (B = 1.50, p =.012; B = 2.36, p <.001), and witnessed life events (B = 1.43, p =.006; B = 0.74, p =.004).

EVD outbreaks are strongly associated with posttraumatic stress due to their high fatality rate, social isolation, due to the fear of infection, of transmitting the virus to loved ones, and of dying. However, limited research explores the mental health of children in EVD-affected areas, highlighting critical gaps. This research aims to document symptoms and determinants of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and psychological distress among adolescents living in EVD-affected health zones in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). A two-wave longitudinal study was conducted in Équateur province (March-April 2019 and August-September 2020), DRC, using stratified sampling to recruit 493 adolescents (50.1% girls). Participants completed measures assessing PTSD and psychological distress symptoms, EVD exposure, EVD-related stigma, life traumatic experiences, peritraumatic distress, and sociodemographics. The prevalence of symptoms of PTSD rose from 19.27 to 30.63%, and psychological distress increased from 39.35 to 59.43% between baseline and follow-up.

Preterm infants < 32 wk' gestation and requiring oxygen till day 28 of life were prospectively followed up till 6 mo of corrected age. Nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected in infants with suspected LRTI within 48 h and processed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for RSV and other viral pathogens. For each episode of LRTI the need for hospitalization and duration of hospital stay, oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation, and deaths were recorded. Of 44 enrolled infants, 21 developed at least one LRTI episode (total 22 episodes) during follow-up. A nasopharyngeal swab for RSV PCR was sent for 16 episodes, of which nine were positive. Incidence of RSV infection until 6 mo of corrected age was 56% (95% CI 35-87) among infants with LRTI in whom PCR testing was done. Incidence rate among all infants with BPD was 1.13 per 1000 person-days (95% CI 0.58-2.17). Eight RSV-LRTI episodes occurred after discharge: five (62%) required re-hospitalization and two (25%) required ICU admission, with a median duration of hospital stay of 12 d (10-37 d) and a median oxygen requirement of 10 d (2-33 d). No infant died during an active RSV-LRTI episode. Nearly half of the LRTI episodes among preterm infants with BPD are caused by RSV, with high rates of hospitalizations and ICU admissions. RSV prophylaxis using monoclonal antibodies is a high priority in these infants.","To determine the incidence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

Recently, banana fruit rot and rachis rot have emerged in several banana plantations across Guangxi, China. This study aims to identify the pathogens of the diseases and investigate their potential interrelations. Pathogenicity tests were conducted on banana plants with eight representative strains isolated from the rachides and fruits of Cavendish (AAA) and Pisang awak (ABB) banana cultivars. Pathogen identification was achieved through morphological, physiological, and biochemical tests, coupled with phylogenetic analysis based on multi-gene sequences. Comparative analyses were then performed on growth and pathogenic virulence of the bacteria isolated from the fruits and rachides of the two banana cultivars. The pathogens causing fruit rot and rachis rot in Cavendish bananas were identified as Dickeya zeae, while those responsible for the same diseases in Pisang awak bananas were identified as Dickeya fangzhongdai. In addition, D. zeae strains exhibited optimal growth at pH 7.0, whereas D. fangzhongdai strains showed optimal growth at pH 7.5. Strains isolated from rachides exhibited higher motility and pectinase activity compared with those isolated from fruits of the same host. D. zeae exhibited significantly higher virulence toward Cavendish bananas, whereas D. fangzhongdai showed greater virulence toward Pisang awak. This study provides the first evidence of D. zeae causing both rachis and fruit rot in bananas, and D. fangzhongdai as a causal agent of banana fruit rot. Furthermore, each pathogen demonstrated distinct host preferences, with D. zeae predominantly infecting Cavendish cultivars and D. fangzhongdai targeting Pisang awak. These findings offer new insights into the bacterial rot diseases of bananas caused by Dickeya spp.","Banana, a globally significant economic fruit, faces major production constraints due to pests and diseases.

However, a significant limitation is that ONB photocages typically absorb in the UV/blue light region, which is phototoxic to living systems and exhibits limited tissue penetration. In this study, we present a novel approach for near-infrared (NIR) light-triggered photodecaging of the ONB core using silicon rhodamine (SiR) as a photoredox catalyst. The reaction efficiently uncages ONB substrates under 660 nm light irradiation, achieving high yields across a diverse range of substrates, including amino acids, nucleotides, prodrugs, bioactive small molecules, caged fluorescent dyes, and proteins. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the uncaging reaction proceeds through nitroreduction via a single electron transfer mechanism, followed by an electron cascade-triggered self-immolation process. The reaction has been successfully applied in both mammalian cells and bacteria. Furthermore, we developed a NIR light-activated prodrug release protocol for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting noninternalizable cancer cell surface markers and demonstrated the utility of this approach in a tumor-bearing mouse model.","The ortho-nitrobenzyl (ONB) group is one of the most widely utilized photocages for spatiotemporal control of biological processes via the light-triggered activation of small molecules and macromolecules.

The dilemma of community-acquired respiratory viruses in adults and pediatrics before allogeneic stem cell transplantation and chimeric-antigen-receptor T-cell therapy.,"This review explores the impact of community-acquired respiratory virus (CARV) infections on outcomes before proceeding with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and chimeric-antigen-receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy recipients and which conditions should be considered to delay or proceed with cell therapy. It aims to assess current practices, the risks associated with early CARV infections in cell therapy recipients, and potential modifications to reduce complications and improve clinical outcomes if delay is not an option. Studies have shown that pretransplant CARV infections, particularly those with symptomatic lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD), are linked to increased mortality and prolonged hospitalization after hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The timing of CARV infection regarding the transplant, the type of CARV, and the intensity of immunosuppressive conditioning, among others, are key factors influencing outcomes. Additionally, recent research highlights the potential benefits of delaying transplantation, optimizing immunosuppression, and reducing the duration of neutropenia and lymphopenia to mitigate the risk of severe infections. Key challenges include determining the optimal timing for transplant in CARV-positive patients, managing cell procedures, and minimizing risk factors to reduce the development of a severe course resulting in poor outcome. Current practices often prioritize timely transplant/CAR-T procedures but may need to be adjusted to account for CARV infections. Implementing strategies such as reduced-intensity conditioning, enhanced infection prevention measures, and antiviral therapy could significantly impact patient outcomes, particularly in preventing progression to LRTD and reducing the risk for fatal outcome.","This review explores the impact of community-acquired respiratory virus (CARV) infections on outcomes before proceeding with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and chimeric-antigen-receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy recipients and which conditions should be considered to delay or proceed with cell therapy. It aims to assess current practices, the risks associated with early CARV infections in cell therapy recipients, and potential modifications to reduce complications and improve clinical outcomes if delay is not an option. Studies have shown that pretransplant CARV infections, particularly those with symptomatic lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD), are linked to increased mortality and prolonged hospitalization after hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The timing of CARV infection regarding the transplant, the type of CARV, and the intensity of immunosuppressive conditioning, among others, are key factors influencing outcomes.

10.1097/qco.0000000000001119,The plumbing problem: rising antimicrobial resistance in building water systems.,"This review examines the interplay between biological and anthropogenic factors in the development and persistence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within building plumbing systems, which is of particular concern in high risk setting such as healthcare facilities. The review highlights the role of biofilms and amoeba as reservoirs for AMR and explores how engineering and design decisions, governance structures, and cleaning protocols influence microbial resistance dynamics. Biofilms provide a protective environment that facilitates horizontal gene transfer and enhances bacterial resistance to disinfection. Amoeba-hosted bacteria can evade standard cleaning practices, further promoting AMR persistence. Emerging technologies, such as digital twin modelling, offer new opportunities to optimize risk mitigation strategies. However, more consideration is needed to be given to design or management decision that may have unintended consequences, such as unintended design outcomes, such as increased biofilm growth from tap mixers and low-flow fixtures, and ineffective cleaning protocols, which can inadvertently worsen AMR. Effectively managing AMR in plumbing systems requires a multidisciplinary approach that integrates microbiology, engineering, and policy. Data driven risk assessments can identify high-risk areas that may require design changes but also can enable targeted cleaning strategies, reducing reliance on widespread disinfection that may drive resistance. Future policies must consider system-wide implications to prevent unintended consequences. By addressing both biological and anthropogenic drivers, we can develop sustainable solutions to mitigate AMR risks in healthcare and beyond.","This review examines the interplay between biological and anthropogenic factors in the development and persistence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within building plumbing systems, which is of particular concern in high risk setting such as healthcare facilities.

This advancement enables the detection of drug-resistant subpopulations that were previously undetectable by the gold standard broth microdilution (BMD) method, which has a growth limitation of approximately 10.15% ± 4.70%. Consistent results were achieved through AST of 205 clinical bacterial samples using both the EZMTT and BMD methods. At 450 nm, the overall positive and negative compliance rates were 98.94% and 99.58%, respectively, with a kappa value of 0.981 and a 95% CI of 0.974-0.988. For each of the 23 antibiotics tested, compliance rates exceeded 90.00%, with kappa values above 0.794 ~ 1.000 for 21 of them. Notably, the AST screening identified a clinical <i>K. pneumoniae</i> strain (KP007) containing drug-resistant subpopulations. Further analysis using the K-B method identified 13 drug-resistant subpopulations in KP007, with detection rates of 100% by the EZMTT method, 77% by the BMD method, and less than 44% by the VITEK method. A series of heteroresistant strains was generated by mixing the parent-sensitive strain (DH10B) with fivefold dilutions of its resistant strain transformed with an ampicillin resistance gene (DH10B-Amp<sup>R</sup>). Results indicated that the EZMTT method is more than 3,000 times more effective at detecting the resistant subpopulation (DH10B-Amp<sup>R</sup>) compared to VITEK. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the EZMTT method exhibits good consistency and stability and is a highly sensitive AST method for detecting drug-resistant subpopulations in Gram-negative bacteria.IMPORTANCEBacterial drug resistance represents a significant global health concern. Currently, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is widely accepted as a primary criterion for determining bacterial sensitivity or resistance. However, pathogenic bacteria classified as sensitive based on MIC criteria may still exhibit resistance. One crucial factor contributing to this phenomenon is the heterogeneity of bacterial resistance. Due to the small number of drug-resistant bacteria in these subpopulations, their corresponding drug resistance is often challenging to detect in MIC data.

Despite the need for novel antifungal drugs, few are currently in clinical development. Here we evaluate the antifungal activity of five phytocannabinoids against several clinically relevant fungal pathogens, with a focus on the priority pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. Our results demonstrate that Cannabidiol (CBD), and particularly Cannabidivarin (CBDV), have broad activity against C. neoformans and other fungal pathogens, including dermatophytes that cause common tinea. We found that both CBD and CBDV acted in a fungicidal manner and prevented biofilm formation in C. neoformans. Phytocannabinoid treatment impeded factors important for virulence and antifungal resistance, including reduced capsule size and disruption of mature biofilms. Proteomics analysis revealed that the antifungal activity of CBD and CBDV was linked to destabilisation of the membrane, alterations in ergosterol biosynthesis, disruption of metabolic pathways, as well as selective involvement of mitochondrial-associated proteins. We next tested the ability of CBD to topically clear a C. neoformans fungal infection in vivo using the Galleria mellonella burn wound model, and we observed greatly improved survival in the CBD treated larvae. This study illustrates the potential of phytocannabinoids as antifungal treatments and opens up new routes towards development of novel antifungal drugs.","Fungal infections pose a major threat to human health with increasing incidence of antifungal resistance globally.

Previous research found that <i>Sulfuriferula</i> spp. were abundant and active in long-term weathering experiments with simulated waste rock and tailings from the Duluth Complex, Northern Minnesota. We, therefore, isolated several strains of <i>Sulfuriferula</i> spp. from these long-term experiments and characterized their metabolic and genomic properties to provide insight into microbe-mineral interactions and the microbial biogeochemistry in these and other moderately acidic to circumneutral environments. The <i>Sulfuriferula</i> strains are all obligate chemolithoautotrophs capable of oxidizing inorganic sulfur compounds and ferrous iron. The strains grew over different pH ranges, but all grew between pH 4.5 and 7, matching the weathering conditions of the Duluth Complex rocks. All strains grew on the iron-sulfide mineral pyrrhotite (Fe<sub>1 - <i>x</i></sub>S, 0 < <i>x</i> < 0.125) as the sole energy source, as well as hydrogen sulfide and thiosulfate, which are products of sulfide mineral breakdown. Despite their metabolic similarities, each strain encodes a distinct pathway for the oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds as well as differences in nitrogen metabolism that reveal diverse genomic capabilities among the group. Our results show that <i>Sulfuriferula</i> spp. are primary producers that likely play a role in sulfide mineral breakdown in moderately acidic to circumneutral mine waste, and the metabolic diversity within the genus may explain their success in sulfide mineral-rich and other sulfidic environments. Metal sulfide minerals, such as pyrite and pyrrhotite, are one of the main sources of reduced sulfur in the global sulfur cycle.

The viral ribonucleotide reductase, which consists of large R1 and small R2 subunits, is required for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. However, herpesviruses have repurposed the R1 subunit for additional non-canonical functions in virus-host interaction and immune evasion. Here, we investigated the R1 proteins of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68), two γ-herpesviruses of the genus <i>Rhadinovirus</i>. We show that the ORF61-encoded viral R1 proteins form elongated cytoplasmic condensates in infected cells, which structurally differ from the previously described R1 condensates of other herpesviruses. Fluorescently labeled ORF61 condensates exhibited the properties of solid aggregates, as determined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) showed that ORF61 aggregates consist of filamentous bundles. The KSHV ORF61 protein interacted with the cellular cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B in infected cells and translocated it from the nucleus, the site of viral DNA replication, to the cytoplasmic aggregates. Aggregate formation and relocalization of APOBEC3B depended on a conserved Induced Protein Aggregation Motif (IPAM) in the C-terminal part of ORF61. A KSHV ORF61 IPAM mutant was vulnerable to APOBEC3B-mediated deamination and replicated to reduced titers. In contrast, MHV-68 ORF61 did not relocalize human or murine APOBEC3 proteins, suggesting that it engages different target proteins. The results show that rhadinovirus ORF61 proteins form elongated filamentous aggregates in infected cells to sequester and inactivate target proteins, such as APOBEC3B.IMPORTANCEHerpesviruses are large DNA viruses that encode enzymes similar to those in host cells. The R1 subunit of their ribonucleotide reductase is important for DNA synthesis and plays additional roles in immune evasion and virus-host interactions. This study focused on the R1 protein ORF61 of two γ-herpesviruses of the genus <i>Rhadinovirus</i>: KSHV and MHV-68. Unlike their homologs in other herpesviruses, KSHV and MHV-68 R1 proteins form cytoplasmic aggregates consisting of filamentous bundles in infected cells. KSHV ORF61 depletes the mutagenic cellular enzyme APOBEC3B from the nucleus, the site of viral DNA replication, and sequesters it in cytoplasmic aggregates, thereby protecting the viral genome from APOBEC3B-mediated mutations. This process relies on a specific conserved motif in ORF61. However, the MHV-68 ORF61 protein does not redistribute APOBEC3 proteins, suggesting that it binds different targets. These findings reveal how rhadinoviruses use filamentous ORF61 aggregates to manipulate host antiviral defenses.","Herpesviruses are large DNA viruses that encode homologs of cellular enzymes.

For <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> PA14, the type IV pili (T4P), the T4P alignment complex, and PilY1 were shown to play a key role in c-di-GMP signaling upon surface contact. The role of the flagellar machinery in surface sensing is less well understood for <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. Here, we show, consistent with findings from other groups, that a mutation in the gene encoding the flagellar hook protein (Δ<i>flgK</i>) or flagellin (Δ<i>fliC</i>) results in a strain that overproduces the Pel exopolysaccharide (EPS) with a concomitant increase in c-di-GMP levels. We use a candidate gene approach and genetic screens, combined with phenotypic assays, to identify key roles for the MotAB and MotCD stators and the FliG protein, a component of the flagellar switch complex, in stimulating the surface-dependent, increased c-di-GMP level noted for these flagellar mutants. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing a role for the stators in surface sensing. We also show that mutations in the genes coding for the DGCs SadC and RoeA, as well as SadB, a protein involved in early surface colonization, abrogate the increased c-d-GMP-related phenotypes of the Δ<i>flgK</i> mutant. Together, these data indicate that bacteria monitor the status of flagellar synthesis and function during surface sensing as a mechanism to trigger the biofilm program.

MPXV can be divided into clades I and II, which are further divided into subclades Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb. Since May 2022, subclade IIb MPXV has rapidly spread outside Africa to more than 100 countries due to increased human-to-human transmission. Clade I is a more virulent MPXV endemic in Central Africa with up to 10% mortality in humans. Clade I has recently evolved into a novel subclade Ib and caused outbreaks in non-endemic neighboring countries and other continents. In response to mpox, the World Health Organization has declared Public Health Emergencies of International Concern in July 2022 (subclade IIb) and August 2024 (subclade Ib). The emergence and spread of the more virulent subclade Ib MPXV has caused a significant global public health threat, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The evolution of MPXV has outpaced the development of novel diagnostic assays, hampering the global response. There is an urgent need for additional diagnostic tools for the detection and surveillance of MPXV, especially subclade Ib MPXV, in LMICs.

This antimicrobial efficacy is independent of its disulfide bonds and is enhanced when the peptide is membrane-tethered. Apamin selectively inhibits pathogenic bacteria, such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>, and <i>Escherichia coli</i>, while promoting beneficial bacteria like <i>Lactobacillus plantarum,</i> thereby improving the gut microbiome. This gut-localized antimicrobial activity is associated with increased intestinal stem cell proliferation, midgut acidification, and enteroendocrine cell calcium signaling. Furthermore, apamin's antimicrobial function relies on specific peptidoglycan recognition proteins, particularly PGRP-LA and PGRP-SCs. Apamin expression alone is sufficient to restore the integrity of the gut barrier compromised by stressful conditions. Ultimately, apamin supplementation enhances honeybee gut health in the presence of ingested bacteria. The expression of other honeybee antimicrobial peptides also significantly reduces bacterial infection in flies.

10.1128/spectrum.02536-24,Gut microbiota regulates the brain metabolism of sexually mature drones.,"Previous studies have found that gut microbiota and metabolites may be crucial in insect sexual maturation. For example, during sexual maturity, the increased dopamine in the drone's brain can affect its reproductive behavior, such as flight, mating, and so on. In addition, gut microbiota can affect brain functions such as learning and memory through metabolites. However, it is currently unclear about the changes in gut microbiota during drone sexual maturation and whether they can affect brain function through their metabolites. Thus, we analyzed gut microbiota and brain metabolome in drones during sexual maturation based on multi-omics and identified markers associated with sexual maturation. In addition, we also explored the potential correlation between differentially expressed microorganisms and metabolites before and after sexual maturation. The results showed significant changes in microbes (<i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Chaetothyriales</i>, <i>Mortierella</i>, and <i>Entrophospora</i>), and metabolite pathways (glycerophospholipids), with substantial changes. <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Chaetothyriales</i> showed the most significant changes and therefore can be used as marker bacteria in the sexual maturation of drones. In addition, PS (16:0/20:1(11Z)), PE (P-18:0/20:4), and LysoPC (P-18:0/0:0) showed significant differences in the variation of substances, which can be used as markers related to memory in sexually mature drones. This suggests that the intestinal flora of sexually mature drones undergoes substantial changes and has a stronger glycerophospholipid metabolism. Furthermore, microbial-metabolite correlation analysis revealed that <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Aspergillus</i>, <i>Mortierella</i>, and <i>Pleosporales</i> were strongly correlated with PC and PE in the glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway. Therefore, we hypothesize that these four species may affect drones' brain function by influencing glycerophospholipid metabolism, thereby affecting their learning and memory behavior. These findings provide new insights into the interactions between sexual maturation, gut microbes, and brain metabolism in drones.IMPORTANCELearning and memory are essential for drones to mate with the queen, for example, drones need to learn and memorize the sex pheromone of the queen through olfaction to find the queen for mating. However, research in this area is still limited.

The themes that emerged corresponded to five COM-B subcomponents and represented barriers relating to psychological capability, physical opportunity, social opportunity, reflective motivation and automatic motivation. Within each of the five subcomponents were subthemes, such as limited knowledge; challenges accessing diagnostics, expert care, clinical trials, and treatment; as well as the social and cultural impacts of stigma, discrimination and quality of life. Future hepatitis B interventions should focus on addressing identified gaps and consider behavioural interventions as methods to address identified barriers. While this study further validated previously identified barriers, it also newly identified motivation among those with hepatitis B to seek out information related to care, management and prolonging life.","Over 250 million individuals live with chronic hepatitis B worldwide.

10.1039/d5fo00169b,A review of the capacity of xylooligosaccharides to modulate gut microbiota and promote health.,"Xylooligosaccharides (XOS), derived from lignocellulosic biomass and algae, have emerged as promising prebiotics due to their ability to selectively modulate gut microbiota and confer various health benefits. XOS are composed of β-D-xylopyranose units linked by β-glycosidic bonds and are resistant to mammalian digestion but fermentable by beneficial gut bacteria. Research results indicate that XOS enhance the growth of probiotics, having a bifidogenic effect, which stimulates the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and suppress the proliferation of pathogens. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies demonstrate their potential to alleviate metabolic disorders, improve lipid profiles, reduce inflammation, and restore gut homeostasis. Several studies in humans or animal models reveal positive outcomes on gut microbiota diversity, immune function, and metabolic parameters in both healthy and diseased individuals, including improvements in bowel health, obesity, and type 2 diabetes markers. Additionally, XOS exhibit promising anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties, with evidence of their role in reducing tumour cell proliferation and enhancing oxidative stress resistance. Despite these promising findings, challenges remain in cost-effective production and large-scale application. Advances in biotechnological methods and regulatory approvals are expected to drive the expansion of the XOS market, projected to grow significantly over the next decade. This review highlights the potential of XOS as a functional dietary component with applications in gut health and disease prevention, warranting further clinical studies to confirm their therapeutic efficacy in humans.","Xylooligosaccharides (XOS), derived from lignocellulosic biomass and algae, have emerged as promising prebiotics due to their ability to selectively modulate gut microbiota and confer various health benefits.

Recent studies have shown that Mn-oxidizing bacteria can harbor multiple Mn oxidases, but environmental controls on the regulation of these enzymes are unknown. Here, we examine the activation of the genes encoding for MnxG and McoA, two Mn oxidases in <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> GB-1, in response to varying Mn(II) concentrations. Using reporter gene fusion strains, we found that <i>mnxG</i> and <i>mcoA</i> are activated only by a fraction of the cells in the population and at different threshold Mn concentrations, with an increasing proportion of cells expressing <i>mnxG</i> (<10 μM) and then <i>mcoA</i> (>10 to 500 μM). Kinetic modeling showed that coexpression of <i>mnxG</i> and <i>mcoA</i> not only alleviates substrate saturation and inhibition of MnxG at high Mn(II) concentrations but also results in an 8-fold increase in the initial rate of Mn oxidation in the wild type compared to strains lacking <i>mnxG</i> or <i>mcoA</i>. The population-level control of gene activation and, ultimately, Mn oxide precipitation, in response to the initial Mn(II) concentration, shows that <i>P. putida</i> fine-tunes the regulation of multiple Mn oxidases to operate under varying environmental conditions.","Manganese (Mn) oxides are commonly precipitated by bacteria and fungi.

This 5-year prospective longitudinal study included virologically-suppressed PWH receiving regimens based on the integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Body weight was measured annually, with significant weight gain defined as a ≥10% increase between consecutive measurements or compared to baseline. Gut microbiota profiling was conducted using 16S rRNA sequencing (V3-V4 regions) via the Illumina MiSeq platform. 202 participants were recruited, with 169 completing the 240-week follow-up. Among these, 63 remained on INSTI-based, 79 on NNRTI-based and 27 on NNRTI + INSTI-based regimens. Median (interquartile range (IQR)) 5-year weight gain was 1.3 (-2.8 to 4.5) kg. Significant weight gain occurred in 70 (34.7%) participants, including 20 (9.9%) with ≥10% gain between consecutive measurements and 50 (24.8%) from baseline. No significant differences were observed in adjusted α- and β-diversity indices between groups defined by weight gain. Adjusted analysis of compositions of microbiomes with bias correction 2 model showed that weight gain was associated with the genera Dialister and Tyzzerella_4, whereas Phascolarctobacterium was enriched in those without significant weight gain. While overall weight gain did not differ between INSTI-based and NNRTI-based groups, participants on INSTIs-based regimens showed higher relative abundances of bacteria linked to weight gain, like Tyzzerella_4 (0.05% versus 0.02%, P = 0.017) and Lactobacillus (0.29% versus 0.22%, P = 0.009). Significant weight gain in the PWH is associated with distinct gut microbiota profiles. The enrichment of weight gain-associated taxa, such as Tyzzerella_4 and Lactobacillus, in individuals on INSTI-based regimens suggests a potential microbiota-mediated mechanism modulating metabolic outcomes.","To evaluate the relationship between the gut microbiota composition and significant weight gain in virologically-suppressed people with HIV (PWH) on antiretroviral therapy.

As a result of these studies, it was observed that molnupiravir (MLP) and peramivir (PRV) could be used against pandemic. MLP affects SARS-CoV-2 replication, but it necessitates high doses, which can cause adverse effects in patients. PRV is a neuraminidase inhibitor, but the bioavailability of the drug after oral administration is very low. In this study, MLP-, PRV-loaded and combined liposome (COMB-Lipo) formulations were prepared <i>via</i> the thin film hydration method. Phospholipon 90 G-based formulations exhibited the most favorable characteristics, with a particle size of 111-145 nm, a polydispersity index (PDI) of less than 0.4, and a zeta potential (ZP) of 6-12 mV). Cell culture studies demonstrated that developed stable formulations are nontoxic to L929 and Vero E6 cells. Antiviral activity assessments against SARS-CoV-2 suggested the effectiveness of liposomes in inhibiting viral activity. These findings demonstrate that a possible synergistic effect of the newly developed sustained-release COMB-Lipo formulation is suggested with the complementary antiviral mechanisms of the combined agents.

This study developed a PJI model in adult Göttingen minipigs, explicitly focusing on the early stages of infection to gain new perceptions of PJI initiation. The model was established by drilling a hole into the femoral head, followed by inoculation with either Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6) or saline (n = 4) and inserting a stainless-steel screw. The animals were euthanized within 2 or 3 days post-inoculation. Comprehensive bone and joint pathology analyses were performed. All S. aureus inoculated animals had bacteria reisolated from bone, screw, synovial fluid, and synovial membrane. Histology revealed numerous bacterial colonies in the peri-implant bone tissue, many of which were unaccompanied by neutrophils, indicating delayed neutrophil recruitment to bacteria. In contrast, all synovial membrane-located bacteria were recognized by the immune system. Digital pathology measures showed deep bacterial dispersion within the bone, at a far distance from the point of inoculation. This study presents a new PJI model, which facilitates the investigation of infection initiation and supports studies aimed at preventing PJI.

Postnatal is crucial in shaping gut microbiota, maintaining immune balance, and establishing microbe-host interactions. However, the molecular mechanisms that contribute to shaping gut microbiota in early life remain poorly understood. During this crucial phase, various innate immune receptors play an active role in influencing the gut microbiota. The DC-SIGN receptor and its mouse homolog, SIGNR1, act as a sensor, facilitating communication between microorganisms, particularly Gram-negative bacteria, and the host's immune system. This study aimed to investigate the role of the SIGNR1 receptor in shaping the gut microbiota composition during early life in a murine model. The results showed that Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum in SIGNR1 KO mice, while WT mice displayed a higher abundance of Proteobacteria. Functional composition analysis demonstrated that the proportion of Gram-negative bacteria was notably lower in KO mice compared to WT mice. In addition, the absence of SIGNR1 is associated with alterations in immune response and metabolic pathways, highlighting its potential indirect role in modulating the microbiota. Finally, these results suggest that SIGNR1 may influence early-life gut microbiota composition through direct and indirect mechanisms.","Increasing evidence suggests a significant interconnection between developing several chronic diseases later in adult life and early-life gut microbiota composition.

Tetherin is an antiviral host restriction factor mediated by interferon, capable of inhibiting the release of enveloped viruses from infected cells. The antiviral mechanism of tetherin is mainly due to its unusual topology, which includes a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CT), a transmembrane (TM) domain, a coiled-coil extra-cellular region (CC), and a C-terminal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor (GPI). Previous studies have found that canine tetherin has the ability to limit the release of CIV, but its main antiviral domain remains unclear. In the present study, the potential CT, TM, CC, and GPI domains of canine tetherin were predicted through systemic bioinformatic analysis, and mutational variants of canine tetherin based on the four domains were constructed. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that the CT, TM, and CC domains are critical for the cell membrane localization of canine tetherin. The results of <i>in vitro</i> CIV infection experiments showed that the TM region is a critical functional domain of canine tetherin in limiting the replication of CIV.

Recent advances in microbiome research have opened new avenues for understanding and treating PCa; however, studies focusing specifically on the prostate tissue microbiome remain limited. Evidence suggests that the microbial communities within PCa tissues exhibit significant diversity and regional variability, with certain bacteria potentially contributing to PCa initiation and progression through chronic inflammation. The prostate microbiome comprises not only bacteria but also viruses, fungi, and parasites, and its diversity is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Methodological limitations and sample contamination further complicate the interpretation of microbiome data. The urinary microbiome is similarly diverse and shaped by multiple overlapping influences. Although urine, prostatic fluid, and prostate tissue are anatomically and functionally connected, whether urine and prostatic fluid can accurately reflect the prostate tissue microbiome remains to be conclusively determined. Among the microorganisms detected, <i>Cutibacterium acnes</i> is frequently identified in prostate tissue, urine, and prostatic fluid from PCa patients. This bacterium is known to elicit inflammatory responses through various pathways, potentially impacting tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Nevertheless, findings across studies remain inconsistent. Further research is necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which the microbiome influences PCa. Such efforts may offer novel insights and strategies for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this disease.","Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent malignancies among men, with its incidence steadily increasing worldwide.

Host genotype and sex strongly shape this early adaptation, yet their individual and combined effects remain unclear. We experimentally adapted influenza A virus to male and female BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, generating 28 independent lineages, and employed a novel ""rolling sphere"" approach to identify mutational hotspots in three-dimensional protein structures. In BALB/c mice, adaptation favored nonsynonymous substitutions linked to increased virulence, including a hemagglutinin variant exclusively fixed in female lineages. It also revealed the first demonstration of sex-dependent selection shaping a viral protein interface. In female-adapted viruses, substitutions disrupting a key NS1 dimerization motif converged on a single residue, while in male-adapted viruses, they were dispersed across the same interface. Conversely, adaptation to C57BL/6 resulted in fewer substitutions but promoted defective viral genome formation, leading to reduced cytopathic effect and attenuated virulence. This provides the first <i>in vivo</i> evidence that host genotype alone can modulate defective viral genome formation. Our results offer critical insights into host-pathogen interactions and reveal that selective pressures imposed by specific genotype-sex combinations can increase virulence across host genotypes, enabling new epidemiological modeling and disease control strategies.","Viral evolution during initial pandemic waves favors mutations that enhance replication and transmission over antigenic escape.

India's vast rural population amplifies the challenge, demanding immediate action. Despite advancements, cervical cancer remains prevalent among underserved rural communities, hindered by barriers to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) screening uptake, including socioeconomic and financial constraints. This study aims to evaluate the economic challenges encountered by rural women when accessing HPV screening. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1502 women aged 30 to 45 in Pondicherry, India, utilizing the Andersen Model as a conceptual framework. Household questionnaires gathered data on HPV screening expenses, including patient travel costs, productivity loss, and companion costs. The analysis utilized regression models, to identify the factors impacting the economic challenges associated with accessing HPV screening. The study found that employment status significantly influenced healthcare costs, with employed women incurring ₹65.78 more than unemployed women (p < 0.001). Education level was also a significant predictor, with each additional year of education leading to a ₹108.45 increase in costs (p < 0.001). Travel time had a positive association with healthcare costs, with every additional minute spent traveling increasing costs by ₹5.98 (p < 0.001).

10.5005/jp-journals-10005-3116,Does Serum Ferritin Level Affect Early Childhood Caries?-A Review.,"Dental caries is a multifactorial infectious disease resulting from the interplay of microbial, dietary, and host-related factors. In young children, the occurrence of severe caries (SC) is characterized by the presence of one or more decayed lesions in the primary teeth before the age of six. A particularly aggressive variant, known as early childhood caries (ECC), emerges during infancy and early childhood. ECC is recognized as a significant global health concern, impacting both industrialized and developing nations alike. It often presents at an early stage, advances swiftly-particularly in high-risk populations-and frequently remains untreated.Beyond its immediate dental implications, ECC adversely affects a child's overall health and well-being, with potential repercussions for their family. The condition is associated not only with pain, infection, and compromised oral function but also with broader systemic outcomes, including nutritional deficiencies and growth disturbances. Children with ECC are frequently reported to have lower body weight, impaired growth patterns, and a higher prevalence of anemia and malnutrition.Among the nutritional deficiencies linked to ECC, iron deficiency anemia-and specifically diminished serum ferritin levels-has drawn particular attention. Ferritin, as an indicator of iron stores in the body, plays a crucial role in growth and development, and its depletion can influence both systemic and oral health. Despite the widespread prevalence of both dental caries and iron deficiency across the globe, limited research has been conducted to determine whether a correlation exists between the two.Given this context, the present study aims to examine the potential association between serum ferritin levels and the presence of ECC in pediatric patients. Establishing such a relationship could provide valuable insights into the shared risk factors and possible integrated strategies for prevention and management. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across several electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, EBSCO, Embase, Google Scholar, and other relevant platforms.

Keywords and search terms included combinations such as ""early childhood caries,"" ""ECC and ferritin,"" and ""ECC and iron deficiency."" Studies were included if they examined the association between ECC and serum ferritin or other indicators of iron deficiency. Both observational and interventional studies involving pediatric populations were considered, with no restrictions placed on geographical location or study design. Findings from the reviewed literature suggest a potential inverse relationship between ECC and serum ferritin levels, indicating that children with ECC may be at greater risk for iron deficiency. However, further investigations involving larger, well-defined sample populations are needed to draw more definitive conclusions and to better understand the underlying mechanisms of this association. Management of dental conditions, especially in young children, should extend beyond the oral cavity to consider the patient's overall health. The early pediatric age-group is particularly vulnerable, and dental professionals must recognize the importance of systemic factors-such as nutritional status and iron levels-in relation to oral disease. An integrated approach that includes routine screening for iron deficiency in children with ECC could contribute to more comprehensive care and better long-term health outcomes.

Int J Clin Pediatr Dent 2025;18(4):487-490.","Dental caries is a multifactorial infectious disease resulting from the interplay of microbial, dietary, and host-related factors. In young children, the occurrence of severe caries (SC) is characterized by the presence of one or more decayed lesions in the primary teeth before the age of six. A particularly aggressive variant, known as early childhood caries (ECC), emerges during infancy and early childhood. ECC is recognized as a significant global health concern, impacting both industrialized and developing nations alike. It often presents at an early stage, advances swiftly-particularly in high-risk populations-and frequently remains untreated.Beyond its immediate dental implications, ECC adversely affects a child's overall health and well-being, with potential repercussions for their family. The condition is associated not only with pain, infection, and compromised oral function but also with broader systemic outcomes, including nutritional deficiencies and growth disturbances. Children with ECC are frequently reported to have lower body weight, impaired growth patterns, and a higher prevalence of anemia and malnutrition.Among the nutritional deficiencies linked to ECC, iron deficiency anemia-and specifically diminished serum ferritin levels-has drawn particular attention. Ferritin, as an indicator of iron stores in the body, plays a crucial role in growth and development, and its depletion can influence both systemic and oral health.

The implications of perinatal exposure to antiviral drugs on the gut bacterial population and metabolic function in the offspring is unclear but may influence health outcomes given the various reported effects of the microbiome in human health. This study aims to gain insight into the potential effect of <i>in utero</i> and lactational exposure to ART on gut microbiota populations and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production in aged rat offspring. Pregnant rats were administered a combination of antiretroviral drugs (abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine) at two different dose levels during gestation and throughout lactation, and the fecal bacterial abundance and SCFA levels of the offspring were analyzed when they reached 12 months of age. Our results showed dose-dependent and sex-based differences in fecal microbial abundance at various taxonomic levels. Specifically, we found a decline in <i>Firmicutes</i> in males, and an increase in <i>Actinobacteria</i> among males and females. Furthermore, a sex-specific distribution reorganization of <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, and <i>Akkermansia</i> was identified. No significant difference in the concentration of prominent SCFAs and IgA levels were identified. These findings provide preliminary information indicating the need to evaluate perinatal effects of ART more comprehensively on the gut bacterial and metabolic function in future studies, and their potential role in offspring health outcomes.","Despite the highly effective impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in reducing mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there are concerns of long-term impacts of ART on the health of the offspring.

This enables them to withstand stress, form complex communities, and trigger virulence responses during host infections. In this study, we examined the effects of repeated <i>in vitro</i> subculturing on the virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles of Gram-negative and Gram-positive fish pathogens. The fish pathogenic bacterial isolates, namely <i>Lactococcus lactis</i>, <i>Enterococcus gallinarum</i>, <i>Proteus penneri</i>, and <i>Escherichia coli</i>, underwent 56 consecutive subcultures in tryptic soy broth and were evaluated for virulence, antimicrobial susceptibility, and AMR gene expression. The results revealed a significant decrease in the virulence of Gram-positive pathogens. Both <i>L. lactis</i> and <i>E. gallinarum</i> exhibited a marked reduction in the mortality rates of <i>Labeo rohita</i> after repeated subculturing, ultimately achieving 0% mortality by day 56. This suggests losing key virulence factors, such as toxins and adhesins, under non-selective conditions. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria, particularly <i>P. penneri</i> and <i>E. coli</i>, exhibited higher levels of virulence throughout the study, even though mortality rates gradually declined. The antimicrobial resistance profiles of <i>L. lactis</i> remained steady, demonstrating consistent resistance to a wide range of antibiotics, including rifampicin and polymyxin B. Meanwhile, <i>E. gallinarum</i> showed slight variations in resistance, especially to colistin, while <i>P. penneri</i> and <i>E. coli</i> experienced changes in resistance to multiple antibiotics, including polymyxin B and tetracycline, after 42 days of subculturing. Importantly, no genetic alterations were detected in AMR-related genes through quantitative PCR analysis, indicating that the observed changes in resistance were likely phenotypic rather than genetic. This study underscores the critical need for ongoing surveillance in aquaculture pathogen management, emphasizing the dynamic nature of bacterial virulence and resistance profiles that can develop from prolonged subculturing.","The ability of bacteria to respond to environmental changes is critical for survival.

We attempted to recreate its physicochemical environment in a triplicate bioreactor setup and let the communities grow for 24 days. The sessile and planktonic communities were sampled daily in independent experiments and identified based on their 16S (Bacteria) or 18S (Eukaryote) rRNA genes. Time was the parameter with the strongest correlation both with alpha and beta diversity. The primary succession of all communities seems to have been divided into two temporal phases: in the first phase, approximately the two 1<sup>st</sup> days, the variations in community composition and diversity were high. In the second phase, the variation is more progressive and lasted until the end of the experiment. As expected in an aquifer rich in organic carbon, bacteria were mostly heterotrophs, except in the first few days where there were some chemolithotrophs, and eukaryotes were heterotrophs or likely mixotrophs. Unexpectedly, the alpha diversity of the sessile and planktonic communities varied following similar patterns, but the planktonic ones varied with a wider amplitude. Regarding carbon's effect, organic and inorganic carbon concentration variation explained a much smaller proportion of the variation in alpha and beta diversity than expected. We believe this is due to its high concentration throughout the incubation and to the strong limiting effect of other factors such as nitrogen concentration and pH. The communities of both Bacteria and Eukaryotes were more active than expected and their temporal dynamics and interactions should be further investigated in varying carbon, nitrogen and other nutrient concentrations to better understand how different perturbations can affect subsurface communities and, subsequently, us.","Aquifers in the continental subsurface have long been exploited for their resources.

10.3389/fmicb.2025.1576898,From single pioneers to complex pro- and eukaryotic microbial networks in soils along a glacier forefield chronosequence in continental Antarctica.,"In the extremely dry and oligotrophic soils of East Antarctica, where low temperatures and humidity result in minimal biological turnover rates, extracellular DNA (eDNA) can persist over extended timescales. Differentiating between sequences from living, potentially active cells (intracellular DNA, or iDNA) and those from ancient, non-living organisms (eDNA) is crucial for accurately assessing the current microbial community and understanding historical microbial dynamics. This study was conducted along a chronosequence in the Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica, where soil samples were collected from sites at varying distances from the glacier. By employing DNA separation methods, we distinguished iDNA, which represents living cells, from eDNA derived from dead organisms. High-throughput sequencing was used to characterize bacterial and eukaryotic communities across different successional stages. The DNA separation approach revealed distinct bacterial and eukaryotic community structures along the glacier transect. Actinobacteria were consistently abundant across all sites, while other phyla such as Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, and Proteobacteria thrived in extreme, nutrient-poor environments. Early successional stages were characterized by the simultaneous colonization of green algae Trebouxiophyceae and cryophilic fungi, alongside nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which contributed to initial soil development. The study also identified three distinct modes of microbial distribution, reflecting varying degrees of activity and adaptability. Our findings provide new insights into microbial dynamics in extreme habitats and propose new hypotheses for microbial colonization in newly exposed soils. Moreover, they contribute to the ongoing debate in microbial ecology regarding the viability of dormant or dead cells and emphasize the need for refining DNA-based methods and exploring functional pathways to deepen our understanding of microbial succession in polar regions.","In the extremely dry and oligotrophic soils of East Antarctica, where low temperatures and humidity result in minimal biological turnover rates, extracellular DNA (eDNA) can persist over extended timescales.

This study was conducted along a chronosequence in the Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica, where soil samples were collected from sites at varying distances from the glacier. By employing DNA separation methods, we distinguished iDNA, which represents living cells, from eDNA derived from dead organisms. High-throughput sequencing was used to characterize bacterial and eukaryotic communities across different successional stages. The DNA separation approach revealed distinct bacterial and eukaryotic community structures along the glacier transect. Actinobacteria were consistently abundant across all sites, while other phyla such as Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, and Proteobacteria thrived in extreme, nutrient-poor environments. Early successional stages were characterized by the simultaneous colonization of green algae Trebouxiophyceae and cryophilic fungi, alongside nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which contributed to initial soil development. The study also identified three distinct modes of microbial distribution, reflecting varying degrees of activity and adaptability. Our findings provide new insights into microbial dynamics in extreme habitats and propose new hypotheses for microbial colonization in newly exposed soils. Moreover, they contribute to the ongoing debate in microbial ecology regarding the viability of dormant or dead cells and emphasize the need for refining DNA-based methods and exploring functional pathways to deepen our understanding of microbial succession in polar regions.",PubMed

The aromatic uremic toxin p-cresol, a byproduct of tyrosine fermentation in the gut, binds to plasma albumin and cannot be removed with dialysis. However, the ingestion of densified p-cresol degrading microorganisms encapsulated in protective hydrogel beads could provide a therapeutic benefit by removing p-cresol from the colon. In this study the p-cresol degradation capacity of a known anaerobic, p-cresol degrading microorganism, <i>T. aminoaromatica</i> S2, encapsulated in polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate (PVA/SA) hydrogels was evaluated as a potential oral delivery method for intestinal p-cresol removal.

Hydrogel encapsulation of the bacteria supported high cell density packaging at 2.5 Log CFU (mL hydrogel) <sup><i>-</i>1</sup> and high activity right after hydrogel production, and more rapid activity than the planktonic cells, providing a powerful p-cresol-consuming microbial sink.

The encapsulation of 10-fold increased cell concentrations resulted in more than 2-fold increased degradation rates. With the cell densification, the estimated daily hydrogel intake could be reduced from 134 mL to 58 mL to match daily exposure, thereby achieving mass balance. The effective removal rates were due to well distribution of bacteria cells within the hydrogels. The hydrogels with p-cresol pre-induced biomass showed immediate p-cresol removal even at p-cresol higher than 1.0 mM concentration. The current study demonstrated the potential application of encapsulated <i>T. aminoaromatica</i> S2 for the removal of colon p-cresol hence offloading the kidney from processing protein-bound uremic toxins. Further research in hydrogel design could yield efficient removal as well as cell encapsulation.","Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) suffer from uremia, a condition characterized by the accumulation of uremic toxin in the blood.

Fungi and bacteria both colonize the human infant gut. The relatively smaller contribution of fungi to the gut microbiome, as compared to bacteria, has posed technical challenges for the precise characterization of fungal communities (mycobiomes) and limited the ability to longitudinally examine mycobiome development. The aims of this study were to (1) characterize mycobiome maturation and identify clinical determinants of mycobiome compositional variation during the first 2 years of life and (2) compare two sequencing approaches (ITS2 amplicon and whole genome metagenomics) for characterizing mycobiome maturational features. Longitudinal fecal samples and associated clinical metadata were obtained from subjects enrolled as part of the MAGIC (Microbiome, Antibiotics and Growth Infant Cohort) study. Overall, fungal richness increased and mycobiome composition changed in a similar ordered pattern during the first 2 years of life utilizing either amplicon or metagenomic sequencing approaches. Less resolution of taxa to species and genera levels was observed for the metagenomic dataset. The predominant taxa identified by both sequencing approaches, <i>Candida albicans</i>, <i>Saccharomyces</i>/<i>S. cerevisiae</i>, and <i>Malassezia restricta</i>, each exhibited similar dynamics in abundances and prevalences over the first 2 years of life, irrespective of sequencing approach. Antibiotic exposure and breastfeeding status contributed to time-specific mycobiome compositional variation, results that were consistent for both types of sequence datasets. <i>Candida albicans</i> exhibited altered abundance dynamics in association with perinatal antibiotic exposure and birth mode for both sequencing approaches. <i>Post hoc</i> analyses suggested that the birth mode association could be driven by exposure to perinatal antibiotics in children delivered by cesarean section rather than by birth mode itself. In summary, amplicon and metagenomic sequencing approaches provide generally similar results with respect to mycobiome maturational dynamics and the contribution of clinical variables to variation. Differences in taxa identification by the two approaches likely due to sequence database differences, primer/genome sequence variation, and/or sequencing depth should be taken into consideration.","Microbial colonization of the gut in early life is important for the development of metabolism, immunity, and the brain.

However, the microbiota composition associated with FC and the mechanisms by which metabolites influence gut motility remain poorly understood. Stool samples were collected from 60 participants (20 FC patients with delayed colonic transit time, 20 FC patients with normal colonic transit time, and 20 healthy controls), and macrogenomics and metabolomics were used to assess the differences in the microbiota and metabolite composition of different colonic transit functions in FC. In addition to assessing clinical symptoms, this study aimed to better understand how intestinal flora contributed to impaired gut motility in FC patients.

Furthermore, bacterial extracellular lipases act as crucial virulence factors, playing a significant role in the pathogenesis of bacteria. However, the production of bacterial lipases is typically low, rendering them expensive in the market and insufficient to meet the substantial demand for industrial production. To achieve large-scale production of bacterial lipases, stable and efficient homologous expression has proven to be an effective strategy. However, elucidating how bacterial lipase genes are regulated is the initial step for developing stable and efficient homologous expression, and a pressing scientific challenge. To date, the regulatory mechanisms governing the expression of bacterial lipase genes remain unclear, significantly impeding the construction of robust and high-yield homologous expression systems. Concurrently, understanding these regulatory mechanisms can facilitate early diagnosis of lipase-related pathogenic bacterial infections, and aid in the development of novel antibacterial drugs. In this review, we summarized the advancements in understanding the expression regulation of bacterial lipase genes, including direct regulators, the quorum sensing (QS) system, the Gac/Rsm system and its related regulators, as well as other regulators.

To understand potential interactions and gain insight into milk composition dynamics, we explored associations of milk mineral concentrations with maternal mineral intakes and the human milk microbiome in an indigenous Guatemalan community. In this cross-sectional study, milk samples were collected from 77 Mam-Mayan mothers and classified into early and established lactation. Concentrations of 9 milk minerals were analyzed, and maternal dietary intake was obtained from two 24-h recalls. Microbiome diversity was assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V5-V6 region). DESeq2 was used for differential abundance analysis. PCA and Spearman's rank correlation explored relationships among milk minerals, maternal mineral intake, and differentially abundant microbial taxa; results with FDR-adjusted <i>p</i>-values < 0.1 were retained. Our multifactorial analysis revealed strong associations between milk minerals and the milk microbiome and weak associations with maternal intake. Several maternal intakes (Ca, Se, K, Fe, Mn) and milk mineral concentrations (Ca, Se, K, Mg, Na) were below reference values. In early lactation, milk Fe, Mn, Se, and Cu correlated with differentially abundant taxa, while in established lactation, Fe, Mn, Se, Ca, and Na were correlated. Fe and Mn accounted for 64% of bacterial associations in early lactation and 75% in established lactation. These minerals were correlated with Pseudomonadota (early), Actinomycetota (established), and Bacillota (both), but all species were unique to each stage. Our findings reveal a complex interplay between milk minerals and the microbiome. Iron, manganese, and selenium were consistently associated with milk bacteria across lactation stages. These correlations may reflect microbial responses to mineral availability.

Fe and Mn accounted for 64% of bacterial associations in early lactation and 75% in established lactation. These minerals were correlated with Pseudomonadota (early), Actinomycetota (established), and Bacillota (both), but all species were unique to each stage. Our findings reveal a complex interplay between milk minerals and the microbiome. Iron, manganese, and selenium were consistently associated with milk bacteria across lactation stages. These correlations may reflect microbial responses to mineral availability. Further longitudinal studies with larger samples are needed to clarify how this interaction influences mineral bioavailability and infant growth.",PubMed
10.3389/fpubh.2025.1578062,"Sexual awareness, high-risk sexual behaviors and HIV testing: a cross-sectional survey among university students in Xuzhou, Jiangsu.","As societal dynamics evolve, a noticeable trend has emerged indicating that Chinese adolescents are engaging in sexual activities at increasingly younger ages. This demographic is therefore identified as a crucial group for initiatives aimed at the prevention and control of HIV. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the psychological and behavioral characteristics of gender (male and female) college students in Xuzhou. It will analyze the key factors that influence their sexual behaviors, particularly those associated with high-risk sexual practices, and explore the determinants that affect their willingness to participate in HIV testing. This research aims to establish a scientific foundation for enhancing college students' understanding of HIV prevention and control strategies, ultimately contributing to a reduction in the risk of infection. This research employed a cross-sectional survey design to distribute an anonymous questionnaire to a sample of 4,193 college students from four universities in Xuzhou. The questionnaire included items related to demographic characteristics, gender-specific psychological perceptions, sexual behavior patterns, and HIV testing status. Univariate analysis was conducted using chi-square tests, while logistic regression was utilized to examine the interactive effects of multiple variables. In the studied population, males comprised 44.0%, while females accounted for 56.0%, with medical students representing 55.8% of the sample. The survey revealed that 9.3% of students reported having sexual experience, and 3.27% engaged in high-risk sexual behaviors, with a notably higher prevalence among males compared to females. Multivariate analysis identified several key factors influencing high-risk sexual behavior, including gender, academic grade level, monthly expenditure, sexual orientation, and dating experience. Females were found to have a lower likelihood of engaging in high-risk sexual behavior compared to their male counterparts (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.122-1.623). In contrast, the risk was significantly higher for homosexual (OR = 3.12, 95% CI = 1.607-6.052) and bisexual (OR = 2.64, 95% CI = 1.289-5.423) students. Furthermore, upperclassmen and those with multiple dating experiences exhibited correspondingly increased risks. The prevalence of HIV testing within the population was 4.6%, with influencing factors including gender, whether the student is an only child, ethnicity, sexual orientation, dating experience, and previous sexual behavior. Notably, the willingness to undergo testing was lower among females, ethnic minorities, and individuals identifying as bisexual. This research examines the current conditions and characteristics of college students in Xuzhou concerning sexual psychology, sexual behavior, and HIV testing. It is advisable for universities to establish focused sexual health education and HIV prevention programs that are specifically designed to address the unique attributes of various student demographics, with particular attention to high-risk groups. Additionally, institutions should ensure the availability of accessible testing services, create a robust psychological support framework, reduce the risk of HIV transmission, and promote a healthy and safe campus atmosphere.","As societal dynamics evolve, a noticeable trend has emerged indicating that Chinese adolescents are engaging in sexual activities at increasingly younger ages.

10.3389/fpubh.2025.1545938,A theoretical epidemiological investigation into the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases during group meals among military personnel based on an individual-based model.,"Within military settings, soldiers are arranged to eat together in a self-service manner for every meal. The process of food selection and consumption often leads to close contact amongst individuals, heightening the risk of respiratory infectious disease transmission. To comprehend the transmission dynamics during communal dining, we have conducted an in-depth epidemiological investigation. The dining process was divided into two phases: lining up for food and dining at designated seats. Soldiers were randomly split into two queues and entered the food selection area from the same side. The movements of the soldiers dynamically altered both the queues and the contact duration and distance between susceptible individuals and infection sources. We utilized a random computer model using MATLAB software, with the individual as the unit of study, for simulating the food selection process. This model quantitatively analyzed the dynamic process of disease transmission within the queues due to the dispersion of small pathogen-carrying particles. Our findings indicate that close interactions between individuals during picking up food can result in the persistent transmission of airborne infectious diseases. Implementing measures such as discontinuing buffet-style meals, implementing staggered dining schedules, and mandating mask-wearing during food collection could help control disease transmission during an epidemic. This study demonstrates that the individual-based model can simulate the dynamic process of disease transmission through complex behavioral activities and is more suitable for conducting research on the dynamics of infectious diseases in small-scale populations. Since this is a simulation conducted in a virtual scenario, the results of the model still need to be verified through field investigations. Nevertheless, once robust outbreak investigation studies have yielded reliable model parameters, these parameters can be adapted to this and other similar situations to demonstrate the potential for transmission.","Within military settings, soldiers are arranged to eat together in a self-service manner for every meal.

Enzootic Abortion of Ewes (EAE) is a bacterial illness that can harm sheep by producing abortions and miscarriages in pregnant women. About six municipalities under two governorates were concerned and around 420 pregnant women were enrolled for the survey (210 participants in each governorate). Among of this enrollment, 385 participants were concerned for serological test. Our result showed that this survey among pregnant women at the Sakété-Ifangni health zone hospital revealed that 125 participants (59.52%) had been exposed to potentially infected animals or products, with 40% having touched items from sick animals. Overall, 65.24% of animal owners were unsure whether they had been exposed. As much as 28 to 38% of the women farmed alongside their husbands, which frequently led to direct contact with aborted products. The consumption of milk from small ruminants was 26.67%. This consumption was associated with the risk of <i>Chlamydia abortus</i>. Half of them had experienced pregnancy complications. Knowledge of <i>Chlamydia abortus</i> varied from 16 to 68.5%.

Although serum and urinary KIM-1 levels are established biomarkers for kidney damage, the relationship between KIM-1 levels, <i>HAVCR1</i> gene polymorphism, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate KIM-1 as a potential biomarker for CKD progression in the Thai population and explore its association with genetic polymorphisms in the <i>HAVCR1</i> gene. A total of 250 patients with CKD were recruited from Khon Kaen, Thailand. Serum and urinary KIM-1 levels were measured using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was conducted using the TaqMan assay to assess the associations between KIM-1 levels, SNPs, and CKD progression. Statistical analyses were conducted to assess the correlations between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), KIM-1 levels, and SNPs. Serum and urinary KIM-1 levels showed a significant negative correlation with eGFR, indicating higher KIM-1 levels in patients with more advanced CKD. However, the rs6555820 SNP in the <i>HAVCR1</i> gene did not show a significant association with KIM-1 levels or eGFR. Interestingly, a significant association between rs6555820 and gender was observed, implying a potential gender-dependent genetic impact.

10.2147/idr.s516945,Kinases Associated with Herpes Zoster Virus Infection Unveiled by Phosphoromics Profiling.,"Reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes herpes zoster (HZ) in humans and elicits a VZV-specific immune response. However, the effect of VZV on host protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated global changes in phosphorylation levels in HZ patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) compared to healthy controls. Using publicly available datasets, we found that the serine/threonine protein kinase and phosphatase pathways are significantly regulated by VZV infection, suggesting that VZV infection might globally alter the phosphorome of the host. To test this hypothesis, the phosphoproteomes of peripheral blood collected from HZ patients with PHN were profiled and differentially phosphorylated proteins were identified. The enhanced phosphorylated proteins were involved in pathways including complement activation, coagulation cascades, and endoplasmic reticulum protein processing. Variations in the phosphorylation levels of several proteins were highly consistent with a previously published proteomic study, indicating the synergistic regulation of protein translation and post-translational modification. Notably, kinase-substrate enrichment analysis identified CSNK2A1 and PRKACA as potential response kinases, whereas their transcription and protein levels were experimentally validated to be significantly altered after VZV infection, showing the same trend. Furthermore, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis revealed that decreased expression of CSNK2A1 may lead to a higher risk of HZ, indicating a vital role of this kinase during anti-VZV infection. Collectively, our findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying VZV infection and highlight potential therapeutic targets for further investigation.","Reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes herpes zoster (HZ) in humans and elicits a VZV-specific immune response.

Notably, kinase-substrate enrichment analysis identified CSNK2A1 and PRKACA as potential response kinases, whereas their transcription and protein levels were experimentally validated to be significantly altered after VZV infection, showing the same trend. Furthermore, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis revealed that decreased expression of CSNK2A1 may lead to a higher risk of HZ, indicating a vital role of this kinase during anti-VZV infection. Collectively, our findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying VZV infection and highlight potential therapeutic targets for further investigation.",PubMed

This review elucidates the multifaceted impact of SARS-CoV-2 on diabetes mellitus, emphasizing the increased complexity of glycemic management in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection following viral infection in the postpandemic era. In this study, we examined the diverse effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on individuals with diabetes. These effects included an elevated risk of morbidity, erratic fluctuations in blood glucose levels, the emergence of complications associated with diabetes, and the emergence of challenges related to self-management of the disease. From a mechanistic perspective, we investigated the following factors: SARS-CoV-2-mediated direct damage to islet beta cells, dysregulation of the RAAS system, impairment of islet function by oxidative stress, and the effects of the integrated stress response, stress response, and reduced adiponectin levels on insulin utilization efficiency and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, viral effects extend to diabetic complications and cardiovascular risk factors, such as coagulation abnormalities, hypertension, and lipid metabolism. This results in an exacerbation of the development of diabetic complications. This review highlights the urgent need for refined management strategies for patients with diabetes during the pandemic and in the later stages of COVID-19. Additionally, there is a need for integrated management strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the long-term outcomes of patients with diabetes.","The global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has had a profound impact on the onset, progression, and management of diabetes, posing significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide.

In patients with critical illness, the disrupted gut microbiota following infection and injury could cause diarrhea, pneumonia, and systemic inflammation. For maintaining the gut microbiota, therapeutic approaches are required to modulate host responses and prevent systemic inflammation. Probiotics and synbiotics could maintain the gut microbiota and decrease not only the incidence of diarrhea but also that of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The effects of probiotics/synbiotics differ with the type of bacteria and disease severity. Adverse effects of probiotics have been reported; therefore, the selection of safe and effective probiotics/synbiotics is warranted. Refractory diarrhea with prolonged dysbiosis may require a novel intestinal therapy, such as fecal microbiota transplantation, to alleviate gut dysbiosis.","The gut is a target organ that functions as the ""motor"" of critical illness.

The burden is particularly acute in Africa, where limited healthcare access, malnutrition, and co-infections exacerbate outcomes. Despite the introduction of maternal vaccines, such as RSVpreF (respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine), and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), such as nirsevimab, barriers including high costs, infrastructure limitations, and vaccine hesitancy hinder implementation in African settings. This article examines the challenges of RSV prophylaxis in Africa, including the economic burden of interventions, cold chain requirements, and the scarcity of robust epidemiological and surveillance data. It highlights the need for expanded molecular surveillance and localised clinical trials to ensure the safety and efficacy of these interventions. Vaccine hesitancy, rooted in historical failures such as the formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine, underscores the importance of culturally sensitive community engagement. Opportunities for advancing RSV prevention in Africa include integrating maternal vaccines into antenatal care systems, aligning vaccination schedules with RSV seasonality, and leveraging private sector partnerships. Advocacy for WHO prequalification is essential to enable global procurement and secure international funding. A dual approach combining maternal vaccines with mAbs offers comprehensive protection, particularly for high-risk infants. By addressing these challenges and leveraging available opportunities, Africa can lead efforts to reduce RSV-associated morbidity and mortality, improving outcomes for its most vulnerable populations.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in young children, accounting for an estimated 94 600 to 149 400 deaths annually and over 33 million cases of LRTI.

We report the case of a 34-year-old woman who initially presented with progressive low back pain and paraparesis. She was diagnosed with spinal sparganosis following surgical resection and histopathological confirmation. Despite an uneventful postoperative recovery, she developed progressive headaches 3 years later. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed intracranial lesions, and subsequent surgery confirmed sparganosis in the cisterna magna. One year after brain surgery and ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, the patient experienced progressive headaches accompanied by confusion. Under the initial misdiagnosis of brain abscess, she was inadvertently treated with intravenous metronidazole for 2 months, resulting in symptomatic improvement. However, a review of imaging demonstrated extensive CNS involvement, including the supratentorial, infratentorial, and upper cervical regions.

10.1159/000540700,"Prediction of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in a Portuguese Population after Hepatitis C Cure: Comparative Accuracy of Noninvasive Tests (Transient Elastography, FIB-4, and aMAP).","Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes 25% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases worldwide, a major cause of morbimortality even after sustained virologic response (SVR). Universal screening to all patients with advanced liver fibrosis is currently recommended. A risk-based strategy could improve the detection rate of early HCC and diminish the surveillance burden. Although several risk prediction models exist, exclusion of a subgroup of patients from surveillance has not yet been recommended. The objective of this study was the comparison of the predictive accuracy of transient elastography, FIB-4, and aMAP for HCC in HCV patients after SVR in Portugal. This was a multicentric retrospective study including patients with HCV after SVR. Comparative, univariate, multivariate, area under the ROC (receiver-operating characteristic) curve (AUC), and Youden's J-statistic analysis were performed. HCC incidence was 4.2% (1.3/100 patient-years) after a median follow-up of 31 months with inclusion of 337 patients. All patients had a liver stiffness measurement (LSM) before SVR (considered the baseline), but only 148 (43.9%) had a transient elastography after SVR. FIB-4 and aMAP post-SVR were calculated in all patients. Multiple parameters positively correlated with HCC, but only age and baseline transient elastography remained as independent predictors in the multivariate analysis. The optimal cutoffs for prediction of HCC were baseline transient elastography 13.7 kPa, post-SVR transient elastography 16.5 and 15.8 kPa (first and last measurements, respectively), FIB-4 1.6, and aMAP 58. Baseline transient elastography revealed a fair accuracy in predicting HCC (AUC 0.776, <i>p</i> < 0.001), with the cutoff of 13.7 kPa presenting a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 69%. Regarding patients who were F3-4 at baseline (<i>n</i> = 162), almost one-third had a baseline LSM ≤13.7 kPa (<i>n</i> = 51, 31.5%), an FIB-4 ≤1.6 (<i>n</i> = 50, 30.9%), and an aMAP score ≤58 (<i>n</i> = 48, 29.6%), and these cutoffs presented an NPV of 98%, 94%, and 96%, respectively, when considering HCC development.

As SARS-CoV-2 transitions toward being an endemic pathogen, a more nuanced understanding of immune protection in diverse populations is required. In 2023, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 1,000 Ghanaian residents to assess SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and antibody correlates of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants. We found an active SARS-CoV-2 infection rate of 1.3% and a 57% vaccination rate. We observed anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike plasma antibody sero-positivity of 98.7%, with urban compared to rural residents having higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma and saliva antibody concentrations. Vaccinated and urban individuals exhibited significantly greater Spike-pseudotyped virus neutralization than nonvaccinated and rural individuals. Notably, plasma antibodies preferentially bound Wuhan-Hu-1 over Omicron Spike variants.

DS is associated with impaired cellular responses to oxidative stress and hypoxia; however, these abnormalities have not been explored in trisomy 21 (TS21) airway epithelial cells (AECs) during RSV infection. Understanding these defects is key to identifying factors contributing to severe RSV infections in this high-risk group. AECs from children with and without DS were analyzed at baseline and after RSV infection to assess NRF2-induced protective genes against oxidative stress and hypoxia, including the enzyme heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). To investigate DS-specific defects, we focused on miR-155 and BACH1, which regulate NRF2 signaling and HO-1 expression, and are both encoded on chromosome 21. RNA-seq analyses were performed to examine genome-wide hypoxia-related gene responses in control and TS21 AECs at baseline and after RSV infection. Our findings show that miR-155 inhibits BACH1, leading to increased NRF2-driven HO-1 expression in euploid AECs. In contrast, TS21 AECs from children with DS exhibited impaired HO-1 induction following miR-155 treatment. This was attributed to reduced transcription of the HMOX1 gene, which encodes HO-1, along with global downregulation of hypoxia response genes in DS at baseline and after RSV infection in TS21 AECs. Severe RSV infections in children with DS may be linked to intrinsic defects in AEC responses to hypoxia, including NRF2-driven cytoprotective enzymes like HO-1. These findings offer new mechanistic insights into RSV pathophysiology and potential therapeutic targets in children with DS.","Children with Down Syndrome (DS) are at high risk for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections.

However, some centers face challenges in identifying and implementing preventative measures, and best practices, for the care of at-risk infants. Therefore, this study aimed to identify best practice examples in RSV care for neonatal and pediatric populations in leading centers globally, and to understand how these practices can be widely implemented. Following a literature review, multidisciplinary teams were interviewed in 10 centers globally (1 center per country; 40 interviews conducted between May and November 2023). Centers were included based on pre-determined criteria (e.g., type of center, services provided, focus on RSV research) to ensure a representative view of RSV care. The identified best practice interventions were critically reviewed by a group of RSV experts [healthcare professionals (HCPs) and a patient group representative] and assessed for their impact on patient care and transferability to other centers. Fifty-seven unique best practice interventions were identified, sixteen of which were prioritized, across five best practice themes: (1). Caregiver education and engagement: Provision of timely caregiver education on RSV infection and care. (2). HCP education: Provision of continuous evidence-based HCP education. (3). HCP-led RSV prophylaxis services: Additional support services to ensure at-risk infants are protected ahead of the RSV season. (4). Protocols and ways of working: Establishing evidence-based procedures to ensure best practices are followed within clinical practice. (5). Technology and innovation: Leveraging digital services to optimize care delivery and experience. This study identified interventions that may improve patient outcomes and quality of care for RSV disease in the pediatric and neonatal populations. The next steps will be to disseminate and implement best practice examples across healthcare systems and care settings globally.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of hospitalization for bronchiolitis in infants worldwide, and age (<6 months) and underlying comorbidities (e.g., prematurity, congenital heart disease) are risk factors for severe disease.

We investigated the effect of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 <i>(CTLA4)</i> gene in a single-center cohort of 204 KTRs. After a median follow-up of 3.1 years, 34 of them (16.7%) experienced 22 episodes of zoster and 15 episodes of HSV-1/2 infection. Homozygous carriers of the minor allele of rs231775 had a higher cumulative incidence of α-herpesvirus infection (23.5% for GG versus 7.6% for AA/AG carriers; <i>P</i>-value = 0.011) and a lower infection-free survival (log-rank <i>P</i>-value = 0.037). After multivariable adjustment by clinical factors (including use of valganciclovir prophylaxis and acute rejection as time-dependent variables), the GG genotype of <i>CTLA4</i> (rs231775) SNP was associated to the study outcome (adjusted hazard ratio: 3.21; 95% confidence interval: 1.44-7.16). In conclusion, genetic polymorphisms in the co-inhibitory T-cell receptor CTLA-4 may be detrimental for the immune control of latent HSV/VZV infection in KTRs.","Herpesviruses are able to modulate adaptive T-cell-mediated responses to establish latency within the host.

Importantly, a systematic comparison of age-dependent differences in gut microbiota composition and immune responses following CHIKV infection was conducted to elucidate the involvement of gut microbiota in CHIKV pathogenesis. CHIKV joint inoculation induces gastrointestinal infection and histological damage, drives fluctuations in gut microbiota, markedly increasing the abundance of <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> and <i>Prevotella sp</i>. and upregulates conjugates of taurine and bile acids. CHIKV infection further exacerbates systemic inflammatory burden and activates intestinal interferon (IFN) signaling cascades, which supports gut repair and mucosal regeneration, but low antiviral responses to CHIKV infection compared with that of adult animals.

Patients at higher risk of pertussis may benefit from booster vaccination (Tdap). This study aimed to estimate the budget impact of introducing Tdap into Colombia's healthcare insurance plan (HCIP) for at-risk adults (asthma, COPD, and HIV) aged ≥ 20 years. For each population, a Microsoft Excel-based model was developed with a five-year time horizon. Demographic inputs were obtained from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the World Bank Group. Epidemiology inputs were from peer-reviewed retrospective studies and systematic reviews of pertussis. Cost inputs were based on 2023 pricing data indexed to consumer price indices. Tdap coverage and market share were assumed as 10% and 74%, respectively. Without Tdap, estimated total five-year medical costs associated with pertussis disease management, in United States dollars ($), were $34.6 million (M), $37.4 M, and $9.3 M, for patients with asthma, COPD, and HIV. Introducing Tdap could avoid 135, 103, and 50 pertussis cases and 8, 9 and 3 hospitalizations due to pertussis in these populations. The total budget impact of Tdap entry into Colombia's HCIP was $1.3 M, $1.2 M and ~$137 thousand for patients with asthma, COPD, and HIV, respectively.

Most research on this topic has focused on the first three to four years of life because this is a critical period for developing gut-brain connections. Prior studies have identified associations between the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome in infancy and markers of temperament, including negative affect. However, the specific microbes affected, and the directionality of these associations have differed between studies, likely due to differences in the developmental period of focus and assessment approaches. In the current preregistered study, we examined connections between the gut microbiome, assessed at two time points in infancy (2 weeks and 18 months), and negative affect measured at 30 months of age in a longitudinal study of infants and their caregivers. We found that infants with higher gut microbiome diversity at 2 weeks showed more observed negative affect during a study visit at 30 months. We also found evidence for associations between specific genera of bacteria in infancy and negative affect. These results suggest associations between specific features of the gut microbiome and child behavior may differ based on timing of gut microbiome measurement.","The role of the gut microbiome in infant development has gained increasing interest in recent years.

The study aimed to assess the prevalence of BK virus infection in kidney transplant recipients, examine the relationship between demographic and laboratory factors and active infection, evaluate the impact of reducing immunosuppressive drug doses on BK virus reactivation, and explore the genotyping of BK virus strains in this population. This cross-sectional study utilized 245 serum samples from kidney transplant recipients. Viral DNA was extracted from these samples, and initially, Nested PCR was employed for screening to ensure accuracy, with primers targeting a segment of the VP1 gene used to detect the BK virus genome. Real-Time PCR was subsequently performed on positive samples to measure viral load more precisely. The prevalence of BK virus infection among kidney transplant recipients was 5.3%. Out of 245 kidney transplant recipients, 13 individuals were diagnosed with active BK virus infection. Genotype I was the most prevalent, accounting for 90% of the cases. The relationship between demographic factors (gender and age) and laboratory parameters (fasting blood glucose, creatinine, hemoglobin, and platelet count) was examined in both kidney transplant recipients with and without active BK virus infection. The results revealed that a reduction in immunosuppressive drug dosages, particularly tacrolimus, was associated with a decrease in BK viral load, potentially contributing to a lower incidence of active BK virus infections. Additionally, hematological analysis showed a significant decrease in hemoglobin levels in kidney transplant recipients with active BK virus infection, accompanied by a significant increase in serum creatinine levels. Balancing immunosuppressive therapy, especially reducing tacrolimus, helps control BK virus reactivation and preserve graft function.

We evaluated the spleen as an alternative to the kidney for estimating the load and prevalence of the myxozoan parasite Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae (Tb) and its relationships with proliferative kidney disease (PKD) in juvenile brown trout. We sampled 238 brown trout across nine rivers and quantified parasite load in both tissues using qPCR. Parasite load showed a strong positive correlation between the two tissues for both raw and log10-transformed data (Pearson's r = 0.60-0.71, Spearman's ρ = 0.78), with the spleen exhibiting, on average, 4.1-fold lower parasite load compared to the kidney. Tb was found in 191 specimens, consisting of 167 spleen and 190 kidney detections. The relationships between parasite load and PKD symptoms (renal hyperplasia and anaemia) were comparable for both tissues, and segmented regression line analysis indicated that health parameters deteriorate faster after exceeding a certain parasite load threshold. In conclusion, these results suggest that the spleen may serve as a viable alternative to the kidney for Tb monitoring, providing useful insights into Tb presence, load, and PKD progression in salmonids.","Accurate pathogen detection is essential in fish health management and disease prevention.
