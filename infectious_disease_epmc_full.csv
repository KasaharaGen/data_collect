10.1002/hsr2.70241,"The Current Pathogenicity and Potential Risk Assessment of Nipah Virus as Potential Cause of ""Disease X"": A Narrative Review.","<h4>Background and aims</h4>The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the potential for a severe international epidemic and introduced the term ""Disease X"" to classify pathogens that not yet identified. The Nipah virus (NiV) is highly dangerous due to its zoonotic nature, high mortality rate, and ability to cause severe clinical symptoms in humans. In this review, we gather the latest information on the NiV and its potential to become a significant candidate for Disease X.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a thorough review of articles published in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar using appropriate MeSH terms and keywords. Studies reported NiV infection were considered for this review.<h4>Results</h4>The NiV exhibits different epidemiological patterns in different countries that calls for customized prevention and control strategies. Genetic analysis highlights NiV's ability to mutate that alters possible treatment options. Transmission typically involves bats as the primary reservoir, with humans becoming infected either through intermediate hosts or food. This shows NiV's complex nature, including its ability to reach the central nervous system through the olfactory nerve. Promising treatment options, such as monoclonal antibodies, antivirals, and ongoing vaccine research, provide hope. However, the virus's adaptability, human-to-human transmission, and the lack of specific antiviral therapy raise concerns about its potential to cause a global pandemic. The interconnection between animals, humans, and the environment stresses the need for a One Health approach to tackle emerging infectious disease by NiV.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Global collaboration, surveillance, and research investments are imperative for the preparation of future pandemics. The ongoing COVID-19 challenges underscoring the critical need for sustained scientific endeavors, global leadership, and recognition of the prominence of NiV as a candidate for the potential Disease X.","<h4>Background and aims</h4>The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the potential for a severe international epidemic and introduced the term ""Disease X"" to classify pathogens that not yet identified.

10.1093/ofid/ofaf163,Incidence of Breakthrough Fungal Infections in Patients With Isavuconazole Prophylaxis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Isavuconazole (ISA) is a newer triazole that has activity against most mold species and has been utilized for prophylaxis as well as treatment in patients with hematologic malignancies (HM) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). However, several studies have documented breakthrough invasive fungal infections (bIFIs). Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the incidence of bIFIs among patients receiving ISA prophylaxis.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature using the concept of ISA, HSCT, and HM from 5 search engines. In patients with HSCT and HM, the pooled incidence of bIFI while undergoing ISA prophylaxis was calculated via the DerSimonian-Laird random effect model.<h4>Results</h4>The systematic review and meta-analysis included 35 and 19 studies, respectively. In total, 991 patients were identified as using ISA prophylaxis, and the majority had either acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (69.9%). The pooled incidence of proven/probable bIFI was 7% (95% CI, 4%-12%, <i>I<sup>2</sup></i> = 55%). The most common pathogen was <i>Aspergillus</i> species (43.1%), followed by <i>Candida</i> (22.4%) and Mucorales (12.1%). In 19 studies, mortality rates were documented and ranged between 0% and 100%; the majority of which were >50%.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In patients with HM or HSCT, we found a high incidence of bIFI while undergoing ISA prophylaxis, with high mortality. Given the lack of randomized clinical trials evaluating ISA in this indication, its role in prophylaxis remains unclear.","<h4>Background</h4>Isavuconazole (ISA) is a newer triazole that has activity against most mold species and has been utilized for prophylaxis as well as treatment in patients with hematologic malignancies (HM) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

10.1111/pde.15947,Systematic Review of the Prevalence of Tinea Pedis in Children.,"<h4>Background/objectives</h4>Tinea pedis, commonly known as athlete's foot, is a fungal infection that affects the skin of the feet. While there is extensive research on the prevalence of tinea pedis in adults, data regarding prevalence in children are limited. Therefore, it is important to gain information about epidemiology and prevalence in pediatric patients to prevent and treat this condition in children.<h4>Methods</h4>A comprehensive search across PubMed and Embase was conducted for studies published up to October 10, 2024. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting on the prevalence of tinea pedis in children (0-19 years) with a study population of a minimum of 100 children. A total of 29 studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed to determine prevalence patterns, diagnostic methods, and etiological agents.<h4>Results</h4>The included studies revealed prevalence rates varying from 0.03% to 15.6%. The most common diagnostic methods were clinical examination, microscopy, and culture. The main etiological agents were dermatophytes, specifically Trichophyton rubrum.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This systematic review reveals heterogeneous studies with variations among countries when reporting the prevalence of tinea pedis in children of up to 15.6%. Healthcare professionals should increase awareness of recognizing tinea pedis and consider it a potential diagnosis within the pediatric population.","<h4>Background/objectives</h4>Tinea pedis, commonly known as athlete's foot, is a fungal infection that affects the skin of the feet.

This systematic review aims to analyze the risk factors, clinical presentations, treatments, and outcomes of neonatal mucormycosis reported between 2004 and 2024.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science following PRISMA guidelines. Only studies reporting cases of mucormycosis in neonates (≤28 days old) were included. Data on risk factors, clinical features, diagnostic methods, antifungal therapies, surgical interventions, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 44 studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 61 neonatal cases. The most common clinical presentations were gastrointestinal (n = 39), cutaneous (n = 19), rhino-orbito-cerebral (n = 2), and disseminated mucormycosis (n = 1). Diagnosis was primarily based on histopathology (93.4%) and fungal culture (26.2%). The main antifungal treatment was liposomal amphotericin B (63.9%), often combined with surgical debridement (60.6%). Mortality rates remained high (47.5%), particularly in cases of prematurely extreme neonates with angioinvasive disease or delayed diagnosis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Neonatal mucormycosis remains a severe condition with high morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis through a combination of clinical suspicion and laboratory confirmation, along with prompt antifungal therapy and surgical management, apparently is crucial for improving outcomes. Further studies are needed to optimize treatment strategies and improve neonatal survival.","<h4>Background/objectives</h4>Mucormycosis is a rare but life-threatening fungal infection, particularly in neonates, due to their undeveloped immune system.

10.1007/s10151-024-03097-w,Feasibility and safety of biologic OviTex mesh in ventral mesh rectopexy: a prospective pilot study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Minimal-invasive ventral mesh rectopexy (VMR) is a widely accepted treatment for patients suffering from rectal prolapse. The type of mesh used in VMR remains a subject of debate. Currently, the most applied implant is a polypropylene mesh. The aim of the present pilot study was to determine the ease of use, feasibility, and safety of OviTex PGA mesh, a biologic mesh, in VMR.<h4>Methods</h4>Consecutive patients who underwent VMR for internal or external rectal prolapse were included in a prospective non-randomised pilot study in two centers. Preoperative and postoperative evaluation (90 days and 6 months) with a clinical examination and questionnaire regarding pelvic floor symptoms was performed. The primary objectives were to monitor the perioperative technical end result and the postoperative complication rate.<h4>Results</h4>Sixteen patients underwent VMR with an OviTex PGA implant. All operations were completed successfully and without intraoperative complications. The mean ODS and FISI score was significantly decreased after 6-months follow-up. No graft-related complications (GRC) occurred. Two patients developed a recurrent prolapse within 6 months.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Robotic correction of rectal prolapse using an OviTex mesh is a safe, minimally invasive, technically feasible treatment. However, further research is warranted to evaluate the potential added value of OviTex compared to polypropylene mesh on a larger scale. Long-term follow-up is essential to assess the durability of the procedure and monitor the occurrence of any new symptoms.","<h4>Background</h4>Minimal-invasive ventral mesh rectopexy (VMR) is a widely accepted treatment for patients suffering from rectal prolapse.

10.3390/pathogens14050466,Invasive Candidiasis Coinfection in Patients with Severe COVID-19 Disease: Scoping Review.,"Coinfection rates of candidiasis in patients affected by COVID-19 had a significantly increase during the sanitary contingency. The objective of this scoping review is to analyze the available scientific evidence around the coinfection of invasive candidiasis in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Online databases such as PubMed, EBSCO, SciFinder, Scopus, and SciELO were used to analyze the different scientific studies published from January 2020 to December 2022, selecting 48 publications that reported comorbidity between invasive candidiasis and COVID-19 as a study variable. Based on the PRISMA-ScR extension for scoping reviews, we identified more than half of the publications (57%) as observational, descriptive, and analytic studies, while 43% were systematic reviews. Overall, up to 169,468 adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit were examined. Coinfection was due mainly to <i>Candida albicans</i> (75%), but some more species were reported such as <i>Meyerozyma parapsilosis</i> (formerly <i>Candida parapsilosis</i>); <i>Meyerozyma guilliermondii</i> (formerly <i>Candida guilliermondii</i>); <i>Nakaseomyces glabratus</i> (formerly <i>Candida glabrata</i>); <i>Candida tropicalis</i>; <i>Candida dubliniensis</i>; <i>Clavispora lusitaniae</i> (formerly <i>Candida lusitaniae)</i>; and <i>Pichia kudriavzevii</i> (formerly <i>Candida krusei</i>). We concluded that patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 had a higher incidence of fungal coinfections, thus increasing the mortality rate, disease severity, and length of hospital stay in the intensive care unit.","Coinfection rates of candidiasis in patients affected by COVID-19 had a significantly increase during the sanitary contingency.

10.1093/ofid/ofaf001,A Systematic Literature Review to Determine Gaps in Diagnosing Suspected Infection in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients.,"<h4>Background</h4>Improved diagnostic testing (DT) of infections may optimize outcomes for solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR), but a comprehensive analysis is lacking.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a systematic literature review across multiple databases, including EMBASE and MEDLINE(R), of studies published between 1 January 2012-11 June 2022, to examine the evidence behind DT in SOTR. Eligibility criteria included the use of conventional diagnostic methods (culture, biomarkers, directed-polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) or advanced molecular diagnostics (broad-range PCR, metagenomics) to diagnose infections in hospitalized SOTR. Bias was assessed using tools such as the Cochrane Handbook and PRISMA 2020.<h4>Results</h4>Of 2362 studies, 72 were eligible and evaluated heterogeneous SOT populations, infections, biospecimens, DT, and outcomes. All studies exhibited bias, mainly in reporting quality. Median study sample size was 102 (range, 11-1307). Culture was the most common DT studied (N = 45 studies, 62.5%), with positive results in a median of 27.7% (range, 0%-88.3%). Biomarkers, PCR, and metagenomics were evaluated in 7, 19, and 3 studies, respectively; only 6 reported sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values. Directed-PCR performed well for targeted pathogens, but only 1 study evaluated broad-range PCR. Metagenomics approaches detected numerous organisms but required clinical adjudication, with too few studies (N = 3) to draw conclusions. Turnaround time was shorter for PCR/metagenomics than conventional diagnostic methods (N = 4 studies, 5.6%). Only 6 studies reported the impact of DT on outcomes like antimicrobial use and length of stay.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We identified considerable evidence gaps in infection-related DT among SOT, particularly molecular DT, highlighting the need for further research.","<h4>Background</h4>Improved diagnostic testing (DT) of infections may optimize outcomes for solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR), but a comprehensive analysis is lacking.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a systematic literature review across multiple databases, including EMBASE and MEDLINE(R), of studies published between 1 January 2012-11 June 2022, to examine the evidence behind DT in SOTR.

10.1101/2025.03.27.645790,Fighting<i>Aspergillus</i>infection using biocontrol bacteria: A proof-of-concept of environmental interference in a translational setting,"Aspergillus fungi are opportunistic pathogens that affect millions of people worldwide. Aspergilli produce organic acids to optimize the environmental pH and match the needs of their enzymatic machinery. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that this also occurs during infection. By producing oxalic acid (OA), Aspergillus would manipulate pH during lung infection and thus, interfering with this process could control the pathogen. To test this hypothesis, we assessed in silico the potential for OA production in a wide range of Aspergilli. A genetic marker for AO production was detected in most of the species including prevalent human pathogens. We tested OA production in vitro in four strains of A. niger and A. fumigatus , but only one of the A. niger strains produced OA consistently. For this fungal strain, oxalotrophic bacteria were able to control fungal growth via OA consumption. To translate this observation into a pre-clinical system, increasingly complex experiments were performed. In 3D-cell cultures, A. niger also secreted OA and modified pH and free Ca 2+ . Co-inoculation of the oxalotrophic bacterium inhibited the development of the fungus. However, biocontrol could not be replicated in Galleria mellonella , which is often used as an infection model. In contrast, the bacterium improved disease score and the absence of oxalate crystals in the lungs in the mouse model. This biocontrol interaction between oxalotrophic bacteria and A. niger represents a paradigm shift in the fight against opportunistic fungal pathogens, where the goal is to render the host environment less permissive to pathogen development <h4>One Sentence Summary</h4> Demonstration of biocontrol as a therapeutic concept to combat Aspergillus niger with oxalotrophic bacteria in an animal infection model","Aspergillus fungi are opportunistic pathogens that affect millions of people worldwide.

Among the airway-inhabiting fungi, <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> and <i>Candida albicans</i> are the dominant species that elicit protective T helper (Th) 17 and other T cell responses, contributing to airway neutrophilia and steroid resistance. However, it is not fully understood how fungal airway colonization impacts the immunopathogenesis of asthma. Here, we used a neutrophilic asthma model induced by <i>C. albicans</i> to study the immune regulation of this disease. We found that intranasal administration of <i>C. albicans</i> induced platelet infiltration into the lung. Platelet-expressed latent TGF-β could be activated specifically by Th17 cells and drive the commitment, maintenance, and expansion of Th17 cells. In Candida-induced asthma, an adoptive transfer of platelets enhanced Th17 responses, increasing airway neutrophil influx. Thus, managing airway mycobiota and reducing platelet intrapulmonary infiltration may serve as a promising interventional approach.","Microbial, especially fungal, sensitization has been associated with the development and exacerbation of treatment-refractory neutrophilic asthma. Among the airway-inhabiting fungi, <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> and <i>Candida albicans</i> are the dominant species that elicit protective T helper (Th) 17 and other T cell responses, contributing to airway neutrophilia and steroid resistance.

A 59-year-old woman with a history of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the sinonasal cavity with intracranial extension through the anterior skull base developed delayed radiation sequelae of anterior skull base ORN. She underwent an initial endoscopic resection in 2011 with persistent disease that required an anterior craniofacial resection with left medial maxillectomy in 2012. She had a radiologic gross total resection with microscopic residual disease at the histologic margins prompting adjuvant chemoradiotherapy to target volume doses of 66 to 70 Gy with concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy. She subsequently developed an intracranial abscess in 2021 along the anterior skull base that required a craniotomy and endoscopic debridement. Despite aggressive surgical and medical therapy, she had persistent intracranial infections and evidence of skull base ORN. She ultimately underwent a combined open bifrontal craniotomy and endoscopic resection of the necrotic frontal bone and dura followed by an anterolateral thigh free flap reconstruction with titanium mesh cranioplasty. The patient recovered well from a microvascular free-tissue reconstruction without concern for cerebrospinal fluid leak. Anterior skull base reconstruction with free tissue transfer is a commonly utilized method for oncologic resections. Here, an anterolateral free flap was effectively used to treat an anterior skull base defect secondary to a rare indication of skull base ORN.","Cases of delayed osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the anterior skull base have unique management considerations.

This systematic review, aimed at informing the World Health Organization's Fungal Priority Pathogens List, critically examines literature from 2011 to 2021 using PubMed and Web of Science, focusing on the incidence, mortality, morbidity, antifungal resistance, preventability, and distribution of Histoplasma. We also found a high prevalence (22%-44%) in people living with HIV, with mortality rates ranging from 21% to 53%. Despite limited data, the prevalence of histoplasmosis seems stable, with lower estimates in Europe. Complications such as central nervous system disease, pulmonary issues, and lymphoedema due to granuloma or sclerosis are noted, though their burden remains uncertain. Antifungal susceptibility varies, particularly against fluconazole (MIC: ≥32 mg/l) and caspofungin (MICs: 4-32 mg/l), while resistance to amphotericin B (MIC: 0.125-0.16 mg/l), itraconazole (MICs: 0.004-0.125 mg/l), and voriconazole (MICs: 0.004-0.125 mg/l) remains low. This review identifies critical knowledge gaps, underlining the need for robust, globally representative surveillance systems to better understand and combat this fungal threat.","Histoplasmosis, a significant mycosis primarily prevalent in Africa, North and South America, with emerging reports globally, poses notable health challenges, particularly in immunocompromised individuals such as people living with HIV/AIDS and organ transplant recipients.

To address the expansion potential into saline environments from this North American coastal invasion front, we experimentally assessed the salinity tolerance of adult round gobies. Water temperatures vary widely in temperate aquatic ecosystems, and our study is the first to investigate the effect of temperature on the salinity tolerance of round goby, conducting tolerance trials at three temperatures: a preferred temperature of 20°C, 26°C reflective of summer conditions, and 5°C reflective of winter conditions. Adult round gobies were subjected to weekly salinity increases of 3 parts per thousand (ppt), concluding at 33ppt. Study specimens were monitored for stress cues (behavior changes and color changes), and mortality. We found significant salinity tolerance differences dependent on water temperature, with the highest tolerance at 5°C and the lowest tolerance at 26°C. By 30ppt, survival was 87% at 5°C and only 7% at 26°C. Based on mortality results, round goby expansion may occur year-round into brackish portions (<21ppt) of the Hudson River Estuary as far south as the Harlem River. This would open access to portions of Long Island Sound, potentially rendering other coastal watersheds to be at risk of invasion. However, temperature-dependent salinity tolerance findings suggest round goby expansion potential into high salinity habitats may be seasonally dependent, with expansion opportunities occurring in colder months and expansion barriers occurring in warmer months. To assess longer term survival and body condition, another experiment maintained round gobies at four sustained salinities (≤ 21ppt) for ten weeks at 20°C. Growth and hepatosomatic index at 21ppt were significantly lower (p<0.001) than at 1, 9, and 15ppt, indicating sustained exposure to higher salinities may affect energy stores, potentially limiting establishment potential.","Since being introduced into the Laurentian Great Lakes in the 1990s, round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) has spread rapidly, reaching the Hudson River Estuary, NY in 2021.

Perioperative factors were analyzed to determine the potential risks of otomycosis. The primary factors identified as contributing to otomycosis were firmly adherent cerumen, tympano-meatal flap positioning, and Diabetes Mellitus (DM). The study analyzed the patients' follow-up six months after the surgical procedure. Otomycosis occurring within 30-days of surgery was classified as ""early otomycosis"", while those occurring later were classified as ""late otomycosis"".<h4>Results</h4>Graft success at 6-months showed no significant difference between otomycosis and non-otomycosis groups.

10.3390/ebj6020024,The Reconstruction of Various Complex Full-Thickness Skin Defects with a Biodegradable Temporising Matrix: A Case Series.,"<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Traditionally, full-thickness skin defects (FTSDs) are covered with split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs). This usually provides an epidermal coverage but entails a high risk of hypertrophic scarring mainly due to the absence of the dermal layer. The Novosorb<sup>®</sup> Biodegradable Temporising Matrix (BTM) is a novel synthetic dermal substitute that has been used for the reconstruction of various complex and/or large defects in our center. The aim of this article is to evaluate the clinical performance of the BTM as a synthetic dermal substitute for complex FTSD reconstruction in a European context.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This case series focused on the treatment of complex FTSDs with the BTM. After wound debridement, the BTM was applied according to a defined protocol. Once adequate vascularization was observed, the sealing membrane was removed and the neo-dermis was covered with STSGs. Patient demographics, comorbidities, wound defect localization and etiology, wound bed preparations, time of BTM application and removal, time to complete wound healing after STSG, complications, and HTS formation were recorded.<h4>Results</h4>The BTM was used to treat FTSDs in six patients with complex wounds from degloving (3), burns (1), ulcerations (1), and necrotizing fasciitis (1). Successful integration occurred in five cases (83%), with one partial integration. The BTM remained in situ for an average of 20.7 days before delamination and STSG coverage. No major complications occurred, though one case had hypergranulation with secondary STSG infection. Two patients were lost to follow-up, while the remaining four had excellent aesthetic and functional outcomes with good-quality scars.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Within the limits of this small and heterogeneous case series, the BTM appears to be a promising option for the reconstruction of complex FTSDs of varying etiologies. Its successful integration in most cases and limited complication rate support its clinical potential. However, given this study's retrospective design and limited sample size, further prospective studies are required to validate these findings and assess long-term outcomes.","<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Traditionally, full-thickness skin defects (FTSDs) are covered with split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs).

Its successful integration in most cases and limited complication rate support its clinical potential. However, given this study's retrospective design and limited sample size, further prospective studies are required to validate these findings and assess long-term outcomes.",EuropePMC
10.3390/jcm13237421,Safety and Effectiveness of G-Mesh<sup>®</sup> Gynecological Meshes Intended for Surgical Treatment of Pelvic Organ Prolapse-A Retrospective Analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> The prevalence of POP in women ranges from 30-40%, with 10-20% requiring surgical intervention. Annually, over 225,000 surgical procedures for POP are performed in the United States. The severity of prolapse is assessed using the four-stage POP-Q system, which facilitates clinical research by providing a standardized measure of defect severity. Surgical intervention is indicated for more severe cases, with various techniques available through vaginal or abdominal access. Synthetic meshes, primarily made of polypropylene (PP), are commonly used in POP surgeries due to their biocompatibility and mechanical support. This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a non-resorbable, light polypropylene gynecological mesh (G-Mesh<sup>®</sup>, Tricomed S.A., Łódź, Poland) in the surgical treatment of pelvic floor prolapse in women. <b>Methods:</b> The meshes were implanted via laparoscopy (Dubuisson method) and laparotomy or transvaginally. A multicenter, retrospective study was conducted involving 81 patients aged 28-83. <b>Results:</b> The results collected at three follow-up visits indicated a high level of patient satisfaction, minimal discomfort, and no significant pain.

10.1093/femsec/fiaf042,Foliar infections by Botrytis cinerea modulate the tomato root volatilome and microbiome.,"The fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea causes significant damage to aboveground plant parts, but its impact on root chemistry and microbiome composition is less understood. This study investigated how B. cinerea foliar infection influences the root volatilome and microbiome of two tomato genotypes: wild Solanum pimpinellifolium and domesticated Solanum lycopersicum var. Moneymaker. In the absence of infection, wild tomato roots emitted higher levels of monoterpenes such as α-pinene and terpinene compared to domesticated tomato roots. The fungal infection induced elevated levels of benzyl alcohol and benzofuran in the root headspace and/or rhizosphere of both genotypes, alongside genotype-specific changes. Multivariate analyses revealed that B. cinerea significantly altered bacterial and fungal community compositions in the rhizosphere and rhizoplane, with stronger bacterial community shifts in the rhizoplane. Taxa depletion and enrichment were observed, particularly among Proteobacteria and Ascomycota. Mantel tests showed significant correlations between rhizoplane bacterial community compositions and root-associated volatilome. Notably, enriched bacterial taxa such as Pelomonas and Comamonadaceae positively correlated with benzyl alcohol and benzofuran levels in the root volatilome. These findings demonstrate that B. cinerea foliar infection might induce profound changes in root-associated volatilome and microbiome composition, highlighting its systemic effects on plant root chemistry and microbiome composition.","The fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea causes significant damage to aboveground plant parts, but its impact on root chemistry and microbiome composition is less understood.

This systematic review analyzes data from previously reported cases of fungal pericarditis to provide an improved understanding of the etiology, clinical presentation, management, and outcomes of this rare disease. We reviewed Medline and Scopus databases from 1 January 1990 to 29 January 2024 for case reports that documented the isolation of a fungal pathogen from pericardial fluid or tissue. Of the 2330 articles screened, 101 cases met the inclusion criteria. Patients with fungal pericarditis and the involvement of at least one other organ-usually the lungs, brain, or kidney-had worse outcomes than patients with isolated pericardial disease. Immunosuppression was reported in 50% of cases and was associated with worse outcomes in adults. Patients who presented with chest pain, received adequate empiric antifungal therapy, and underwent pericardiocentesis and pericardiectomy had improved survival. The most common isolated pathogens were <i>Candida</i> spp., followed by <i>Aspergillus</i> spp. and <i>Mucor</i> spp., with the latter two linked to worse outcomes. Only 35% of patients received empiric antifungal medications before the causative pathogen was identified, and mortality was associated with a delay in appropriate therapy. Immunosuppression, disseminated disease, and presence of shock/multiorgan failure were additional risk factors associated with death. Fungal pericarditis carries a mortality rate of up to 50%, with nearly half of patients being immunocompromised. Clinicians frequently do not consider fungal pericarditis in the differential diagnoses, which leads to delays in treatment and poorer outcomes. Further prospective multicenter studies are urgently needed to better understand the epidemiology, improve diagnostic testing and management, and decrease unacceptably high mortality in patients with fungal pericarditis.","Fungal pericarditis is a rare disease but its incidence has risen in parallel with the global increase in invasive fungal infections.

10.7759/cureus.69340,The Efficacy and Safety of Antifungal Agents for Managing Oral Candidiasis in Oncologic Patients: A Systematic Review With Network Meta-Analysis.,"This study aimed at synthesizing the available evidence on the comparative safety and efficacy of antifungal agents for preventing or treating oral candidiasis (OC) in oncologic patients. A systematic review following international recommendations was performed (PROSPERO CRD42024507745). A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (Feb 2024) to retrieve randomized controlled trials evaluating the clinical effects of antifungal agents in the management of OC in this vulnerable population. Network meta-analyses were performed to evaluate the most prevalent outcomes, with findings reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Overall, 24 trials were included, of which 10 addressed OC treatment and 14 disease prophylaxis (n=3449 patients). Fluconazole had the most significant rates of clinical cure when compared to placebo (OR 0.09 [95% CI 0.01-0.69]), amphotericin B (0.21 [95% CI 0.07-0.65]) and itraconazole (OR 0.58 [95% CI 0.34-0.99]); ketoconazole was also superior to placebo for this outcome (OR 0.10 [95% CI 0.03, 0.36]). All antifungal agents presented significantly higher rates of prophylaxis success compared to the absence of an active agent. While these therapies were generally considered safe, only four studies provided data on adverse events, primarily related to gastrointestinal issues. In oncologic patients, azoles (fluconazole, ketoconazole) should be used as a first-line approach for OC treatment. The selection of antifungal agents for disease prophylaxis should consider, among others, patients' clinical characteristics and preferences. Economic and quality of life-related outcomes should be further addressed in future studies.","This study aimed at synthesizing the available evidence on the comparative safety and efficacy of antifungal agents for preventing or treating oral candidiasis (OC) in oncologic patients.

10.1186/s13567-025-01479-y,Transcriptomic analysis revealed ferroptosis in ducklings with splenic necrosis induced by NDRV infection.,"Infection with novel duck reovirus (NDRV) results in severe splenic necrosis, leading to immunosuppression, secondary infections with other pathogens, and impairment of the immune effect of the vaccine. However, little is known about NDRV-induced spleen injury and its antagonistic mechanism on the host immune response. In this study, we conducted pathological and comparative transcriptomic analyses of NDRV-infected duck spleens. Our findings elucidated the histopathological progression of splenic necrotic foci formation following NDRV infection and identified splenic macrophages as the primary target cells. RNA-Seq analysis revealed differentially expressed genes that were enriched predominantly in immune system processes, signalling molecules and interactions, and pathways related to cell growth and necrosis. Notably, we observed a significant upregulation of ferroptosis during NDRV infection, characterized by the induction of specific metabolism-related genes such as TfR1, Hmox1, and STEAP3, alongside the downregulation of Fpn expression. Our findings collectively indicate the involvement of ferroptosis in spleen injury induced by NDRV infection. Investigating the mechanism of NDRV-induced ferroptosis in spleen macrophages will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis associated with NDRV.","Infection with novel duck reovirus (NDRV) results in severe splenic necrosis, leading to immunosuppression, secondary infections with other pathogens, and impairment of the immune effect of the vaccine.

10.3390/tropicalmed9010008,The Impact of Antifungal Stewardship on Clinical and Performance Measures: A Global Systematic Review.,"<h4>Background</h4>Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) have been proposed as an opportunity to optimize antifungal use. The antifungal resistance is a significant and emerging threat. The literature on antifungal stewardship (AFS) and its influence on performance and clinical outcome measures is scarce. This study aimed to examine global evidence of the impact of AFS on patients and performance measures.<h4>Methods</h4>The ""Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses"" (PRISMA) was used for the flow of identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion. PubMed and MEDLINE were searched using the term ''antifungal stewardship'' on 15 February 2023. Search terms included antifungal stewardship, antimicrobial stewardship, candida, candidemia, candiduria, and invasive fungal disease. Of the 1366 records, 1304 were removed since they did not describe an antifungal stewardship intervention. Among the 62 full texts assessed, 21 articles were excluded since they were non-interventional studies and did not include the outcome of interest. Thus, 41 articles were eligible for systematic review. Eligible studies were those that described an AFS program and evaluated clinical or performance measures.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 41 included studies, the primary performance measure collected was antifungal consumption (22 of 41), and mortality (22 of 41), followed by length of stay (11 of 41) and cost (9 of 41). Most studies were single-center, quasi-experimental, with varying interventions across studies. The principal finding from most of the studies in this systematic review is a reduction in mortality expressed in different units and the use of antifungal agents (13 studies out of 22 reporting mortality). Antifungal consumption was significantly blunted or reduced following stewardship initiation (10 of 22). Comparing studies was impossible due to a lack of standard units, making conducting a meta-analysis unfeasible, which would be a limitation of our study.<h4>Conclusion</h4>It has been shown that AFS interventions may improve antifungal consumption and other performance measures. According to available published studies, antifungal consumption and mortality appear to be the possible performance measures to evaluate the impact of AFS.","<h4>Background</h4>Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) have been proposed as an opportunity to optimize antifungal use.

This study systematically reviews and conducts a meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 patients with fungal coinfections. The aim is to provide a concise overview of the impact of these infections on patient outcomes especially association with risk of mortality, informing future research and optimizing patient management strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>To identify relevant studies on COVID-19 patients, we conducted a systematic search of databases from the beginning of the year until July 2023, including fungal co-infections, mortality, and sequelae. Eligibility criteria were developed using the PICO framework, and data extraction was carried out separately by two authors using standard techniques. Statistical analysis was performed using the correlation model and differences between studies were evaluated using the I2 test. R and RStudio were used for statistical analysis and visualization.<h4>Results</h4>We initially identified 6,764 studies, and after checking for equivalence and consistency, 41 studies were included in the final analysis. The overall COVID-19 odds ratio for people who died from fungal infections was 2.65, indicating that patients infected with both COVID-19 and fungal infections had a higher risk of death compared to patients with COVID-19 alone. Specifically, COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) has a higher odds ratio of 3.36, while COVID-19-associated candidiasis (CAC) has an odds ratio of 1.84, and both are much more associated with death. However, coinfection of the fungus with other fungal species did not show a significant difference in the risk of mortality.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study identified CAPA and CAC as the most common infections acquired in healthcare settings.

10.3390/toxins17050227,Multi-Mycotoxin Contamination in Serbian Maize During 2021-2023: Climatic Influences and Implications for Food and Feed Safety.,"Mycotoxin contamination in maize poses significant food and feed safety risks, particularly in regions with variable climatic conditions like Serbia. This study investigated the occurrence of regulated mycotoxins in maize harvested across the Republic of Serbia from 2021 to 2023, emphasizing the impact of climatic factors. A total of 548 samples of unprocessed maize grains were analysed for the presence of key mycotoxins, including aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, fumonisins, and trichothecenes type A (T-2 and HT-2 toxins), using validated analytical methods. The results revealed high contamination frequencies, with aflatoxins and fumonisins being the most prevalent. The results revealed substantial temporal variability and frequent co-contamination of mycotoxins. Aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>) was the most concerning contaminant, with 73.2% of the samples in 2022 exceeding the European regulatory limit for human consumption (5 µg/kg) for un processed maize grains, reaching peak concentrations of 527 µg/kg, which is 105.4 times higher than the allowed limit. For animal feed, the limit of 20 µg/kg was exceeded in 40.5% of the samples, with the highest concentration being 26.4 times greater than the maximum allowable level. In 2021, the non-compliance rates for AFB<sub>1</sub> in food and feed were 8.3% and 2.3%, respectively, while in 2023, they were 23.2% and 12.2%, respectively. Fumonisins contamination was also high, particularly in 2021, with fumonisin B<sub>1</sub> (FB<sub>1</sub>) detected in 87.1% of samples and average concentrations reaching 4532 µg/kg. Although levels decreased in 2023 (70.7% occurrence, average 885 µg/kg), contamination remained significant. Deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination was consistently high (>70% of samples), with peak concentrations of 606 µg/kg recorded in 2021. Zearalenone (ZEN) and ochratoxin A (OTA) occurred less frequently, but ZEN levels peaked in 2022 at 357.6 µg/kg, which is above the regulatory limit of 350 µg/kg for food. Trichothecenes (HT-2 and T-2 toxins) were detected sporadically, with concentrations well below critical thresholds. Co-occurrence of mycotoxins was frequent, with significant mixtures detected, particularly between aflatoxins and fumonisins, as well as other fusarial toxins. The analysis demonstrated that temperature, humidity, and rainfall during both the growing and harvest seasons strongly influenced mycotoxin levels, with the most severe contamination occurring under specific climatic conditions. Notably, the highest mycotoxin levels, like aflatoxins, were linked to warmer temperatures and lower rainfall. The high non-compliance rates for aflatoxins and fumonisins and co-contamination pose significant food and feed safety risks. From a public health perspective, chronic exposure to contaminated maize increases the likelihood of carcinogenesis and reproductive disorders. Reduced productivity and bioaccumulation in animal tissues/products represent serious economic and safety concerns for livestock. This study provides insights into the potential risks to food and feed safety and the need for enhanced regulatory frameworks, continuous monitoring, and mitigation strategies in Serbia as well as other geographical regions.","Mycotoxin contamination in maize poses significant food and feed safety risks, particularly in regions with variable climatic conditions like Serbia.

A 65-year-old heart transplant male presented with left knee pain lasting 3 months. X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging identified a lesion with aggressive characteristics at the distal third of the left femur, due to which the patient underwent excisional surgery. <i>Aspergillus granulosus</i> was cultured from the removed material and antifungal treatment with oral isavuconazole was started. Chest imaging excluded pulmonary aspergillosis, while the positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) identified a remnant of a prosthetic vascular graft sewn to the proximal third of the right axillary artery, through which a catheter-based micro-axial left ventricular assist device was implanted previously as bridge to transplant therapy. The patient presented a rapid clinical improvement with complete functional recovery following the surgical treatment and the antifungal therapy and finally underwent surgical removal of the residual vascular graft.

However, ensuring effective fermentation during storage is crucial.<h4>Methods</h4>To address this, we systematically investigated the variations in fermentation quality, mycotoxin concentrations, and microbial community composition under different additive treatments. The treatments included CK (control, deionized water), LAB homo- and hetero-lactic acid bacteria: <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> and <i>Weissella confusa</i> MF01, and EN (cellulase), followed by 60 and 90 days of fermentation.<h4>Results</h4>The results indicated that both LAB and EN treatments significantly reduced the concentrations of deoxynivalenol (DON), aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>), and zearalenone (ZEN) compared to CK during the wet storage of high-moisture corn kernels. LAB treatment notably increased lactic and acetic acid levels, decreased pH and NH<sub>3</sub>-N content, and improved crude protein (CP, 8.24% DM) and starch content (73.01% DM) compared to CK. LAB treatment also reduced water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content (5.05% DM). Microbial diversity was reduced in the LAB treatment, as evidenced by decreases in both common and unique operational taxonomic units, while the relative abundance of <i>Weissella</i> increased after 60 days compared to CK. In contrast, despite higher lactic and acetic acid levels in the EN treatment, the pH did not decrease significantly due to higher NH<sub>3</sub>-N content. Overall, the LAB treatment outperformed other treatments by achieving lower mycotoxin concentrations, better fermentation quality, and superior preservation of nutritional components.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study provides valuable theoretical support and practical guidance for improving the wet storage of high-moisture corn kernels and enhancing their safety and nutritional value during storage.","<h4>Introduction</h4>The moisture content of corn kernels at harvest in China is relatively high, and wet storage effectively preserves high-moisture corn kernels.

10.1128/mbio.00583-24,Microsporidian coinfection reduces fitness of a fungal pathogen due to rapid host mortality.,"Infection outcomes can be strongly context dependent, shifting a host-symbiont relationship along a parasitism-mutualism continuum. Numerous studies show that under stressful conditions, symbionts that are typically mutualistic can become parasitic. The reverse possibility, a parasite becoming mutualistic, has received much less study. We investigated whether the parasitic microsporidium <i>Ordospora pajunii</i> can become beneficial for its host <i>Daphnia dentifera</i> in the presence of the more virulent fungal pathogen <i>Metschnikowia bicuspidata</i>. We found that, even though infection with <i>O. pajunii</i> reduces the frequency of penetration of <i>M. bicuspidata</i> spores into the host body cavity, it does not improve the survival or reproduction of the host; conversely, coinfection increased the mortality of <i>Daphnia</i>. This shorter lifespan of coinfected hosts disrupted the life cycle of <i>M. bicuspidata</i>, greatly reducing its fitness. Thus, coinfection with both pathogens was detrimental to the host at the individual level but might be beneficial for the host population as a result of greatly reduced production of <i>M. bicuspidata</i> spores. If so, this would mean that <i>O. pajunii</i> outbreaks should delay or prevent <i>M. bicuspidata</i> outbreaks. In support of this, in an analysis of dynamics of naturally occurring outbreaks in two lakes where these pathogens co-occur, we found a time lag in occurrence between <i>O. pajunii</i> and <i>M. bicuspidata</i>, with <i>M. bicuspidata</i> epidemics only occurring after the collapse of <i>O. pajunii</i> epidemics. Thus, these results suggest that the interaction between co-occurring symbionts, and the net impact of a symbiont on a host, might be qualitatively different at different scales.IMPORTANCEUnderstanding the factors that modify infection probability and virulence is crucial for identifying the drivers of infection outbreaks and modeling disease epidemic progression, and increases our ability to control diseases and reduce the harm they cause. One factor that can strongly influence infection probability and virulence is the presence of other pathogens. However, while coexposures and coinfections are incredibly common, we still have only a limited understanding of how pathogen interactions alter infection outcomes or whether their impacts are scale dependent. We used a system of one host and two pathogens to show that sequential coinfection can have a tremendous impact on the host and the infecting pathogens and that the outcome of (co-)infection can be negative or positive depending on the focal organization level.","Infection outcomes can be strongly context dependent, shifting a host-symbiont relationship along a parasitism-mutualism continuum.

EVs excel in biocompatibility and cell targeting, while liposomes offer enhanced drug loading capacity and scalability. The clinical translation of EVs is hindered by challenges including low yield and heterogeneity, whereas liposomes face rapid immune clearance and limited targeting efficiency. To bridge these gaps, biomimetic synthetic vesicles (SVs) have emerged as innovative platforms, combining the advantageous properties of EVs and liposomes. This review emphasizes critical aspects of EV biology, such as mechanisms of EV-cell interaction and source-dependent functionalities in targeting, immune modulation, and tissue regeneration, informing biomimetic SV engineering. We reviewed a broad array of biomimetic SVs, with a focus on lipid bilayered vesicles functionalized with proteins. These include cell-derived nanovesicles, protein-functionalized liposomes, and hybrid vesicles. By addressing current challenges and highlighting opportunities, this review aims to advance biomimetic SVs for transformative biomedical applications.","Naturally occurring extracellular vesicles (EVs) and synthetic nanoparticles like liposomes have revolutionized precision diagnostics and medicine.

Currently, invasive aspergillosis (IA) is the most common invasive fungal infection in patients with hematologic malignancies, with high rates of mortality and morbidity. The multifactorial nature of the disease requires appropriate risk stratification to enable the most appropriate preventive measures to be adapted and implemented according to the characteristics of the patient. In this sense, the present research aims to identify recent risk factors and environmental control measures against invasive aspergillosis to establish preventive actions to reduce the incidence of invasive aspergillosis in hospitals. (2) Methods: We conducted a qualitative systematic review of the scientific literature on environmental risk factors and preventive measures for invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematologic malignancies. The Medline, Cochrane, and Scopus databases were consulted, following the PRISMA and STROBE guidelines. (3) Results: Adequate implementation of environmental control measures is presented as the most efficient intervention in terms of prevention to decrease the incidence of invasive aspergillosis in hospitals. Neutropenia, fungal contamination, insufficient environmental control measures in hospital and home settings, length of hospital stay, and anemia, are identified as independent risk factors. We show that HEPA, LAF, and Plasmair<sup>®</sup> systems are suitable methods to reduce the concentration of airborne fungal spores. Antifungal prophylaxis did not significantly influence IA reduction in our study. (4) Conclusions: Proper professional training and environmental control measures in hospitals are essential for the prevention of invasive aspergillosis. We should optimize risk stratification for patients with hematologic malignancies. Antifungal prophylaxis should be complementary to environmental control measures and should never be substituted for the latter. Studies should also be undertaken to evaluate the efficiency of environmental control measures against IA at patients' homes.","(1) Background: <i>Aspergillus</i> spp. is a widely distributed filamentous fungus in the environment due to its high sporulation capacity.

The persistence and evolution of multidrug-resistant bacteria intensifies the urgency for alternative treatments. This review explores bacteriophage (phage) therapy as an innovative solution to combat bacterial LRTIs. Phages, abundant in nature, demonstrate specificity towards bacteria, minimal eukaryotic toxicity, and the ability to penetrate and disrupt bacterial biofilms, offering a targeted approach to infection control. The article synthesises evidence from systematic literature reviews spanning 2000-2023, <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies, case reports and ongoing clinical trials. It highlights the synergistic potential of phage therapy with antibiotics, the immunophage synergy in animal models, and the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics critical for clinical application. Despite promising results, the article acknowledges that phage therapy is at a nascent stage in clinical settings, the challenges of phage-resistant bacteria, and the lack of comprehensive cost-effectiveness studies. It stresses the need for further research to optimise phage therapy protocols and navigate the complexities of phage-host interactions, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and immunocompromised. We call for regulatory adjustments to facilitate the exploration of the long-term effects of phage therapy, aiming to incorporate this old-yet-new therapy into mainstream clinical practice to tackle the looming AMR crisis.","Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) present a significant global health burden, exacerbated by the rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

This review explores bacteriophage (phage) therapy as an innovative solution to combat bacterial LRTIs. Phages, abundant in nature, demonstrate specificity towards bacteria, minimal eukaryotic toxicity, and the ability to penetrate and disrupt bacterial biofilms, offering a targeted approach to infection control. The article synthesises evidence from systematic literature reviews spanning 2000-2023, <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies, case reports and ongoing clinical trials. It highlights the synergistic potential of phage therapy with antibiotics, the immunophage synergy in animal models, and the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics critical for clinical application. Despite promising results, the article acknowledges that phage therapy is at a nascent stage in clinical settings, the challenges of phage-resistant bacteria, and the lack of comprehensive cost-effectiveness studies. It stresses the need for further research to optimise phage therapy protocols and navigate the complexities of phage-host interactions, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and immunocompromised. We call for regulatory adjustments to facilitate the exploration of the long-term effects of phage therapy, aiming to incorporate this old-yet-new therapy into mainstream clinical practice to tackle the looming AMR crisis.",EuropePMC
10.1007/s00431-023-05295-4,"Position statement on infection screening, prophylaxis, and vaccination of pediatric patients with rheumatic diseases and immunosuppressive therapies, part 3: precautions in situations of surgery, fever, and opportunistic infections.","The objective of this study is to provide practical recommendations on the management of pediatric patients with immune-mediated rheumatic diseases receiving immunosuppressive therapies. The recommendations specifically address the cases of surgery, fever, and opportunistic infections (varicella, herpes-zoster, tuberculosis, invasive fungal disease). A qualitative approach was applied. A narrative literature review was performed via Medline. Primary searches were conducted using MeSH terms and free text to identify publications on infections and vaccinations in pediatric patients with immune-mediated rheumatic diseases receiving immunosuppressive therapies. The results were presented and discussed in a nominal group meeting, comprising a committee of 12 pediatric rheumatologists from the Infection Prevention and Treatment Working Group of the Spanish Society of Pediatric Rheumatology. Several recommendations were generated. A consensus procedure was implemented via a Delphi process; this was extended to members of the Spanish Society of Pediatric Rheumatology and Spanish Society of Pediatric Infectious Disease of the Spanish Association of Pediatrics. Participants produced a score ranging from 0 (totally disagree) to 10 (totally agree). Agreement was defined as a vote ≥ 7 by at least 70% of participants. The literature review included more than 400 articles. Overall, 63 recommendations (19 on surgery, fever, and opportunistic infections) were generated and voted by 59 pediatric rheumatologists and other pediatric specialists. Agreement was reached for all 63 recommendations. The recommendations on special situations cover management in cases of surgery, fever, and opportunistic infections (varicella, herpes-zoster, tuberculosis, and invasive fungal disease).  Conclusions: Hereby, we provided consensus and updated of recommendations about the management of special situations such as surgery, fever, and opportunistic in children with immune-mediated rheumatic diseases receiving immunosuppressive therapies. Several of the recommendations depend largely on clinical judgement and specific balance between risk and benefit for each individual and situation. To assess this risk, the clinician should have knowledge of the drugs, the patient's previous situation as well as the current infectious disease, in addition to experience. What is Known: • Infectious diseases and related complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with immune-mediated rheumatic diseases. • Information on how to manage the treatment in situations of fever, opportunistic infections, and surgery in children is limited, and guidelines for action are often extrapolated from adults. What is New: • In the absence of strong evidence, a literature review and a Delphi survey were conducted to establish a series of expert recommendations that could support the clinical practice, providing a practical and simple day-to-day approach to be used by pediatric rheumatologists.","The objective of this study is to provide practical recommendations on the management of pediatric patients with immune-mediated rheumatic diseases receiving immunosuppressive therapies.

Achieving optimal therapeutic concentrations of posaconazole can be challenging due to interpatient variability, the availability of multiple formulations, and various dosing strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies evaluating factors that influence blood concentrations of posaconazole. The primary outcome was the assessment of posaconazole concentrations in relation to various influencing factors, including age, sex, drug interactions, disease state, administered dose, and formulation.<h4>Results</h4>Our analysis included 46 studies involving a total of 8,505 patients. Co-administration of drugs that affect posaconazole metabolism significantly reduced its concentrations. High-fat meals, age, and sex did not have a significant impact on posaconazole oral suspension (POS) concentrations. Diarrhea substantially decreased concentrations of both delayed-release tablets (DRT) and POS. Neither vomiting nor mucositis significantly affected POS concentrations. Acid-suppressing agents, such as H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors, notably decreased POS concentrations but had no significant effect on DRT. Comparative studies of different dosage forms revealed significantly higher concentrations with DRT compared to POS.<h4>Conclusion</h4>DRT maintain more stable concentrations than POS and are not affected by acid-suppressing drugs.

10.1093/jee/toae217,The role of maize sap beetles (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) and maize weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in the spread of Aspergillus flavus in pre-harvest maize in Kenya.,"The spread of toxigenic Aspergillus into maize by insects and the subsequent aflatoxin contamination poses a risk to humans and animals and has been investigated in North and South America. To evaluate this effect in an African context, Greenhouse studies were conducted in 2022 to determine the role of sap beetles, Carpophilus dimidiatus Fabricius, 1792 (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) and maize weevils, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky, 1855 (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) on infection of maize kernels by Aspergillus flavus Link and the resultant aflatoxin accumulation. To test the beetles' efficacy, treatments were applied on partially opened primary ears at 3 different stages of kernel development (BBCH 75, 83, and 87). The treatments were: (i) distilled water, (ii) water with A. flavus spores, (iii) maize grits, (iv) maize grits with A. flavus spores, (v) C. dimidiatus, (vi) C. dimidiatus with A. flavus spores, (vii) S. zeamais, and (viii) S. zeamais with A. flavus spores. Data on kernel infection, maize rotting, yield, and aflatoxin content in kernels were collected. The highest kernel spoilage and yield loss were recorded for the co-inoculation of S. zeamais and A. flavus spores, followed by S. zeamais without A. flavus spores, and then C. dimidiatus with the fungal spores. Inoculation of maize at the BBCH 83 growth stage resulted in the highest kernel damage and aflatoxin contamination. S. zeamais and, to a lesser extent, C. dimidiatus effectively spread the A. flavus inoculum into non-wounded ears, resulting in fungal and aflatoxin contamination. The yield loss from S. zeamais-Aspergillus co-inoculation occurred due to the grain rotting and actual feeding of the maize weevils. Thus, insect management is important in reducing pre-harvest contamination of maize with mycotoxigenic fungi and their resultant toxins.","The spread of toxigenic Aspergillus into maize by insects and the subsequent aflatoxin contamination poses a risk to humans and animals and has been investigated in North and South America. To evaluate this effect in an African context, Greenhouse studies were conducted in 2022 to determine the role of sap beetles, Carpophilus dimidiatus Fabricius, 1792 (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) and maize weevils, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky, 1855 (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) on infection of maize kernels by Aspergillus flavus Link and the resultant aflatoxin accumulation. To test the beetles' efficacy, treatments were applied on partially opened primary ears at 3 different stages of kernel development (BBCH 75, 83, and 87). The treatments were: (i) distilled water, (ii) water with A. flavus spores, (iii) maize grits, (iv) maize grits with A. flavus spores, (v) C. dimidiatus, (vi) C. dimidiatus with A. flavus spores, (vii) S. zeamais, and (viii) S. zeamais with A. flavus spores. Data on kernel infection, maize rotting, yield, and aflatoxin content in kernels were collected. The highest kernel spoilage and yield loss were recorded for the co-inoculation of S. zeamais and A. flavus spores, followed by S. zeamais without A. flavus spores, and then C. dimidiatus with the fungal spores. Inoculation of maize at the BBCH 83 growth stage resulted in the highest kernel damage and aflatoxin contamination. S. zeamais and, to a lesser extent, C. dimidiatus effectively spread the A. flavus inoculum into non-wounded ears, resulting in fungal and aflatoxin contamination. The yield loss from S. zeamais-Aspergillus co-inoculation occurred due to the grain rotting and actual feeding of the maize weevils.

10.3390/pharmaceutics16121584,Nanomedicines for Pulmonary Drug Delivery: Overcoming Barriers in the Treatment of Respiratory Infections and Lung Cancer.,"The pulmonary route for drug administration has garnered a great deal of attention in therapeutics for treating respiratory disorders. It allows for the delivery of drugs directly to the lungs and, consequently, the maintenance of high concentrations at the action site and a reduction in systemic adverse effects compared to other routes, such as oral or intravenous. Nevertheless, the pulmonary administration of drugs is challenging, as the respiratory system tries to eliminate inhaled particles, being the main responsible mucociliary escalator. Nanomedicines represent a primary strategy to overcome the limitations of this route as they can be engineered to prolong pulmonary retention and avoid their clearance while reducing drug systemic distribution and, consequently, systemic adverse effects. This review analyses the use of pulmonary-administered nanomedicines to treat infectious diseases affecting the respiratory system and lung carcinoma, two pathologies that represent major health threats.","The pulmonary route for drug administration has garnered a great deal of attention in therapeutics for treating respiratory disorders.

However, its mechanism of immune regulation in fungal keratitis has not been thoroughly studied. Our study is aimed at clarifying the role of galectin-3 in the fungal keratitis mouse model in vivo, thereby providing a new biomarker of antifungal therapy. In our study, aspergillus, the most common pathogenic fungi of fungal keratitis, was identified and isolated by corneal tissue fungus culture. Then, the RNA expression levels of galectin family members in corneas of the mouse model with aspergillus fumigatus keratitis were screened by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). The expression of the galectin-3 was detected by quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunofluorescence in the corneal tissue of the fungal keratitis mouse model. Recruitment of neutrophils and the co-immunofluorescence of galectin-3 and related markers in corneal tissue were determined by flow cytometry analysis and immunofluorescence staining. The regulatory role of galectin-3 for proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophils was validated by the knockout mouse model. Galectin-3 knockout deteriorated the condition for the inhibition of galectin-3 was benefecial for fungi to survive and thrive in corneal lesions. These results demonstrated that in the ocular fungal infection, galectin-3 is capable of regulating the pathogenesis of fungal keratitis by modulating neutrophil recruitment. The deterioration of fungal keratitis and increased fungal load in corneal lesions of galectin-3 knockout mice proved the regulatory role of galectin-3 in fungal keratitis.

10.7759/cureus.50014,Quad Zygoma: A Graftless Solution in Post-mucormycosis Maxillectomy.,"Mucormycosis, a fungal infection that commonly affects individuals with diabetes and compromised immune systems, often requires surgical excision and debridement. However, this can result in significant defects, posing a challenge for clinicians in terms of reconstruction and rehabilitation. Prostheses, local and regional pedicled flaps with or without bone grafts, and titanium mesh application are available options for maxillary reconstruction. Soft-tissue flaps are not sufficient to provide osseointegrated implants with both bone repair and structural support, which emphasises the quad zygoma's beneficial role in treating maxillary abnormalities. Patients benefit from quad zygoma, which uses zygomatic implants and eliminates the need for subsequent procedures, which shortens the course of treatment and lowers costs. Because zygomatic implants are securely fixed into the zygoma, temporary prostheses can be loaded right away. Then, four to six months later, a fixed prosthesis may be introduced. Clinical results with zygomatic implants often surpass those of bone grafting, representing a potential novel gold-standard approach for the compromised maxilla. This case report details the rehabilitation of post-mucormycosis patients with maxillary defects using quad zygomatic implants. The absence of complications during follow-up, conducted at 15, 30, 45, and 90 days, and subsequently monthly for two years, highlights the success of this approach. Evaluation parameters included soft tissue recovery, infection, wound separation, stability of prosthesis, eating effectiveness, and aesthetic outcomes. The positive outcomes observed at follow-up appointment emphasize the viability and effectiveness of quad zygomatic implants in addressing maxillary defects post-mucormycosis.","Mucormycosis, a fungal infection that commonly affects individuals with diabetes and compromised immune systems, often requires surgical excision and debridement.

One emerging fungal pathogen, Ophidiomyces ophidiicola, is well documented as the causative agent of ophidiomycosis, otherwise known as snake fungal disease (SFD). O. ophidiicola has been found to cause disease in a variety of snake species across the United States, including the eastern massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus), a federally threatened rattlesnake species. Most work to date has involved detecting O. ophidiicola for diagnosis of infection through direct sampling of snakes, and attempts to detect O. ophidiicola in the abiotic environment to better understand its distribution, seasonality, and habitat associations are lacking. We collected topsoil and groundwater samples from four macrohabitat types across multiple seasons in northern Michigan at a site where Ophidiomyces infection has been confirmed in eastern massasauga. Using a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay developed for O. ophidiicola, we detected Ophidiomyces DNA in topsoil but observed minimal to no detection in groundwater samples. Detection frequency did not differ between habitats, but samples grouped seasonally showed higher detection during mid-summer. We found no relationships of detection with hypothesized environmental correlates such as soil pH, temperature, or moisture content. Furthermore, the distribution of Ophidiomyces positive samples across the site was not linked to estimated space use of massasaugas. Our data suggests that season has some effect on the presence of Ophidiomyces. Differences in presence between habitats may exist but are likely more dependent on the time of sampling and currently uninvestigated soil or biotic parameters.

Treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings with plant EVs delayed the progression of fungal infection by altering fungal germ tube development and fungal morphology. Significantly, extracellular RNAs, including miRNAs and siRNAs, did not co-fractionate with TET8-labeled EVs, and instead, co-fractionated with extravesicular ARGONAUTE proteins in high-density fractions.

Significantly, extracellular RNAs, including miRNAs and siRNAs, did not co-fractionate with TET8-labeled EVs, and instead, co-fractionated with extravesicular ARGONAUTE proteins in high-density fractions. Together, these data indicate that Arabidopsis EVs are highly heterogeneous and contribute to immunity but are unlikely to mediate cross-kingdom RNA interference.",EuropePMC
10.1128/mbio.01541-24,The conserved role of miR-2 and novel miR-109 in the increase in fecundity of <i>Diaphorina citri</i> induced by symbiotic bacteria and pathogenic fungi.,"Infection with pathogens can increase the fecundity and other fitness-related traits of insect vectors for their own advantage. Our previous research has reported the pivotal role of <i>DcKr-h1</i> in the fecundity improvement of <i>Diaphorina citri</i> induced by the bacterium, ""<i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter asiaticus"" (<i>C</i>Las), and the fungus, <i>Cordyceps fumosorosea</i> (<i>Cf</i>). However, the posttranscriptional regulation of this process remains poorly understood. Given the significance of miRNAs in gene regulation, we delved into their roles in shaping phenotypes and their underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results indicated that two miRNAs, miR-2 and novel-miR-109, jointly inhibited <i>DcKr-h1</i> expression by binding to its 3' untranslated region (UTR). In the <i>D. citri-C</i>Las interaction, the expression levels of miR-2 and novel-miR-109 in the ovaries of <i>C</i>Las-positive psyllids were lower compared to <i>C</i>Las-negative individuals. Overexpression of miR-2 or novel-miR-109 significantly decreased fecundity and <i>C</i>Las titer in ovaries and caused reproductive defects reminiscent of <i>DcKr-h1</i> knockdown. Similarly, in the <i>D. citri-Cf</i> interaction, the levels of miR-2 and novel-miR-109 markedly decreased in the ovaries. Upregulation of miR-2 or novel-miR-109 also resulted in reduced fecundity and ovary defects similar to those caused by <i>DcKr-h1</i> silencing. Moreover, feeding antagomir-2 or antagomir-109 partially rescued the defective phenotypes caused by <i>DcKr-h1</i> silencing in both model systems, and miR-2 and novel-miR-109 were repressed by juvenile hormone (JH) and regulated the genes associated with egg development. This study shows a conserved regulatory mechanism, whereby JH suppresses the expression of miR-2 and novel-miR-109 which, together with JH-induced transcription of <i>DcKr-h1</i>, increases female fecundity induced by both symbiotic bacteria and pathogenic fungi.<h4>Importance</h4>Infection with pathogens can increase the fecundity and other fitness-related traits of insect vectors for their own advantage.

10.3390/ijms26062764,Exploring a Role for the Arabidopsis TIR-X Gene (TIRP) in the Defense Against Pathogenic Fungi or Insect Herbivory Attack.,"Plants are challenged regularly with multiple types of biotic stress factors, such as pathogens or insect herbivores, in their environment. To detect and defend against pathogens, plants have evolved an innate immune system in which intracellular receptors in the so-called effector-triggered immunity play a vital role. In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> the Toll/interleukin-1 receptors (TIRs) domain is related to intracellular immunity receptors, for example in TIR-NBS-LRR (TNL) proteins. Among the TIR domain carrying proteins, very little is known about the function of the TIR-X proteins. Here, we focus on the recently described TIR-X (TIRP; At5g44900) to analyze its role in phytohormone-mediated plant defense through gene expression and phytohormone quantification. Therefore, we employed two fungal pathogens, the necrotrophic <i>Alternaria brassicicola</i> and the hemibiotrophic <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>, to infect <i>A. thaliana</i> WT (Col-0), TIRP knock-out, and TIRP overexpressing lines for comparative analyses. Furthermore, we included the insect herbivore <i>Spodoptera littoralis</i> and a treatment with <i>S. littoralis</i> egg extract on the plants to analyze any role of TIRP during these attacks. We found that both <i>A. brassicicola</i> and <i>V. dahliae</i> infections increased TIRP gene expression systemically. The salicylic acid content was higher in the TIRP overexpressing line, corresponding to a better <i>S. littoralis</i> larval growth performance in feeding assays. However, since we never observed clear infection-related differences in jasmonate or salicylic acid levels between the wild type and the two transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> lines, our results rule out the possibility that TIRP acts via the regulation of phytohormone synthesis and accumulation.","Plants are challenged regularly with multiple types of biotic stress factors, such as pathogens or insect herbivores, in their environment.

We evaluated the effects of symbiotic bacteria Caballeronia insecticola on its host Riptortus pedestris (Fabricus) (Hemiptera: Alydidae) from cohorts for nymphal development, adult survivorship, and female reproduction. Then, life table parameters were compared between symbiotic and apo-symbiotic groups, and the effects of symbiosis on the abundance of R. pedestris were simulated for varying proportions of symbiotic individuals in host populations. We found that symbiosis significantly accelerated the nymphal development and reproductive maturation of females. However, symbiosis incurred survival cost on adult females, reducing their longevity by 28.6%. Nonetheless, symbiotic females laid significantly greater numbers of eggs than the apo-symbiotic during early adult ages. This early reproductive investment negated the adverse effect of their reduced longevity, resulting in the mean lifetime fecundity to not significantly differ between the 2 groups. Indeed, total cohort fecundity of the symbiotic group was 1.3-fold greater than that of the apo-symbiotic group. Life table analysis demonstrated shorter generation time and greater population growth rate in the symbiotic population. Finally, the simulation model results indicate that an increase in the proportion of symbiotic R. pedestris favored the population growth, increasing the population size by 1.9 times for every 25% increase in the proportion of symbiotic individuals. Our study demonstrates that symbiont-mediated changes in the life history parameters of host individuals favor the host population growth, despite substantial reduction in the female longevity.","This study aimed to investigate the effects of symbiosis on the life history of host insects and address their implications at the host population level.

10.1371/journal.ppat.1011775,Manipulating multi-level selection in a fungal entomopathogen reveals social conflicts and a method for improving biocontrol traits.,"Changes in parasite virulence are commonly expected to lead to trade-offs in other life history traits that can affect fitness. Understanding these trade-offs is particularly important if we want to manipulate the virulence of microbial biological control agents. Theoretically, selection across different spatial scales, i.e. between- and within-hosts, shapes these trade-offs. However, trade-offs are also dependent on parasite biology. Despite their applied importance the evolution of virulence in fungal parasites is poorly understood: virulence can be unstable in culture and commonly fails to increase in simple passage experiments. We hypothesized that manipulating selection intensity at different scales would reveal virulence trade-offs in a fungal pathogen of aphids, Akanthomyces muscarius. Starting with a genetically diverse stock we selected for speed of kill, parasite yield or infectivity by manipulating competition within and between hosts and between-populations of hosts over 7 rounds of infection. We characterized ancestral and evolved lineages by whole genome sequencing and by measuring virulence, growth rate, sporulation and fitness. While several lineages showed increases in virulence, we saw none of the trade-offs commonly found in obligately-killing parasites. Phenotypically similar lineages within treatments often shared multiple single-nucleotide variants, indicating strong convergent evolution. The most dramatic phenotypic changes were in timing of sporulation and spore production in vitro. We found that early sporulation led to reduced competitive fitness but could increase yield of spores on media, a trade-off characteristic of social conflict. Notably, the selection regime with strongest between-population competition and lowest genetic diversity produced the most consistent shift to early sporulation, as predicted by social evolution theory. Multi-level selection therefore revealed social interactions novel to fungi and showed that these biocontrol agents have the genomic flexibility to improve multiple traits-virulence and spore production-that are often in conflict in other parasites.","Changes in parasite virulence are commonly expected to lead to trade-offs in other life history traits that can affect fitness.

Pathologically, ROCM and ENKTL-NT share the same characteristics of inflammation, necrosis, and granuloma. ROCM is characterized by the detection of fungi in tissue, while ENKTL-NT is typically positive for NK/T-cell markers and cytotoxic granule-associated proteins, proliferation, and vascular damage of angioinvasion, which could be incited by <i>Mucor irregularis</i> and <i>Rhizopus arrhizus</i> in patients and mice.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ENKTL-NT and ROCM share many similarities in clinical presentations, radiology, and histopathology, and might have the same etiology. This may explain why the two diseases are tangled together in the reported cases, and suggests the role that the fungi may play in the development of these ENKTL-NT/ROCM diseases. The reason why ENKTL-NT and ROCM are sometimes confused is that the main pathogens of ROCM, <i>Mucor irregularis</i> and <i>Rhizopus arrhizus</i>, are the fungal causative agents of ENKTL-NT.","<h4>Background</h4>Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type is a syndrome of middle face destruction with an association to Epstein-Barr virus. Fungi have been recovered from the diseased tissue now and then but were often seen as a lymphoma-associated secondary infection. However, there are ENKTL-NT cases with the recoveries of fungi and complete recovery with antifungal therapy, which are quite similar to rhino-orbital-cerebral mycosis (ROCM) that often confuses the physicians.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched Medline for English-language manuscripts limited to ""human"" and ""case reports,"" ""letters,"" ""reviews,"" and ""clinical conferences"" from 1966 to 2022. We used MeSH terms ""lymphoma, extranodal nk-t-cell"" [MeSH Terms] or ""lethal midline granuloma"" [MeSH Terms], in combination with MeSH terms ""microbiology"" [subheading] or ""microbiology"" [all fields] or ""fungi"" [all fields] or ""fungi"" [MeSH Terms] for ENKTL-NT with infections. We used MeSH terms ""Mycoses"" in combination with ""Nose"" [Mesh] OR ""Orbital Diseases"" [Mesh] for rhino-orbital-cerebral fungal infections.<h4>Results</h4>We appraised 149 included articles and extracted references related to ENKTL-NT and/or ROCM. Themes and subcategories were subsequently derived. Our findings revealed that ROCM and ENKTL-NT are characterized by progressive and destructive ulcers in the midline face or rhino-orbital structures.

10.1021/acsnano.4c11686,Robotic Microcapsule Assemblies with Adaptive Mobility for Targeted Treatment of Rugged Biological Microenvironments.,"Microrobots are poised to transform biomedicine by enabling precise, noninvasive procedures. However, current magnetic microrobots, composed of solid monolithic particles, present fundamental challenges in engineering intersubunit interactions, limiting their collective effectiveness in navigating irregular biological terrains and confined spaces. To address this, we design hierarchically assembled microrobots with multiaxis mobility and collective adaptability by engineering the potential magnetic interaction energy between subunits to create stable, self-reconfigurable structures capable of carrying and protecting cargo internally. Using double emulsion templates and magnetic control techniques, we confine 10 nm iron oxide and 15 nm silica nanoparticles within the shell of 100 μm microcapsules that form multiunit robotic collectives. Unexpectedly, we find that asymmetric localization of iron oxide nanoparticles in the microcapsules enhances the intercapsule potential energy, creating stable connections under rotating magnetic fields without altering the magnetic susceptibility. These robotic microcapsule collectives exhibit emergent behaviors, self-reconfiguring into kinematic chain-like structures to traverse complex obstacles, arched confinements, and adhesive, rugged biological tissues that typically impede microscale systems. By harnessing these functions, we demonstrate targeted antifungal delivery using a localized biofilm model on mucosal tissues, showing effective killing of<i>Candida</i> without binding or causing physical damage to host cells. Our findings show how hierarchical assembly can produce cargo-carrying microrobots with collective, self-adaptive mobility for traversing complex biological environments, advancing targeted delivery for biomedical applications.","Microrobots are poised to transform biomedicine by enabling precise, noninvasive procedures.

It has remained a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in Africa despite the extensive rollout of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study aimed to systematically synthesize the evidence on the prevalence of CM among people living with HIV (PLWH) and its predictors of mortality among adults who are on induction antifungal therapy in Africa.<h4>Methods</h4>PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched for randomized clinical trials or observational studies published in Africa from 1995 to April 2021. Pooled prevalence of CM among PLWH was calculated using R-studio Version 1.4.1717 software and the data extracted from eligible studies were pooled as percentage with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Predictors of mortality among adults on induction antifungal therapy were synthesized narratively.<h4>Results</h4>Out of 364 studies identified, 17 eligible articles were included in the analysis. The prevalence of CM among PLWH in Africa was 5.11% (95% CI 2.71-9.43%; participants = 10,813; studies = 9; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 97%). In the subgroup analysis, the prevalence was 12.9% (95% CI 4.883-30.0; participants = 533; studies = 3; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 63%) in the years 1995-2010 and 3.18% (95% CI 1.54-6.45; participants = 10,280; studies = 6; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 98%) in the years 2011-2021, with the prevalence significantly decreased by 51% (<i>p</i> = <i>0.02</i>). Predictors of mortality were fluconazole monotherapy, focal neurological signs, low Glasgow coma scale, and delayed diagnosis of CM at varied timepoint.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Prevalence of CM has significantly decreased from 1996-2010 to 2011-2021 among PLWH on induction therapy in Africa. Fluconazole monotherapy, focal neurological symptoms, diastolic blood pressure < 60 mmHg, and concurrent tuberculosis coinfection were significant predictors of mortality at 2- and 10-weeks timepoints.

Pulmonary TB can lead to life-threatening respiratory failure necessitating extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. However, data on ECMO experience in the management of TB patients are scarce.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a systematic review of the literature using the search terms ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, TB and tuberculosis in three databases (Medline, Web of Science and EMBASE). Clinical data were extracted by two independent investigators. Clinical parameters, such as mode of ECMO therapy, duration of treatment and clinical outcomes, were assessed.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 43 patients from 15 countries were included in the analysis. The age ranged from 0 to 65 years, 39.5% were male, and 60.5% were female. The majority of patients suffered from ARDS (83.4%), with a mean Horovitz quotient of 68.1 (range 30.0-131.0). 83.7% received VV-ECMO, and 24.3% received VA-ECMO. Coinfections and complications were frequently observed (45.5% and 48.6% respectively). At the end of the respective observation period, the overall outcome was excellent, with 81.4% survival.<h4>Discussion</h4>ECMO therapy in TB patients appears to be a feasible therapeutic option, providing a bridge until antimycobacterial therapy takes effect. As the underlying cause is reversible, we advocate for the evaluation of ECMO usage in these patients with acute cardiac or respiratory failure.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Tuberculosis (TB) is still a major contributor to the global health burden.

While CFEM proteins have been extensively characterized in phytopathogens, their presence and functions in <i>Fusarium verticillioides</i> remained unexplored. Here, we systematically identified 19 CFEM-containing proteins in <i>F. verticillioides</i>, among which FvCFEM12 exhibited secretory activity and plant infection-induced expression. Functional characterization revealed that FvCFEM12 suppressed Bax- and INF1-triggered cell death in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves. Furthermore, heterologous expression of FvCFEM12 in maize leaves using <i>P. syringae</i> strain D36E can compromise immune responses against bacterial pathogens. Deletion of FvCFEM12 impaired fungal virulence, altered hyphal morphology, and reduced cell wall stress tolerance. Interestingly, FvCFEM12 physically interacted with the maize wall-associated receptor kinase ZmWAK17ET, and targeted silencing of ZmWAK17 in maize enhanced susceptibility to <i>F. verticillioides</i>. Our findings revealed that FvCFEM12 is a dual-function effector that suppresses plant immunity and maintains fungal cell wall integrity, thereby orchestrating fungal pathogenicity at the host-pathogen interface.","Common in Fungal Extracellular Membrane (CFEM) effectors, a unique class of fungal-specific proteins, play critical roles in host-pathogen interactions.

10.1111/plb.13744,The roles of florivory and herbivory in maintaining intra-population flower colour variation in Anemone coronaria.,"Most flowering plants are colour monomorphic, while within-population flower colour variation is rare. Multiple selection agents on flower colour, each favouring a different colour morph, may drive such uncommon polymorphisms. We tested the role of biotic antagonistic interactions in maintaining flower colour variation in Anemone coronaria (Ranunculaceae), in colour-polymorphic populations comprised of red, purple, and white flowers. We estimated the extent of leaf herbivory and petal florivory in each flower colour morph in three populations over two flowering seasons. We categorized types of damage to four groups of herbivores and estimated the plant maternal fitness. We tested pollinator response to different levels (0-30%) of simulated florivory in experimental flower arrays. Leaf and petal damage did not differ between white- and purple-flowering plants. Red-flowering plants had higher leaf damage than white-flowering plants and higher petal damage than purple-flowering plants. Nevertheless, all colour morphs had similar fitness. Red flowers exhibited more petal scratches (attributed to glaphyrid beetles), but fewer petal bites (attributed to caterpillars or grasshoppers), than white and purple flowers. Experimentally induced florivory did not reduce visits by potential pollinators in any colour morph. Glaphyrid beetles are the major pollinators of red anemone flowers, suggesting that their service to red flowers as mutualists (pollinators) should be weighed against their disservice as antagonists (florivores). A balance between pollination service and petal scratch damage of red flowers, both mediated by Glaphyird beetles, may equalize fitness between the red and the purple/white colour morphs, contributing to colour polymorphism.","Most flowering plants are colour monomorphic, while within-population flower colour variation is rare.

Drug-resistant microbes contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in the hospital, especially in the critical care unit. The primary etiology of increasing antibiotic resistance is inappropriate and excessive use of antibiotics. The alarming rise of drug-resistant microbes worldwide threatens to erode our ability to treat infections with our current armamentarium of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the pace of development of new antibiotics by the pharmaceutical industry has not kept up with rising resistance to expand our options to treat microbial infections. The costs of antibiotic resistance include death and disability, extended hospital stays due to prolonged sickness, need for expensive therapies, rising healthcare expenditure, reduced productivity from time out of the workforce, and rising penury.

10.3390/plants14030456,Labile Carbon Input Mitigates the Negative Legacy Effects of Nitrogen Addition on Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiosis in a Temperate Grassland.,"Nitrogen (N) deposition and carbon (C) addition significantly influence the dynamics of plant-microbe interactions, particularly altering the symbiotic relationship between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of labile C input on the relationship between AMF and various plant species in a nitrogen-enriched environment remain a knowledge gap. A seven-year field experiment was conducted to examine how six levels of N and three levels of labile C addition impact AMF colonization in four key plant species: <i>Leymus chinensis</i> (Trin. ex Bunge) Tzvelev, <i>Stipa baicalensis</i> Roshev., <i>Thermopsis lanceolata</i> R. Br. and <i>Potentilla bifurca</i> Linn. Our results showed that N and C additions exert significantly different effects on the relationship between AMF and various plant species. Labile C addition mitigated historical N negative effects, particularly for <i>S. baicalensis</i>, enhancing AMF infection and promoting nutrient exchange under high-N and low-C conditions. The relationship between AMF and both <i>L. chinensis</i> and <i>T. lanceolata</i> changed to weak mutualism under low-N and high-C conditions, with significant decreases in vesicular and arbuscular abundance. Plant root stoichiometry plays a critical role in modulating AMF symbiosis, particularly under high-N and -C conditions, as reflected in the increased AMF infection observed in <i>T. lanceolata</i> and <i>P. bifurca</i>. Our findings emphasize the species-specific and nutrient-dependent AMF symbiosis, revealing that targeted C input can mitigate the legacy effects of N enrichment.

Here, using mouse models of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection and Alternaria alternata asthma, we show that sensory neurons are required for B cell recruitment and antibody production. In response to S. pneumoniae, sensory neuron depletion increases bacterial burden and reduces B cell numbers, IgG release, and neutrophil stimulation. Meanwhile, during A. alternata-induced airway inflammation, sensory neuron depletion decreases B cell population sizes, IgE levels, and asthmatic characteristics. Mechanistically, during bacterial infection, sensory neurons preferentially release vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). In response to asthma, sensory neurons release substance P. Administration of VIP into sensory neuron-depleted mice suppresses bacterial burden, while VIPR1 deficiency increases infection. Similarly, exogenous substance P delivery aggravates asthma in sensory neuron-depleted mice, while substance P deficiency ameliorates asthma. Our data, thus demonstrate that sensory neurons release select neuropeptides which target B cells dependent on the immunogen.","Sensory neurons sense pathogenic infiltration to drive innate immune responses, but their role in humoral immunity is unclear.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was conducted in the Science Direct, PUBMED, MEDLINE, and SciELO databases between 2011 and 2021 based on the dominant genotypic model of this SNP for general and subgroup analysis of infectious agent type in random effect. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for genotypic comparison. I<sup>2</sup> statistics were calculated to assess the presence of heterogeneity between studies and funnel plots were inspected for indication of publication bias. A total of 27 articles were included, all in English. Among the results achieved, the categories of diseases that were most associated with the SNP studied were in decreasing order of number of articles: infections by bacteria (29.63%); caused by viruses (22.23%); urinary tract infection-UTI (7.4%), while 11 studies (40.74%) demonstrated a nonsignificant association. In this meta-analysis, a total of 5599 cases and 5871 controls were finalized. The present meta-analysis suggests that there is no significant association between TLR4-rs4986790 SNP and infections (OR = 1,11; 95% CI: 0,75-1,66; <i>p</i> = 0,59), but in the virus subgroup it was associated with a higher risk (OR = 2,16; 95% CI: 1,09-4,30; <i>p</i> = 0,03). The subgroups of bacteria and parasites did not show statistical significance (OR = 0,86; 95% CI: 0,56-1,30; <i>p</i> = 0,47, and no estimate of effects, respectively).

10.1093/jme/tjae124,Evaluation of the In2care Mosquito Station against Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) under semifield conditions.,"Culex quinquefasciatus is an important mosquito vector responsible for the transmission of filarial worms, arthropod-borne viruses like Oropouche, St. Louis encephalitis, and West Nile and protozoans that cause avian malaria. Due to insecticide resistance documented in Cx. quinquefasciatus populations worldwide, integrated vector management programs can benefit from new strategies to control this species. The In2Care Mosquito Station (In2Care station), a commercially available dissemination station containing pyriproxyfen (PPF) and Beauveria bassiana spores, has been shown to be effective against skip-ovipositing Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus in previously conducted semifield and field trials. To determine the potential of Cx. quinquefasciatus adult females to autodisseminate PPF and if the In2Care station could be used for Cx. quinquefasciatus control, we assessed its efficacy in a semifield setting against wild Cx. quinquefasciatus. We found that the In2Care station was attractive to gravid Cx. quinquefasciatus females, with a significantly higher percentage of egg rafts laid in the In2Care station compared to alternative ovipots. Adult females successfully autodisseminated PPF from the In2Care station to surrounding ovipots, leading to a significant increase in mosquito emergence inhibition. Additionally, adult Cx. quinquefasciatus exposure to B. bassiana spores significantly reduced mosquito survivorship. These results suggest that the In2Care station may be effective against Cx. quinquefasciatus in addition to Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Additional field evaluations are needed to assess impacts at the population level.","Culex quinquefasciatus is an important mosquito vector responsible for the transmission of filarial worms, arthropod-borne viruses like Oropouche, St. Louis encephalitis, and West Nile and protozoans that cause avian malaria.

10.1093/mmy/myad132,Pichia kudriavzevii (Candida krusei): A systematic review to inform the World Health Organisation priority list of fungal pathogens.,"In response to the growing global threat of fungal infections, in 2020 the World Health Organisation (WHO) established an Expert Group to identify priority fungi and develop the first WHO fungal priority pathogen list (FPPL). The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the features and global impact of invasive infections caused by Pichia kudriavzevii (formerly known as Candida krusei). PubMed and Web of Science were used to identify studies published between 1 January 2011 and 18 February 2021 reporting on the criteria of mortality, morbidity (defined as hospitalisation and length of stay), drug resistance, preventability, yearly incidence, and distribution/emergence. Overall, 33 studies were evaluated. Mortality rates of up to 67% in adults were reported. Despite the intrinsic resistance of P. kudriavzevii to fluconazole with decreased susceptibility to amphotericin B, resistance (or non-wild-type rate) to other azoles and echinocandins was low, ranging between 0 and 5%. Risk factors for developing P. kudriavzevii infections included low birth weight, prior use of antibiotics/antifungals, and an underlying diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease or cancer. The incidence of infections caused by P. kudriavzevii is generally low (∼5% of all Candida-like blood isolates) and stable over the 10-year timeframe, although additional surveillance data are needed. Strategies targeting the identified risk factors for developing P. kudriavzevii infections should be developed and tested for effectiveness and feasibility of implementation. Studies presenting data on epidemiology and susceptibility of P. kudriavzevii were scarce, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Thus, global surveillance systems are required to monitor the incidence, susceptibility, and morbidity of P. kudriavzevii invasive infections to inform diagnosis and treatment. Timely species-level identification and susceptibility testing should be conducted to reduce the high mortality and limit the spread of P. kudriavzevii in healthcare facilities.","In response to the growing global threat of fungal infections, in 2020 the World Health Organisation (WHO) established an Expert Group to identify priority fungi and develop the first WHO fungal priority pathogen list (FPPL).

10.1002/ece3.70974,Living Away From Specialized Pollinators: The Pollination System of <i>Cieba Pentandra</i> in the Yucatan Peninsula.,"Plant-pollinator systems can exist along the gradient from extreme specialization to extreme generalization. Theoretical work predicts that high pollinator reliability may lead to specialized pollination systems, while pollinator unpredictability may promote generalized pollination systems. However, empirical tests of these predictions are constrained by the availability of accurate field observations, particularly in some groups of plants, such as trees pollinated by nocturnal animals. Plant species that face variable pollinator availability within their distributional range represent an ideal study system to address the effect of pollination predictability on the specialization level of pollination systems. This is the case of <i>Ceiba pentandra</i>, a tropical tree with chiropterophilic flowers. Most previous studies have described the pollination system of this tree species as mainly or exclusively bat-pollinated. Here we studied the pollination system of <i>C. pentandra</i> in the Yucatan Peninsula, a region where no species of specialized nectarivorous bats occur. We assessed quantity (visitation rate) and quality pollination components (pollen deposition, fruit/seed set) for diurnal and nocturnal visitors in two different locations and years. We expected to find a generalized pollination system due to the absence of specialized pollinators. As predicted, we found five functional groups of nocturnal and diurnal pollinators. Diurnal and nocturnal pollinators contributed to a similar extent to quantity (visitation rate) and quality pollination components (fruit & seed set). However, the contribution of diurnal and nocturnal pollinators also varied either spatially or temporally. We conclude that the pollination system of <i>C. pentandra</i> in the Yucatan Peninsula is highly generalized and that temporal and/or spatial unpredictability in the effectiveness of its pollinators may explain this finding.","Plant-pollinator systems can exist along the gradient from extreme specialization to extreme generalization.

10.1159/000526785,The Need of Antimicrobial Stewardship in Post-Operative Infectious Complications of Abdominal Surgery.,"<h4>Background</h4>Post-operative infection is a common complication following abdominal surgery. The two most common infections are secondary peritonitis and surgical site infections, which lead to increased perioperative morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, higher mortality rates, and increased treatment costs. In addition to surgical procedures, treatment is based on effective antibiotic therapy. Due to increasing antimicrobial resistance, the correct use of antimicrobials is becoming more complex. Many initiatives call for the implementation of an antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programme to optimize anti-infective therapy. The review article summarizes current recommendations in anti-infective therapy of post-operative peritonitis and surgical site infections and highlights the importance of an AMS programme in abdominal surgery.<h4>Summary</h4>Larger studies evaluating the benefit of AMS in abdominal surgery are lacking. However, national and international guidelines have formulated appropriate recommendations for the rational use of antibiotics in post-operative peritonitis and surgical site infections. The rate of post-operative infections can be significantly reduced by perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The increase in multidrug-resistant bacteria complicates anti-infective therapy for post-operative infections. Analysis of local susceptibility patterns helps choose an adequate empiric therapy. A high rate of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria may necessitate the use of other reserve antibiotics in addition to carbapenems, which are approved for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections. A key role for the AMS team is the subsequent de-escalation of antibiotic therapy which limits the use of unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotics.<h4>Key messages</h4>The increase in multidrug-resistant bacteria poses challenges for abdominal surgery. Post-operative infections should be treated by an interdisciplinary team of surgeons and specialists for AMS.","<h4>Background</h4>Post-operative infection is a common complication following abdominal surgery.

This study intended to isolate indigenous EPFs from cadavers of <i>Protaetia brevitarsis</i> and investigate their effects on the fall armyworm <i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i> (FAW), a globally widespread invasive pest. Morphological and molecular analyses confirmed four native EPF strains all belong to <i>Beauveria bassiana</i>. Pathogenicity tests showed they were virulent toward FAW 1st instar larvae. The application of EPFs either by dipping or spraying significantly increased the larval mortalities compared to the control group, with corrected mortalities ranging from 92% to 73% after dipping in a fungal suspension of 10<sup>8</sup> conidia/mL, and those ranging from 76% to 35% after spraying with a fungal suspension of 10<sup>7</sup> conidia/mL.

To address this question, we compared the growth performance, physiological indicators and intestinal microbiological differences of deep-sea and coastal aquaculture in the Guangxi Beibu Gulf of China.

10.34133/bmr.0147,Synergistic Dual Ag/Cu Ion Implantation to Enhance Antimicrobial Defense on Boston Keratoprosthesis.,"The Boston keratoprosthesis (BKPro) is a critical device for vision restoration in complex cases of corneal blindness, although its long-term retention is challenged by infection risks. This study aims to enhance the antimicrobial properties of the titanium (Ti) backplate of the BKPro by ion implanting silver and copper ions to achieve effective infection control while maintaining cytocompatibility. Research on antimicrobial modifications for BKPro is limited, and while metallic ions like Ag and Cu show promise for biomaterial improvement, their effects on human corneal keratocytes (HCKs) require further study. Ag and Cu were implanted onto rough Ti surfaces, as mono- and coimplantations. Cytotoxicity was assessed in HCKs, and antimicrobial efficacy was tested against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Candida albicans</i>. After 21 d, monoimplanted Ag samples released 300.4 ppb of Ag<sup>+</sup>, coimplanted samples released 427.5 ppb of Ag<sup>+</sup> and 272.3 ppb of Cu ions, and monoimplanted Cu samples released 567.0 ppb of Cu ions. All ion-implanted surfaces supported HCK proliferation, exhibited no cytotoxicity, and showed strong antimicrobial activity. Ag-implanted surfaces provided antibacterial effects through membrane disruption and reactive oxygen species generation, while Cu-implanted surfaces exhibited antifungal effects via impaired enzymatic functions and reactive oxygen species. Coimplanted AgCu surfaces demonstrated synergistic antimicrobial effects, resulting from the synergy between the bactericidal actions of Ag and the oxidative stress contributions of Cu. Additionally, ion-implanted surfaces enhanced HCK adhesion under co-culture conditions. In conclusion, ion implantation effectively imparts antimicrobial properties to the Ti backplate of BKPro, reducing infection risks while preserving compatibility with corneal cells.","The Boston keratoprosthesis (BKPro) is a critical device for vision restoration in complex cases of corneal blindness, although its long-term retention is challenged by infection risks. This study aims to enhance the antimicrobial properties of the titanium (Ti) backplate of the BKPro by ion implanting silver and copper ions to achieve effective infection control while maintaining cytocompatibility. Research on antimicrobial modifications for BKPro is limited, and while metallic ions like Ag and Cu show promise for biomaterial improvement, their effects on human corneal keratocytes (HCKs) require further study. Ag and Cu were implanted onto rough Ti surfaces, as mono- and coimplantations. Cytotoxicity was assessed in HCKs, and antimicrobial efficacy was tested against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Candida albicans</i>. After 21 d, monoimplanted Ag samples released 300.4 ppb of Ag<sup>+</sup>, coimplanted samples released 427.5 ppb of Ag<sup>+</sup> and 272.3 ppb of Cu ions, and monoimplanted Cu samples released 567.0 ppb of Cu ions. All ion-implanted surfaces supported HCK proliferation, exhibited no cytotoxicity, and showed strong antimicrobial activity. Ag-implanted surfaces provided antibacterial effects through membrane disruption and reactive oxygen species generation, while Cu-implanted surfaces exhibited antifungal effects via impaired enzymatic functions and reactive oxygen species. Coimplanted AgCu surfaces demonstrated synergistic antimicrobial effects, resulting from the synergy between the bactericidal actions of Ag and the oxidative stress contributions of Cu.

10.3390/jcm14041093,Beyond the Graft: Recurrence of Interstitial Lung Diseases Post Transplant.,"Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) represent a heterogenous group of lung disorders marked by inflammation and/or fibrosis of the lung parenchyma, often leading to progressive shortness of breath and end-stage respiratory failure. In the U.S., ILDs affect approximately 650,000 individuals and cause approximately 25,000-30,000 deaths annually. Lung transplantation (LTx) offers definitive treatment for advanced ILD, with improved survival attributed to advancements in immunosuppression, organ preservation, surgical techniques, and postoperative care. However, disease recurrence in transplanted lungs remains a significant concern. Understanding the risk factors and mechanisms underlying recurrence is critical for refining recipient selection and improving outcomes. This review examines ILD recurrence post LTx and its implications for lung transplantation success.","Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) represent a heterogenous group of lung disorders marked by inflammation and/or fibrosis of the lung parenchyma, often leading to progressive shortness of breath and end-stage respiratory failure.

10.1155/mi/5525557,Strain-Dependent Differences in Inflammatory/Immune Activity in Cutaneous Wound Tissue Repair in Rats: The Significance of Body Mass/Proneness to Obesity.,"Inflammatory/immune cells and mediators are substantial for wound healing because they orchestrate biological activities in this complex process. Among factors that affect wound healing, obesity, and metabolic diseases are among the most significant, particularly because of a relationship between obesity and a prediabetic state with immune reactivity. Using Dark Agouti (DA) and Albino Oxford (AO) rats, which differ in immune responses as well as in proneness to obesity, we examined the impact of these intrinsic factors on cutaneous wound healing. Dynamics of the process were monitored at days 3, 5, and 7 post-wounding parallel in both rat strains by analysis of selected basic aspects of the wound repair process (cytokine and growth factor responses) in granulation tissue. Strain-related differences in the extent of reduction of the wound area were shown, which coincided with differential proinflammatory and immune-regulatory cytokines, as well as growth factors response in these rats. Some of these differences seem related to their dissimilarities in the proneness to obesity. Results in this study extended so far known differences in inflammatory/immune responses to a variety of stimuli between AO and DA rats and showed, for the first time, immune-based differences in wound healing between rats that differ in body mass (BM) and obesity proneness (under ad libitum feeding conditions with normal rodent chow).","Inflammatory/immune cells and mediators are substantial for wound healing because they orchestrate biological activities in this complex process.

10.3389/fimmu.2024.1467016,Systematic review of innate immune responses against &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; complex infection in animal models.,"<h4>Background</h4><i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)</i> complex (MTBC) includes ten species that affect mammals and pose a significant global health concern. Upon infection, <i>Mtb</i> induces various stages in the host, including early bacterial elimination, which may or may not involve memory responses. Deciphering the role of innate immune responses during MTBC infection is crucial for understanding disease progression or protection. Over the past decade, there has been growing interest in the innate immune response to <i>Mtb</i>, with new preclinical models emerging.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, focused on innate immune mediators linked to protection or disease progression in animal models of MTBC infection. We searched two databases: National Library of Medicine and Web of Science. Two researchers independently extracted data based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.<h4>Results</h4>Eighty-three articles were reviewed. Results were categorized in four groups: MTBC species, animal models, soluble factors and innate pathways, and other molecules (metabolites and drugs). <i>Mtb</i> and <i>M. bovis</i> were the only species studied. P2X7R receptor's role in disease progression and higher macrophage recruitment were observed differentially after infection with hypervirulent <i>Mtb</i> strains. Mice and non-human primates (NHPs) were the most used mammals, with emerging models like <i>Galleria mellonella</i> and planarians also studied. NHPs provided insights into age-dependent immunity and markers for active tuberculosis (ATB). Key innate immune factors/pathways identified included TNF-α, neutrophil recruitment, ROS/RNS responses, autophagy, inflammasomes, and antimicrobial peptides, with homologous proteins identified in insects. Metabolites like vitamin B5 and prostaglandin E2 were associated with protection. Immunomodulatory drugs targeting autophagy and other mechanisms were studied, exhibiting their potential as therapeutic alternatives.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Simpler, physiologically relevant, and ethically sound models, such as <i>G. mellonella</i>, are needed for studying innate responses in MTBC infection. While insects lack adaptive immunity, they could provide insights into ""pure"" innate immune responses. The dissection of ""pure,"" ""sustained"" (later than 7 days post-infection), and trained innate immunity presents additional challenges that require high-resolution temporospatial analytical methods. Identifying early innate immune mediators and targetable pathways in the blood and affected tissues could identify biomarkers for immunization efficiency, disease progression, and potential synergistic therapies for ATB.","<h4>Background</h4><i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)</i> complex (MTBC) includes ten species that affect mammals and pose a significant global health concern.

This study aims to evaluate the pathogens' coinfection prevalence among COVID-19 patients.<h4>Method</h4>In order to find all of the relevant articles, we used systematic search approach. Research-based databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus, without language restrictions, were searched to identify the relevant bacterial, fungal, and viral coinfections among COVID-19 cases from December 1, 2019, to August 23, 2021. In order to dig deeper, other scientific repositories such as Medrxiv were probed.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 13,023 studies were found through systematic search. After thorough analysis, only 64 studies with 61,547 patients were included in the study. The most common causative agents of coinfection among COVID-19 patients were bacteria (pooled prevalence: 20.97%; 95% CI: 15.95-26.46; I<sup>2</sup> : 99.9%) and less frequent were virus coinfections (pooled prevalence: 12.58%; 95% CI: 7.31-18.96; I<sup>2</sup> : 98.7%).

Its oral manifestations may occur in the mandible and tongue despite being rare. We aimed to systematically review the data on clinical manifestations, risk factors, diagnostic approaches, treatment options, and outcomes of mandibular and tongue mucormycosis.<h4>Methods</h4>An electronic search of articles published between January 1975 and November 2022 in PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases was performed. A total of 22 articles met the inclusion criteria and reported 27 cases of oral mucormycosis in total.<h4>Results</h4>Fourteen patients had mandibular mucormycosis signs unrelated to COVID-19 infection, 6 had SARS-CoV-2-related mandibular mucormycosis, and 6 had manifestations in the tongue. All published case reports during the COVID-19 pandemic were from India. Patient ages ranged from 4 months old to 82 years, and most patients had important comorbidities, such as blood dyscrasias related to immune deficiency and uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus. The signs and symptoms of mandibular and tongue mucormycosis varied from dental pain, loose teeth, and nonhealing sockets to dysphagia and paraesthesia of the lip. Some patients also reported trismus, draining sinus tract, and facial pain. The diagnosis of oral mucormycosis was based on a combination of clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic findings by demonstrating fungal hyphae in tissue specimens. In most cases, mucormycosis was managed with systemic amphotericin B, strict glycaemic control, and aggressive surgical debridement of infected tissue, minimising the progression of the fungal infection and thus improving the survival rate. In some cases, combined antifungal therapy, antibiotic therapy, and chlorhexidine mouthwashes were used successfully.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Recognition of the signs and symptoms by oral care providers is pertinent for the early diagnosis and treatment of tongue and mandibular mucormycosis, and providers should be aware of the possibility of this opportunistic fungal infection in patients with COVID-19. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended for the management of this lethal infection.","<h4>Aim</h4>Mucormycosis is a rare human infection associated with Mucorales, a group of filamentous moulds found in different environmental niches.

Pathogens were ranked based on their research and development needs and perceived public health importance using a series of global surveys and pathogen characteristics derived from systematic reviews. This systematic review evaluates the features and global impact of invasive disease caused by Candida glabrata (Nakaseomyces glabrata). PubMed and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting on mortality, morbidity (hospitalization and disability), drug resistance (including isolates from sterile and non-sterile sites, since these reflect the same organisms causing invasive infections), preventability, yearly incidence, diagnostics, treatability, and distribution/emergence in the last 10 years. Candida glabrata (N. glabrata) causes difficult-to-treat invasive infections, particularly in patients with underlying conditions such as immunodeficiency, diabetes, or those who have received broad-spectrum antibiotics or chemotherapy. Beyond standard infection prevention and control measures, no specific preventative measures have been described. We found that infection is associated with high mortality rates and that there is a lack of data on complications and sequelae. Resistance to azoles is common and well described in echinocandins-in both cases, the resistance rates are increasing. Candida glabrata remains mostly susceptible to amphotericin and flucytosine. However, the incidence of the disease is increasing, both at the population level and as a proportion of all invasive yeast infections, and the increases appear related to the use of antifungal agents.","Recognising the growing global burden of fungal infections, the World Health Organization (WHO) established an advisory group consisting of experts in fungal diseases to develop a Fungal Priority Pathogen List.

Effective biocontrol strategies, particularly the development of mycoinsecticides, require the identification of virulent entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) and the establishment of reliable bioassay systems. However, establishing reliable bioassay systems for SFB has been particularly challenging, especially for larval stages due to their recalcitrant rearing requirements. This study aimed to establish a standardized bioassay protocol to evaluate EPF efficacy against SFB. A specialized larval collection apparatus was developed, and the virulence of three EPF strains (<i>Beauveria bassiana</i> BbPs01, <i>Metarhizium robertii</i> MrCb01, and <i>Cordyceps javanica</i> IjH6102) was assessed against both adult and larval stages using a radish slice-based rearing system. Intriguingly, BbPs01 and MrCb01 exhibited significantly higher LT<sub>50</sub> values in larvae than in adults, contrary to the typical pattern of greater larval susceptibility observed in most insect systems. We hypothesized that isothiocyanate-specifically sulforaphane, a compound abundant in radish tissues-exerts fungistatic effects that impair fungal growth and virulence. Follow-up experiments confirmed that radish-derived sulforaphane inhibited fungal activity. Through alternative host plant screening, Chinese flowering cabbage (<i>Brassica campestris</i> L. ssp. <i>chinensis</i> var. <i>utilis</i>) was identified as an optimal larval diet that minimally interferes with EPF bioactivity, enabling reliable virulence assessments. This study presents critical methodological advancements for SFB biocontrol research, providing a robust framework for standardized larval bioassay and novel insights into plant secondary metabolite interactions with entomopathogens.

This scoping review comprehensively maps the reported predictors and critically evaluates the performance, methodology, and reporting of predictive models for these conditions. A total of 174 studies were identified from database searches, with 73 reporting OM predictors, 97 reporting dysphagia predictors, and 4 reporting both OM and dysphagia predictors. These predictors included patient demographics, tumor classification, chemoradiotherapy regimen, radiation dose to organs-at-risk, genetic factors, and results of clinical laboratory tests. Notably, many studies only conducted univariate analysis or focused exclusively on certain predictor types. Among the included studies, numerous predictive models were reported: eight for acute OM, five for acute dysphagia, and nine for late dysphagia. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) ranged between 0.65 and 0.81, 0.60 and 0.82, and 0.70 and 0.85 for acute oral mucositis, acute dysphagia, and late dysphagia predictive models, respectively. Several areas for improvement were identified, including the need for external validation with sufficiently large sample sizes, further standardization of predictor and outcome definitions, and more comprehensive reporting to facilitate reproducibility.","Despite advances in head and neck cancer treatment, virtually all patients experience chemoradiation-induced toxicities.

10.3390/cells13242040,KSRP Deficiency Attenuates the Course of Pulmonary Aspergillosis and Is Associated with the Elevated Pathogen-Killing Activity of Innate Myeloid Immune Cells.,"The mRNA-binding protein KSRP (KH-type splicing regulatory protein) is known to modulate immune cell functions post-transcriptionally, e.g., by reducing the mRNA stability of cytokines. It is known that KSRP binds the AU-rich motifs (ARE) that are often located in the 3'-untranslated part of mRNA species, encoding dynamically regulated proteins as, for example, cytokines. Innate myeloid immune cells, such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and macrophages (MACs), eliminate pathogens by multiple mechanisms, including phagocytosis and the secretion of chemo- and cytokines. Here, we investigated the role of KSRP in the phenotype and functions of both innate immune cell types in the mouse model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Here, KSRP<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed lower levels of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> conidia (AFC) and an increase in the frequencies of PMNs and MACs in the lungs. Our results showed that PMNs and MACs from KSRP<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited an enhanced phagocytic uptake of AFC, accompanied by increased ROS production in PMNs upon stimulation. A comparison of RNA sequencing data revealed that 64 genes related to inflammatory and immune responses were shared between PMNs and MACs. The majority of genes upregulated in PMNs were involved in metabolic processes, cell cycles, and DNA repair. Similarly, KSRP-deficient PMNs displayed reduced levels of apoptosis. In conclusion, our results indicate that KSRP serves as a critical negative regulator of PMN and MAC anti-pathogen activity.","The mRNA-binding protein KSRP (KH-type splicing regulatory protein) is known to modulate immune cell functions post-transcriptionally, e.g., by reducing the mRNA stability of cytokines.

10.3389/fimmu.2024.1452393,The vacuolar anti-<i>Pseudomonal</i> activity of neutrophil primary granule peptidyl-arginine deiminase enzymes.,"The role of neutrophils in host defense involves several cell processes including phagocytosis, degranulation of antimicrobial proteins, and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). In turn, dysregulated cell activity is associated with the pathogenesis of airway and rheumatic diseases, in which neutrophil-derived enzymes including peptidyl-arginine deiminases (PADs) play a role. Known physiological functions of PADs in neutrophils are limited to the activity of PAD isotype 4 in histone citrullination in NET formation. The aim of this study was to extend our knowledge on the role of PADs in neutrophils and, specifically, bacterial killing within the confines of the phagocytic vacuole. Human neutrophils were fractionated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifuge and PADs localized in subcellular compartments by Western blot analysis. Direct interaction of PADs with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>P. aeruginosa</i>) was assessed by flow cytometry and Western blot overlay. The participation of neutrophil PAD2 and PAD4 in killing of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> was assessed by inclusion of PAD-specific inhibitors. <i>In vitro</i>, bactericidal activity of recombinant human PAD2 or PAD4 enzymes against <i>P. aeruginosa</i> was determined by enumeration of colony-forming units (CFU). Together with neutrophil elastase (NE), PAD2 and PAD4 were localized to primary granules and, following activation with particulate stimuli, were degranulated in to the phagocytic vacuole. <i>In vitro</i>, PAD2 and PAD4 bound <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (p = 0.04) and significantly reduced bacterial survival to 49.1 ± 17.0 (p < 0.0001) and 48.5 ± 13.9% (p < 0.0001), respectively. Higher antibacterial activity was observed at neutral pH levels with the maximum toxicity at pH 6.5 and pH 7.5, comparable to the effects of neutrophil bactericidal permeability increasing protein. In phagosomal killing assays, inclusion of the PAD2 inhibitor, AFM-30a, or PAD4 inhibitor, GSK484, significantly increased survival of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (AFM-30a, p = 0.05; and GSK484, p = 0.0079). Results indicate that PAD2 and PAD4 possess antimicrobial activity and are directly involved in the neutrophil antimicrobial processes.

As there is a drastic increase in the aging population, so did the use of removable dentures more than ever before. The use of dentures among the elderly provides functional advantages and esthetic benefits. However, improper use and poor oral hygiene with removable dentures come with complications, including denture stomatitis, ulcerations, pneumonia, and many more. The study aims to determine the complications associated with inappropriate use and poor oral care and bring forth evidence-based dentist-recommended guidelines for denture maintenance. Articles were systematically screened in PubMed/Medline (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), PubMed Central (PMC), and Cochrane Library using keywords. Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) was also utilized to identify relevant articles. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, duplicate articles were discarded, and then the articles were reviewed by title and abstract screening. The remaining articles went through a detailed full-text review. A quality appraisal check was conducted for each unique type of research publication, after which a total of 22 articles were finalized. In this study, we have seen pathological biofilm formation on dentures, life-threatening pneumonia, denture stomatitis, and accidental ingestion/aspiration of dentures amongst the elderly population. The study also identified members with low literacy rates, minorities, and low-income families seem to be at higher risk of poor oral care and denture hygiene. We identified that most of these complications could be prevented with proper guidance and education. In the future, a further detailed study is important as no clear consensus exists in terms of best practices of denture cleaning methods. In addition, measures should be initiated to encourage regular dentist appointments and increase accessibility among members of low socioeconomic status and minorities.","The importance of oral care and its relationship with an individual's well-being has been identified over the past few decades.

Mortality rate could reach 100% if infections remain untreated in cryptococcal meningitis. Treatment options for cryptococcosis are limited and and there are no licensed vaccines clinically available to treat or prevent cryptococcosis. Our study utilizes an integrated bioinformatics approaches to develop a polyvalent multiepitope subunit vaccine focusing on the key virulent proteins Heat shock transcription factor and Chaperone DnaK of both C. neoformans and C. gatti. Then in silico analysis was done to predict highly antigenic epitopes by assessing antigenicity, transmembrane topology screening, allergenecity, toxicity, and molecular docking approaches. Following this analysis, we designed two vaccine constructs integrating a compatible adjuvant and suitable linkers. These constructs exhibited notable characteristics including high antigenicity, non-toxicity, solubility, stability, and compatibility with Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The interaction between both vaccine constructs and TLR2, TLR3, and TLR9 was assessed through molecular docking analysis. Molecular dynamics simulations and MM-PBSA calculations suggest the substantial stabilizing property and binding affinity of Vaccine Construct V1 against TLR9. Both the vaccines revealed to have a higher number of interchain hydrogen bond with TLR9. These findings serve as a crucial stepping stone towards a comprehensive solution for combating cryptococcus infections induced by both C. neoformans and C. gattii. Further validation through in vivo studies is crucial to confirm the effectiveness and potential of the vaccine to curb the spread of cryptococcosis. Subsequent validation through in vivo studies is paramount to confirm the effectiveness and potential of the vaccine in reducing the spread of cryptococcosis.","Cryptococcosis is a lethal mycosis instigated by the pathogenic species Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, primarily affects the lungs, manifesting as pneumonia, and the brain, where it presents as meningitis.

This was an observational retrospective study on eight patients from three tertiary centers in Romania. The tissue samples collected during functional endoscopic sinus surgery were studied through histopathological examination, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. In the histopathological examination, the morphological aspects characteristic of mucormycosis in all cases were identified: wide aseptate hyphae with right-angle ramifications, which invade blood vessels. One case presented perineural invasion into the perineural lymphatics. And in another case, mucormycosis-aspergillosis fungal coinfection was identified. Through scanning electron microscopy, long hyphae on the surface of the mucosa surrounded by cells belonging to the local immune system were identified in all samples, and bacterial biofilms were identified in half of the samples. Through transmission electron microscopy, aseptate hyphae and bacterial elements were identified in the majority of the samples. Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis associated with COVID-19 produces nasal sinus dysbiosis, which favors the appearance of bacterial biofilms.

PubMed and Web of Science were used to identify studies reporting on annual incidence, mortality, morbidity, antifungal resistance, preventability, and distribution/emergence in the past 10 years. Mortality rates due to C. neoformans were 41%-61%. Complications included acute renal impairment, raised intracranial pressure needing shunts, and blindness. There was moderate evidence of reduced susceptibility (MIC range 16-32 mg/l) of C. neoformans to fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin B. Cryptococcus gattii infections comprised 11%-33% of all cases of invasive cryptococcosis globally. The mortality rates were 10%-23% for central nervous system (CNS) and pulmonary infections, and ∼43% for bloodstream infections. Complications described included neurological sequelae (17%-27% in C. gattii infections) and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. MICs were generally low for amphotericin B (MICs: 0.25-0.5 mg/l), 5-flucytosine (MIC range: 0.5-2 mg/l), itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole (MIC range: 0.06-0.5 mg/l). There is a need for increased surveillance of disease phenotype and outcome, long-term disability, and drug susceptibility to inform robust estimates of disease burden.","Cryptococcosis causes a high burden of disease worldwide.

The questionnaire consisted of 30 online polling items and aimed to evaluate respondents' knowledge pertaining to fungal infections, encompassing aspects such as prevention strategies, disease trajectory, and therapeutic modalities. The survey sample specifically encompassed students and sports enthusiasts associated with 33 Internet groups, and data collection transpired during the period spanning 12 January to 15 March, 2018, predating the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic.<h4>Results</h4>In the study, 85.2% of participants regularly inspected their feet, with 4.8% seeking podiatric services. While 75.2% demonstrated hygienic behaviour by changing towels after each pool visit, 41.4% acknowledged sharing nail tools. Notably, 75.7% preferred professional assistance for symptoms, with 24.3% opting for home remedies. Gender disparities were evident, with women showing significantly better hygiene practices and pool usage than men (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Women also exhibited a stronger tendency to disinfect grooming tools and prioritise sterility during beautician services (<i>p</i> < 0.001). These findings emphasise the importance of gender-specific health behaviour analysis in promoting preventive measures.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The study highlights onychomycosis as a significant societal concern. Pre-COVID-19, awareness among municipal swimming pool users regarding prevention, symptoms, and treatment of athlete's foot and onychomycosis was insufficient.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Superficial mycosis is one of the most common diseases worldwide; however, its epidemiology is changing over time.<h4>Aim</h4>To present the awareness of people using swimming pools about athlete's foot and onychomycosis.<h4>Material and methods</h4>A total of 690 participants were subjected to an extensive survey administered via Google Documents.

10.2196/43969,Nondrug Intervention for Opportunistic Infections in Individuals With Hematological Malignancy: Systematic Review.,"<h4>Background</h4>Hematological malignancies disturb the blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. Taking medications for treating opportunistic infections (OIs) in these individuals may enhance the risk of medication interaction as well as adverse drug reactions.<h4>Objective</h4>This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of nondrug interventions in reducing OIs among patients with hematological cancers.<h4>Methods</h4>The PubMed, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and Embase databases were searched on December 26, 2022, for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The primary endpoint was OIs. The quality of included studies was assessed by the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 6 studies were included in this review with 4 interventions: (1) types of mouthwash received, (2) presence of coating on central venous catheters (CVCs), (3) use of well-fitted masks, and (4) types of diet consumed. The results were presented in 8 different comparisons: (1) chlorhexidine-nystatin versus saline mouth rinse, (2) chlorhexidine versus saline mouth rinse, (3) nystatin versus saline mouth rinse, (4) chlorhexidine silver sulfadiazine-coated CVCs versus uncoated catheters, (5) well-fitted masks versus no mask, (6) amine fluoride-stannous fluoride versus sodium fluoride mouthwash, (7) low-bacterial diet versus standard hospital diet, and (8) herbal versus placebo mouthwash. No clear differences were reported in any of the outcomes examined in the first 3 comparisons. There were also no clear differences in the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infection or insertion site infection between the use of chlorhexidine silver sulfadiazine-coated CVCs versus uncoated catheters in the patients. Further, no significant differences were seen between patients who used a well-fitted mask and those without a mask in the incidence of OI. The all-cause mortality and mortality due to OI were similar between the 2 groups. There was no clear difference in all-cause mortality, although common adverse effects were reported in patients who used sodium fluoride mouthwash compared with those using amine fluoride-stannous fluoride mouthwash. There was no evidence of any difference in the incidence of possible invasive aspergillosis or candidemia between patients who consumed a low-bacterial diet and a standard diet. For the last comparison, no significant difference was seen between patients who received herbal and placebo mouthwash.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Very limited evidence was available to measure the effectiveness of nondrug interventions in hematological cancers. The effectiveness of the interventions included in this review needs to be evaluated further in high-quality RCTs in a dedicated setting among patients with hematological malignancies.<h4>Trial registration</h4>PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews CRD42020169186; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=169186.","<h4>Background</h4>Hematological malignancies disturb the blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow.

All synthesized compounds were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques, including <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, and mass spectrometry. The biological activity of these compounds was evaluated against five bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii) and three fungal strains (Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida albicans). The results revealed that compound (4c) exhibited potent antifungal activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 6.25 µg/mL across all tested strains and zone of inhibition (ZOI) against Candida albicans is 27 mm. Furthermore, time kill kinetics of Candida albicans and haemolysis assays also perform in support of their antifungal activity. Additionally, all synthesized compounds were subjected to computational analysis using molecular descriptors, ADMET, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics to find protein-ligand interactions. Molecular docking studies indicated that the most effective antifungal compounds (3h and 4c) exhibited binding energies of -8.76 and -8.44 kcal/mol for DHFR and -7.96 and -8.24 kcal/mol for NMT1, respectively. The obtained results revealed that these compounds exhibit potential interactions with antifungal targets as dual inhibitors. As a result, this study finds an important approach to synthesized compounds with potential antifungal activity.","In this study, a series of novel α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds (3a-j) and their pyrazoline derivatives (4a-e and 5a-b) were designed and successfully synthesized.

10.1111/pde.15100,Systematic review of the prevalence of onychomycosis in children.,"Onychomycosis is one of the most common nail diseases in adults but is described as infrequent in children. Data are, however, scattered and diverse. Studies have nevertheless suggested that the prevalence of onychomycosis is increasing in children lately and the aim of this review was therefore to examine this problem. Two authors individually searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for articles on epidemiology and prevalence of onychomycosis in children. The literature search was conducted in accordance per PRISMA guidelines. In total 1042 articles were identified of which 23 were eligible for inclusion. One of the articles presented two studies and a total of 24 studies were therefore included. Seventeen studies presented data of the prevalence of onychomycosis in children in the general population and seven studies among children visiting a dermatological and pediatric department or clinic. The prevalence ranged from 0% to 7.66% with an overall discrete increase of 0.66% during the period 1972 to 2014 in population studies (not statistically significant). This review supports a trend towards an increased prevalence of onychomycosis in children, albeit based on a paucity of studies. The data suggests an increasing prevalence of onychomycosis with age, and co-infection with tinea pedis (reported in 25% of the studies). The most common pathogen reported was Trichophyton rubrum and onychomycosis was more prevalent in toenails compared to fingernails. The general characteristics of onychomycosis in children are thus similar to those described in adults.","Onychomycosis is one of the most common nail diseases in adults but is described as infrequent in children.

With time, many issues related to co-infections in COVID-19 patients are constantly surfacing. There have been numerous reports about various fungal co-infections in patients with COVID-19. The extent of severity of fungal pathogens has been recognized as a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. Awareness, understanding, and a systematic approach to managing fungal co-infections in COVID-19 patients are important. No guidelines have enumerated the stepwise approach to managing the fungal infections co-occurring with COVID-19. This review is intended to present an overview of the fungal co-infections in COVID-19 patients and their stepwise screening and management.<h4>Recent findings</h4>The most common fungal infections that have been reported to co-exist with COVID-19 are Candidemia, Aspergillosis, and Mucormycosis. Prevalence of co-infections in COVID-19 patients has been reported to be much higher in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially those in intensive care units. While clear pathogenetic mechanisms have not been delineated, COVID-19 patients are at a high risk of invasive fungal infections.<h4>Summary</h4>As secondary fungal infections have been challenging to treat in COVID-19 patients, as they tend to affect the critically ill or immunocompromised patients, a delay in diagnosis and treatment may be fatal. Antifungal drugs should be initiated with caution after carefully assessing the immune status of the patients, drug interactions, and adverse effects. The crucial factors in successfully treating fungal infections in COVID-19 patients are optimal diagnostic approach, routine screening, and timely initiation of antifungal therapy.","<h4>Purpose of review</h4>Severe-acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been driving the health care delivery system for over 2 years.

How to manage this disease has been a challenge and therefore understanding the regulation of host molecular components in response to pathogen infection is necessary. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive proteomic analysis of mango leaves upon inoculation with the leaf spot pathogen A. alternata.<h4>Results</h4>Determination of enzyme activity revealed a significant accumulation of cell-wall degrading enzymes cellulase and β-Glucosidase in pathogen inoculated mango leaves. A total of 472 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were detected in the proteome data with significant up-regulation of GO terms associated with response to fungus infection. The significantly downregulated proteins during pathogen invasion and colonization were involved in the photosynthesis, phenylpropanoid, flavonoid biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism pathway. The significantly upregulated proteins belonged to tyrosine metabolism and MAPK signalling pathway, signifying their crucial role in host resistance to leaf spot pathogen.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our finding provide useful data on differential expression of proteins for designing novel management strategies to specifically target mango host defense components to achieve the best control of leaf spot disease in mango.","<h4>Background</h4>Mango is an economically important fruit tree in many regions of the world, but is highly susceptible to mango leaf spot disease, caused by Alternaria species.

Here, we develop peptide nanozymes which mimic the mode of action of AMPs and AMEs through de novo design and peptide assembly. Through modelling a minimal building block of IHIHICI is proposed by combining critical amino acids in AMPs and AMEs and hydrophobic isoleucine to conduct assembly. Experimental validations reveal that IHIHICI assemble into helical β-sheet nanotubes with acetate modulation and perform phospholipase C-like and peroxidase-like activities with Ni coordination, demonstrating high thermostability and resistance to enzymatic degradation. The assembled nanotubes demonstrate cascade antifungal actions including outer mannan docking, wall disruption, lipid peroxidation and subsequent ferroptotic death, synergistically killing >90% Candida albicans within 10 min on disinfection pad. These findings demonstrate an effective de novo design strategy for developing materials with multi-antimicrobial mode of actions.","Natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and enzymes (AMEs) are promising non-antibiotic candidates against antimicrobial resistance but suffer from low efficiency and poor stability.

We characterised the endophytic fungal communities and terpene concentrations of 30 white spruce families across two sites. We determined the effects of fungal endophytes on a defoliating insect, eastern spruce budworm, by testing the budworm responses to media amended with fungal endophytes or exposing them to their volatile organic compounds. We further examined whether the changes in the endophytic fungal communities and abundance alter the terpene concentrations of white spruce by inoculating seedlings with endophytic fungi. Terpene and fungal community compositions in mature trees varied among families and sites. The bioassays showed fungal endophytes can kill budworms or reduce their fitness due to the toxicity of fungal mycelium or volatile compounds. The inoculation experiments demonstrated that the changes in fungal communities and abundance can alter the terpene concentrations in seedlings. We developed a ""Plant Partnership Hypothesis"" to reflect the role of fungal endophytes in plant resistance to insect herbivores, demonstrating a co-evolutionary relationship among fungal endophytes, tree defences, and insect herbivores.","Fungal endophytes can alter plant resistance against herbivores by indirectly influencing plant secondary metabolism or through direct effects of their own metabolism.

With this in mind, this study aimed to verify the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the use of the biosimilar etanercept in relation to the reference biologic in patients over 18 years of age with rheumatoid arthritis.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the parameters of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) selecting only Phase III randomized clinical trials. The search strategy was constructed with the MeSH terms ""Etanercept"", ""Biological Products"", ""Arthritis, Rheumatoid"", ""Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals"" and was performed in Medline via PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EBSCO and Lilacs in January 2023. The analysis measures were relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. The statistical analysis for preparing meta-analyses was developed by the Review Manager 5.1.4 software.<h4>Results</h4>This systematic review selected 6 eligible studies with a sample population of n = 2355. The main efficacy outcomes showed that both drugs did not present statistically significant differences in ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses within 6 months (RR 1.00; 95% CI = 0.94 to 1.07; RR 1.09; 95% CI = 0.94 to 1.26; RR 1.04; 95% CI = 0.82 to 1.31, respectively), with I<sup>2</sup> ranging from 55 to 63% and 0.04 ≤ P ≥ 0.08. Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate, and serious adverse events were not statistically significant. Regarding immunogenicity, only 5.4% of the ADA-positive biosimilar group had positive neutralizing antibodies.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Thus, this review found that biosimilar etanercept had efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity similar to those for the biological reference.<h4>Systematic review registration</h4>This systematic review was registered on the PROSPERO platform under number CRD42020166610.","<h4>Background</h4>Biosimilar etanercept presents itself as an innovative therapeutic opportunity for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, however, its efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in relation to the reference biological agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is still questioned.

In this study we focused on the isolation and characterisation of extracellular vesicles, specifically exosomes and exosome-like vesicles, from Arion secretions. We developed a method for slug mucus collection and subsequent vesicle isolation by ultracentrifugation. The isolated vesicles with an average diameter of ~ 100 nm carry abundant proteins and short RNAs, as well as adhesion molecules similar to mammalian galectins. We demonstrated that the slug extracellular vesicles are internalised by plant cells and human cancer cells in in vitro assays and are loadable by bioactive compounds, which makes them an interesting tool for utilisation in biotechnology.","The slug Arion vulgaris has attracted major attention as one of the worst invasive herbivore pests in Europe and is renowned for the stiff mucus it secretes for locomotion.

However, the contents of protein and free amino acids did not change significantly, suggesting that the nutritional value was not altered. Pathogens were found not to be involved in the formation of BHBT symptoms, as fungi and pathogenic bacteria were not enriched in damaged pods. Two herbivory-induced flavonoids-7,4'-dihydroxyflavone and coumestrol-were found to exert insecticidal activity. Our study clarified that BHBT symptoms are directly caused by the thrip.

Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is the most significant risk factor for CPA. However, the true burden of CPA at the time of PTB diagnosis, during, and after PTB treatment remains unknown. In this paper, we present a protocol for a living systematic review aimed at estimating the current burden of CPA along the continuum of PTB care.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines to formulate this protocol, which is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42023453900). We will identify primary literature through various electronic databases, including CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE, MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, Google Scholar, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and African Journal Online. The search will encompass articles from inception to December 31st, 2023, using medical subject heading search terms ""pulmonary tuberculosis"" AND ""chronic pulmonary aspergillosis"". Two reviewers will independently assess titles, abstracts, and full texts for eligibility using the Covidence web-based software. The eligible studies will comprise original observational research that reports on the prevalence of CPA diagnosed in individuals with PTB, based on established criteria, without language or geographic restriction. We intend to exclude single case reports and case series with fewer than 10 participants, as well as review articles, guidelines, and letters to the editors. Cochrane Risk of Bias Tools (ROB2 and ROBINS-I) will used to assess study quality and risk of bias and the quality of the evidence will be rated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) tool. Our data syntheses will encompass meta-analysis and meta-regression, conducted using STATA version 18 and R- Studio version 4.0.2. This systematic review will be updated every 3-5 years as more data emerges.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The findings of this proposed systematic review will summarize the available evidence on the occurrence of CPA, at the time of PTB diagnosis, during and after PTB treatment. The study results have the potential to guide healthcare policies regarding screening for CPA, enhance clinical decision-making, and catalyse further research into understanding the interplay between PTB and CPA.

Although several genera of fungi are capable of causing infections in the central nervous system (CNS), the most significant number of registered cases have, as causal agents, yeasts of the genus Cryptococcus. The relevance of cryptococcal meningitis has changed in the last decades, mainly due to the increase in the number of people living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and medications that impair the immune responses.

10.3390/biology11101409,Behavioral Avoidance Response of <i>Daphnia</i> to Fungal Infection Caused by <i>Metschnikowia</i> Species in a Temperate Reservoir.,"Morphological or behavioral defense mechanisms are important evolutionary strategies for the survival of prey. Studies have focused on predation and competition, but infection has been overlooked, despite being a determining factor of distribution and species diversity of prey. We hypothesized that the winter migration of <i>Daphnia pulicaria</i> is a community defense strategy to avoid fungal infection. To test this hypothesis, environmental variables and the Cladocera community, including <i>D. pulicaria</i>, were monitored in three study sections of the Anri Reservoir in the Republic of Korea during September 2010-August 2015. During three winter seasons, the density of infected <i>D. pulicaria</i> increased in all study sections, and they migrated from the central to the littoral area. Most of the infected individuals had dormant eggs in sexually reproducing mothers. However, when the proportion of non-infected individuals was higher than that of infected individuals, winter migration was not observed. Additional microcosm experiments showed that dormant eggs of <i>D. pulicaria</i> obtained from ice crystals in the littoral area had lower hatching and infection rates than those obtained from mothers moving from other zones. Therefore, the migration of <i>D. pulicaria</i> during winter is an active response to avoid intergenerational fungal infection.","Morphological or behavioral defense mechanisms are important evolutionary strategies for the survival of prey. Studies have focused on predation and competition, but infection has been overlooked, despite being a determining factor of distribution and species diversity of prey. We hypothesized that the winter migration of <i>Daphnia pulicaria</i> is a community defense strategy to avoid fungal infection. To test this hypothesis, environmental variables and the Cladocera community, including <i>D. pulicaria</i>, were monitored in three study sections of the Anri Reservoir in the Republic of Korea during September 2010-August 2015. During three winter seasons, the density of infected <i>D. pulicaria</i> increased in all study sections, and they migrated from the central to the littoral area. Most of the infected individuals had dormant eggs in sexually reproducing mothers. However, when the proportion of non-infected individuals was higher than that of infected individuals, winter migration was not observed.

10.3390/bioengineering11111115,Nanoparticle-Mediated Delivery of Deferasirox: A Promising Strategy Against Invasive Aspergillosis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a deadly fungal lung infection. Antifungal resistance and treatment side effects are major concerns. Iron chelators are vital for IA management, but systemic use can cause side effects. We developed nanoparticles (NPs) to selectively deliver the iron chelator deferasirox (DFX) for IA treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>DFX was encapsulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs using a single emulsion solvent evaporation method. The NPs were characterized by light scattering and electron microscopy. DFX loading efficiency and release were assessed spectrophotometrically. Toxicity was evaluated using SRB, luciferase, and XTT assays. Therapeutic efficacy was tested in an IA mouse model, assessing fungal burden by qPCR and biodistribution via imaging.<h4>Results</h4>DFX-NPs had a size of ~50 nm and a charge of ~-30 mV, with a loading efficiency of ~80%. Release kinetics showed DFX release via diffusion and bioerosion. The EC50 of DFX-NPs was significantly lower (<i>p</i> < 0.001) than the free drug, and they were significantly less toxic (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) in mammalian cell cultures. In vivo, NP treatment significantly reduced <i>Af</i> burden (<i>p</i> < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The designed DFX-NPs effectively target and kill <i>Af</i> with minimal toxicity to mammalian cells. The significant in vivo therapeutic efficacy suggests these NPs could be a safe and effective treatment for IA.","<h4>Background</h4>Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a deadly fungal lung infection.

,Prosthetic rehabilitation of untailored defects using patient-specific implants.,"The restoration of speech, deglutition, mastication, and respiration in patients with bimaxillary resection involving the maxillae, hard and soft palates, and paranasal sinuses poses a significant challenge. This clinical report describes the prosthodontic management of a patient with bilateral maxillectomy caused due to post-COVID-19 mucormycosis. A patient-specific implants (PSI) that matched the remnants of the zygoma complex was designed to improve the patient's severely impaired speech and swallowing. The patient's postsurgical anatomy was first visualized using three-dimensional computed tomography data. Following that, a customized zygoma-supported titanium framework was designed to support the prosthesis based on the data. Two weeks after the framework was installed, an open-tray impression was made and the prosthesis was fabricated. These findings suggest that PSI-retained prosthesis can be considered in cases with severely compromised maxillary bone anatomy, impaired oral functioning, and no viable conventional reconstruction options.","The restoration of speech, deglutition, mastication, and respiration in patients with bimaxillary resection involving the maxillae, hard and soft palates, and paranasal sinuses poses a significant challenge.

10.1186/s12870-025-06476-z,Transcriptomic analysis reveals molecular phenological changes during the flower-to-fruit transition in Vanilla planifolia Andrews (Orchidaceae).,"<h4>Background</h4>The transition from flower to fruit, encompassing flower formation to fruit maturation, has been extensively studied in model plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the Orchidaceae family, including Vanilla planifolia, exhibits a unique phenomenon known as post-pollination syndrome (PPS), where pollination initiates ovule development but often leads to premature ovary drop. This phenomenon significantly impacts the yield and stability of V. planifolia crops. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying PPS is essential for improving crop production. This study explores transcriptomic and histological variations to identify key molecular and phenological changes in the ovary during the flower-to-fruit transition in V. planifolia.<h4>Results</h4>The flower-to-fruit transition in Vanilla planifolia involves dynamic changes in gene expression and phenotypic events, which can be categorized into four distinct stages: (1) Pre-pollination: Ovary differentiation is characterized by the enrichment of nitrogen metabolism and photoperiod-responsive pathways. The upregulation of VpVRN5-like and VpNAC14-like suggests their roles in photoperiod-induced flowering and ovarian tissue differentiation in response to nitrate availability. (2) Pollination: Key events include nucellar filament branching and the functional enrichment of pathways associated with growth and responses to light intensity. The upregulation of VpMBS1-like indicates its involvement in regulating and adapting to high light conditions. (3) Post-pollination: This stage is marked by embryo sac formation and pollen tube elongation, with enrichment in auxin response pathways. The upregulation of VpIAA6-like and VpRALF27-like suggests their roles in auxin signaling during ovule development. (4) Fertilization: Seed development is associated with the enrichment of abiotic stress response pathways and carbohydrate transport. The upregulation of VpAAE3-like, VpPR1-like, and VpSWET12-like suggests functions in stress responses and sucrose transport, potentially linked to fungal interactions or symbiosis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study characterizes the molecular and phenological changes occurring during the flower-to-fruit transition in V. planifolia by integrating transcriptomic analysis with anatomical data on post-pollination syndrome. Based on functional predictions, this approach provides valuable insights into the mechanisms governing this transition in plants exhibiting PPS and identifies candidate genes for future experimental validation in V. planifolia.<h4>Clinical trial number</h4>Not applicable.","<h4>Background</h4>The transition from flower to fruit, encompassing flower formation to fruit maturation, has been extensively studied in model plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana.

10.1093/burnst/tkad061,Consensus on the treatment of second-degree burn wounds (2024 edition).,"Second-degree burns are the most common type of burn in clinical practice and hard to manage. Their treatment requires not only a consideration of the different outcomes that may arise from the dressing changes or surgical therapies themselves but also an evaluation of factors such as the burn site, patient age and burn area. Meanwhile, special attention should be given to the fact that there is no unified standard or specification for the diagnosis, classification, surgical procedure, and infection diagnosis and grading of second-degree burn wounds. This not only poses great challenges to the formulation of clinical treatment plans but also significantly affects the consistency of clinical studies. Moreover, currently, there are relatively few guidelines or expert consensus for the management of second-degree burn wounds, and no comprehensive and systematic guidelines or specifications for the treatment of second-degree burns have been formed. Therefore, we developed the Consensus on the Treatment of Second-Degree Burn Wounds (2024 edition), based on evidence-based medicine and expert opinion. This consensus provides specific recommendations on prehospital first aid, nonsurgical treatment, surgical treatment and infection treatment for second-degree burns. The current consensus generated a total of 58 recommendations, aiming to form a standardized clinical treatment plan.","Second-degree burns are the most common type of burn in clinical practice and hard to manage.

10.3390/ijms26010255,Cellular Response of Immune Cells in the Upper Respiratory Tract After Treatment with Cold Atmospheric Plasma In Vitro.,"Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has antimicrobial properties and is also known to stimulate the immune system. These properties could be useful for the development of a novel therapeutic or preventive strategy against respiratory infections in the upper respiratory tract (URT) such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) without inducing an immune overreaction. This study investigated the cellular responses of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) after exposure to CAP in a three-dimensional (3D) model of the URT. In vitro experiments were conducted using PMNs isolated from human blood to assess cell migration, intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), NETosis, surface marker expression (CD11b, CD62L, and CD66b), and cell death with live cell imaging and flow cytometry. CAP was applied for 5 min using two distinct modalities: pressurized air plasma with a plasma intensive care (PIC) device and nebulized air plasma (NP) with a new humidity resistent surface microdischarge (SMD) plasma source, both developed by Terraplasma Medical GmbH. There were no significant signs of cell damage or overstimulation with either device under the conditions tested. However, the NP device caused milder effects on PMN functionality compared to the PIC device, but also demonstrated reduced antibacterial efficacy and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) production, as analyzed with colorimetric/fluorimetric assay kits. These findings highlight a trade-off between the two CAP modalities, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Further studies are necessary to investigate these effects in the clinical setting and evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of CAP treatment in the URT.","Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has antimicrobial properties and is also known to stimulate the immune system.

However, it is affected by toxin-producing fungi, mainly <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>, <i>Fusarium verticillioides</i>, and <i>Aspergillus flavus</i>, which compromise its quality. This study, conducted in 2022 and 2023 at the Látókép long-term research site of the University of Debrecen, Hungary, investigated the effects of different nitrogen fertilization rates (0, 90 and 150 Kgha<sup>-1</sup> N) on mycotoxin contamination (DON vs. FB vs. AFB1) in the kernels of three (3) maize hybrids: DKC4590 (tolerant), GKT376 (sensitive), and P9610 (undefined). The results showed a significant (<i>p</i> = 0.05) influence of nitrogen fertilization and maize genotype on mycotoxin levels. Sole nitrogen impacts were complex and did not define a clear trend, contrary to the hybrids selected, which followed superiority to resistance. Increased nitrogen fertilization was associated with higher DON production, while hybrid selection demonstrated a clearer trend in resistance to mycotoxins. Therefore, to maximize yield and minimize mycotoxin contamination, future research should focus on optimizing nitrogen application rates and breeding for resistance to balance yield and mycotoxin management. These results suggest that while nitrogen fertilization is crucial for maximizing yield, selecting less susceptible maize hybrids remains vital for minimizing mycotoxin contamination.","Maize plays a significant global role as a food source, feed, and as a raw material in industry.

Cohort and case-control studies assessing biomarkers for the prediction of bacterial, viral, or fungal infection in immunocompromised children vs. conventional microbiological investigations were eligible. Studies including adult patients were eligible if pediatric data were separately assessable. Data on definitions used for infections, fever, and neutropenia and predictive values were collected. Risk of bias was assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-two studies involving 13,939 febrile episodes in 7,059 children were included. In total, 92.2% were in cancer patients (<i>n</i> = 48), and 15.7% also included hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients (<i>n</i> = 8). Forty-three biomarkers were investigated, of which 6 (CRP, PCT, IL-8, IL-6, IL-10, and TNFα) were significantly associated with bacterial infection at admission, studied in multiple studies, and provided predictive data. Literature on the prediction of viral and fungal infection was too limited. Eight studies compared C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), with PCT demonstrating superiority in 5. IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were compared with CRP in six, four, and one study, respectively, with mixed results on diagnostic superiority. No clear superior biomarker comparing PCT vs. IL-6, IL-8, or IL-10 was identified.<h4>Discussion</h4>There is great heterogeneity in the biomarkers studied and cutoff values and definitions used, thus complicating the analysis. Literature for immunocompromised children with non-malignant disease and for non-bacterial infection is sparse. Literature on novel diagnostics was not available. We illustrated the challenges of diagnosing fever adequately in this study population and the need for improved biomarkers and clinical decision-making tools.","<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to assess the performance of biomarkers used for the prediction of bacterial, viral, and fungal infection in immunocompromised children upon presentation with fever.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a literature search using PubMed and MEDLINE and In-Process & Other Non-indexed Citations databases.

10.3390/jof10030202,Aphids May Facilitate the Spread of Sclerotinia Stem Rot in Oilseed Rape by Carrying and Depositing Ascospores.,"Aphids and Sclerotinia stem rot in oilseed rape are often studied in isolation, and their relationship is rarely explored. Our field studies have revealed a significant positive correlation between the number of aphids and the incidence of Sclerotinia stem rot. Hence, starting with the colonizing stages of the two pests, <i>Breveroryne brassicae</i> was assessed for its potential to acquire, transmit, and inoculate <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> by being sprayed with an ascospore suspension. Moreover, distinctions in aphid feeding behavior were examined between aphids on inoculated/uninoculated winter and spring oilseed rape plants or aphids, both with and without <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> ascospores, using electropenetrography (EPG). The results showed that aphid feeding followed by dropping ascospore suspension significantly increased the incidence of <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>. Ascospores were able to adhere to aphids and were carried by aphids to healthy plants, causing disease. The results of the EPG analysis indicated that aphid feeding behavior was significantly altered in all leaf tissue levels following infection with <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>. Specifically, aphids initiated their first puncture significantly sooner, began probing mesophyll cells earlier, had a significantly shorter pathway duration, and secreted saliva more frequently but reduced salivation prior to feeding and ingestion compared to aphids feeding on uninfected oilseed rape. Additionally, the feeding behavior of aphids carrying ascospores was markedly different from that of aphids not carrying ascospores, implying that ascospores directly influence aphid feeding behavior but that this influence appeared to be beneficial only for <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> infection. Aphids carrying ascospores started to puncture cells more quickly, with a significant increase in the frequency and duration of short probes and cell punctures, shortened pathway durations, and reduced salivation before feeding compared to aphids not carrying ascospores. It is clear that there is an interaction between aphids and <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>. The impact of <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> on aphid feeding behavior is directional, favoring the spread of the fungus.","Aphids and Sclerotinia stem rot in oilseed rape are often studied in isolation, and their relationship is rarely explored.

Currently, a strict lifelong gluten-free diet is the cornerstone of treatment of coeliac disease. However, maintaining strict dietary adherence is challenging for many patients, due to the high costs, the highly restrictive nature of the diet and the impact on patients' quality of life. Moreover, a tiny minority of coeliac patients can develop pre-malignant/malignant complications of coeliac disease, a group of conditions, that despite being rare, are still burdened by a poor prognosis due to the lack of effective therapies. Therefore, the development of pharmacological treatments as an alternative to or supportive of a gluten-free diet is still an unmet need. The identification of new pathogenetic targets in the last years has enabled the development of several candidates molecules, many of which have been investigated in phase 2/3 clinical trials.

Mandating coccidioidomycosis as a reportable disease across more US states would increase disease awareness, improve clinical outcomes, and help antifungal drug and vaccine development. It would also increase our understanding of where the disease is endemic and the relationships between environmental conditions and disease cases. This is true for other nations in North and South America that are also likely endemic for coccidioidomycosis, especially Mexico.

10.3390/jof9090943,Alternative Non-Mammalian Animal and Cellular Methods for the Study of Host-Fungal Interactions.,"In the study of fungal pathogenesis, alternative methods have gained prominence due to recent global legislation restricting the use of mammalian animals in research. The principle of the 3 Rs (replacement, reduction, and refinement) is integrated into regulations and guidelines governing animal experimentation in nearly all countries. This principle advocates substituting vertebrate animals with other invertebrate organisms, embryos, microorganisms, or cell cultures. This review addresses host-fungus interactions by employing three-dimensional (3D) cultures, which offer more faithful replication of the in vivo environment, and by utilizing alternative animal models to replace traditional mammals. Among these alternative models, species like <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and <i>Danio rerio</i> share approximately 75% of their genes with humans. Furthermore, models such as <i>Galleria mellonella</i> and <i>Tenebrio molitor</i> demonstrate similarities in their innate immune systems as well as anatomical and physiological barriers, resembling those found in mammalian organisms.","In the study of fungal pathogenesis, alternative methods have gained prominence due to recent global legislation restricting the use of mammalian animals in research.

However, the low solubility of ITZ significantly reduces its oral bioavailability. Furthermore, it has been reported that this medication can result in dose-related adverse effects. Therefore, the objective of this study was to enhance the solubility of ITZ through the utilization of various polymers and to manufacture personalized and programmable release ITZ tablets. Five different polymers were selected as water-soluble carriers. Thirty percent <i>w</i>/<i>w</i> ITZ was mixed with seventy percent <i>w</i>/<i>w</i> of the polymers, which were then extruded. A series of physical and chemical characterization studies were conducted, including DSC, PXRD, PLM, and in vitro drug release studies. The results demonstrated that ITZ was dispersed within the polymers, forming ASDs that markedly enhanced its solubility and dissolution rate. Consequently, soluplus<sup>®</sup> was employed as the polymer for the extrusion of ITZ-loaded filaments, which were subsequently designed and printed. The in vitro drug release studies indicated that the release of ITZ could be regulated by modifying the 3D structure design.

In this study, a series of newly designed and synthesized benzanilide-containing azoles exhibited promising antifungal activity against fluconazole-sensitive <i>Candida albicans</i>. Importantly, the newly synthesized compounds also displayed potent activity against azole-resistant strains, surpassing the performance of the positive control fluconazole. This suggests that these compounds may have the potential to combat drug-resistant fungal infections. Subsequent studies on the antifungal mechanisms revealed that the compound can inhibit fungal CYP51, thereby blocking ergosterol biosynthesis. Morphological observations of fungal cells further confirmed CYP51 as the target of action. Resistance mechanisms elucidated that these compounds can inhibit biofilm formation and the expression of resistance-related genes ERG11 and efflux pump gene CDR1, thereby reversing resistance. Meanwhile, the most potent compound A11 demonstrated the ability to stimulate reactive oxygen species, thereby exhibiting potent fungicidal activity. Furthermore, the compound A11 also showed good stability in liver microsomes and plasma metabolism. Cytotoxicity studies demonstrated low toxicity of the compounds against MRC-5 cells, indicating their potential safety for therapeutic use. <i>In vivo</i> experimental results indicated that the representative compound A11 significantly inhibited fungal infections caused by resistant strains.

We investigated the effects of Metarhizium robertsii fungus and avermectins on the midgut physiology of Colorado potato beetle larvae. We analyzed changes in the bacterial community, immunity- and stress-related gene expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and detoxification enzyme activity in response to topical infection with the M. robertsii fungus, oral administration of avermectins, and a combination of the two treatments. Avermectin treatment led to a reduction in microbiota diversity and an enhancement in the abundance of enterobacteria, and these changes were followed by the downregulation of Stat and Hsp90, upregulation of transcription factors for the Toll and IMD pathways and activation of detoxification enzymes. Fungal infection also led to a decrease in microbiota diversity, although the changes in community structure were not significant, except for the enhancement of Serratia. Fungal infection decreased the production of ROS but did not affect the gene expression of the immune pathways. In the combined treatment, fungal infection inhibited the activation of detoxification enzymes and prevented the downregulation of the JAK-STAT pathway caused by avermectins. The results of this study suggest that fungal infection modulates physiological responses to avermectins and that fungal infection may increase avermectin toxicosis by blocking detoxification enzymes in the gut.","Fungal infections and toxicoses caused by insecticides may alter microbial communities and immune responses in the insect gut.

Accurate diagnosis of CVDs is essential to guide therapeutic decisions and foresee the prognosis. Different CVDs have different pathological processes while they have many signs in common with some other brain diseases. Thus, differential diagnoses of strokes from other primary and secondary CVDs are especially important and challenging.<h4>Methods</h4>This review is composed mainly based on searching PubMed articles between September, 2013 and December 26, 2022 in English.<h4>Key content and findings</h4>Neuroimaging is a powerful tool for CVD diagnosis including cerebral angiography, ultrasound, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI excels other imaging techniques by its features of non-invasive, diverse sequences and high spatiotemporal resolution. It can detect hemodynamic, structural alterations of intracranial arteries and metabolic status of their associated brain regions. In acute stroke, differential diagnosis of ischemic from hemorrhagic stroke and other intracranial vasculopathies is a common application of MRI. By providing information about the pathological characteristics of cerebral diseases exhibiting different degrees of behavioral alterations, cognitive impairment, motor dysfunction and other indications, MRI can differentiate strokes from other primary CVDs involving cerebral small vessels and identify vascular dementia from hyponatremia, brain tumors and other secondary or non-primary CVDs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Recent advances in MRI technology allow clinical neuroimaging to provide unique reference for differentiating many previously inconclusive CVDs. MRI technology is worthy of full exploration while breaking its limitations in clinical applications should be considered.","<h4>Background and objective</h4>Cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs), particularly cerebral stroke, remain a primary cause of disability and death worldwide.

10.7759/cureus.22927,A Systematic Review on the Prevention and Control of Opportunistic Infections in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Complicated by Richter's Transformation.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the most commonly occurring types of leukemia among the elderly population, contributing to an increased vulnerability to infections that are especially prolific in the immunosuppressed and the risk of rapid progression of the disease into a more aggressive manifestation of large cell lymphoma, a process called Richter's Transformation (RT). CLL alone predisposes patients to develop infections; however, the additional complication of RT decreases survival and makes the prevention and control of infection for the CLL patient even more challenging. However, research that exists on preventing and controlling infection in CLL patients with RT is relatively limited. In most cases, studies have focused on the prevention of infection in CLL patients in general and with no reference to the progression of RT. Considering the dearth of research on infection prevention and control for patients with CLL complicated by RT specifically, the following review examines existing research in addressing the prevention and control of infection in CLL patients with RT and patients in general. The authors explored multiple databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct. The ultimate focus of this study was to lay a fundamental understanding in preventing and controlling infection in CLL patients. After analyzing several studies, it can be concluded that identifying infections, even if rare, is a crucial aspect of managing CLL patients. A broad range of differential diagnoses should be sought in cases presenting with refractory CLL as well and management of infections before, during, or after CLL treatment should be considered.","Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the most commonly occurring types of leukemia among the elderly population, contributing to an increased vulnerability to infections that are especially prolific in the immunosuppressed and the risk of rapid progression of the disease into a more aggressive manifestation of large cell lymphoma, a process called Richter's Transformation (RT).

10.3390/ijerph18063005,Expanding Our Understanding of COVID-19 from Biomedical Literature Using Word Embedding.,"A better understanding of the clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is urgently required to address this health crisis. Numerous researchers and pharmaceutical companies are working on developing vaccines and treatments; however, a clear solution has yet to be found. The current study proposes the use of artificial intelligence methods to comprehend biomedical knowledge and infer the characteristics of COVID-19. A biomedical knowledge base was established via FastText, a word embedding technique, using PubMed literature from the past decade. Subsequently, a new knowledge base was created using recently published COVID-19 articles. Using this newly constructed knowledge base from the word embedding model, a list of anti-infective drugs and proteins of either human or coronavirus origin were inferred to be related, because they are located close to COVID-19 on the knowledge base. This study attempted to form a method to quickly infer related information about COVID-19 using the existing knowledge base, before sufficient knowledge about COVID-19 is accumulated. With COVID-19 not completely overcome, machine learning-based research in the PubMed literature will provide a broad guideline for researchers and pharmaceutical companies working on treatments for COVID-19.","A better understanding of the clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is urgently required to address this health crisis.

In this work, a vacuum infiltration seed priming strategy was developed to incorporate silica nanoparticles into soybeans. Although successful in initial greenhouse and field studies, little is known about the amount of nutrient being delivered and the conditions for optimum accumulation. Herein, various infiltration conditions were evaluated using fluorescent silica nanoparticles and confocal microscopy, including nanoparticle surface charge and concentration, infiltration time, infiltrate ionic strength and pH, and seed presoaking. Negative nanoparticle surface charge, higher nanoparticle concentration, shorter infiltration time, and potassium-based salts resulted in greater nanoparticle infiltration. Seed coat elemental analysis complemented fluorescence data and highlighted the co-delivery of beneficial macronutrients including potassium and magnesium under ionic salt infiltration conditions. Overall, these findings illustrate a new strategy to biofortify nanoscale nutrients into soybean seeds that can be expanded into other agrochemical targets and crop species to promote sustainable agriculture.","Agrochemical delivery is highly inefficient, and novel application methods are necessary to promote crop health and yields while reducing environmental impact.

The present study was conducted to assess the effect of epigeic earthworms Perionyx excavatus and Eisenia. fetida on soil nutrients and the consequent improvement of biomass productivity and yield of Capsicum chinense Jacq and Zea mays L. The experiment was conducted in 5 L and 15 L capacity plastic pots for C. chinense and Z. mays with 150 g and 300 g of half-decomposed cow dung, respectively. It was observed that the weekly harvest rate of ripened chili was 17.59 g, 13.91 g, and 9.24 g in P. excavatus, control, and E. fetida pot showing 26.49% higher in P. excavatus. Also, the total kernel count per corn was significantly different (F<sub>(2, 9)</sub> = 37.78, p < 0.05), with the highest kernel present in P. excavatus(333.5 ± 13.5), followed by E. fetida(261.5 ± 16.5) and control (235 ± 22). The impact of P. excavatus was more perceptible in C. chinense, indicated by higher leaf biomass (69.16%), root length (30.14%), and fruit harvest (71.03%). However, the effect of E. fetida was noticed more in Z. mays (stem length, 19.24%, stem biomass, 14.39%, root biomass, 20.9%, kernel count, 41.91%, and kernel weight, 95.07%). Enhanced plant productivity was also supported by an increasing soil nutrient turnover in organic carbon (OC) (25.76% and 23.4%), Phosphorus (P) (31.03% and 25.67%), and Potassium (K) (41.67% and 12.26) in P. excavatus and E. fetida worked soil respectively.

10.3389/fped.2023.1011723,Metagenomics by next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in the etiological characterization of neonatal and pediatric sepsis: A systematic review.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Pediatric and neonatal sepsis is one of the main causes of mortality and morbidity in these age groups. Accurate and early etiological identification is essential for guiding antibiotic treatment, improving survival, and reducing complications and sequelae. Currently, the identification is based on culture-dependent methods, which has many limitations for its use in clinical practice, and obtaining its results is delayed. Next-generation sequencing enables rapid, accurate, and unbiased identification of multiple microorganisms in biological samples at the same time. The objective of this study was to characterize the etiology of neonatal and pediatric sepsis by metagenomic techniques.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review of the literature was carried out using the PRISMA-2020 guide. Observational, descriptive, and case report studies on pediatric patients were included, with a diagnostic evaluation by clinical criteria of sepsis based on the systemic inflammatory response, in sterile and non-sterile biofluid samples. The risk of bias assessment of the observational studies was carried out with the STROBE-metagenomics instrument and the CARE checklist for case reports.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>Five studies with a total of 462 patients were included. Due to the data obtained from the studies, it was not possible to perform a quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis). Based on the data from the included studies, the result identified that mNGS improves the etiological identification in neonatal and pediatric sepsis, especially in the context of negative cultures and in the identification of unusual microorganisms (bacteria that are difficult to grow in culture, viruses, fungi, and parasites). The number of investigations is currently limited, and the studies are at high risk of bias. Further research using this technology would have the potential to improve the rational use of antibiotics.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Pediatric and neonatal sepsis is one of the main causes of mortality and morbidity in these age groups.

The presence of a bony defect in either the maxilla or mandible might lead to variations in the stress distribution. The aim of this study was to evaluate the stress distribution and variations in stress trajectories from biting forces in a human skull with maxillofacial defect using a finite element (FE) model.<h4>Methodology</h4>In this study, a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) of an adult male patient with a maxillectomy defect consequent to surgical treatment of mucormycosis is evaluated for the stress distribution from the biting forces of the remaining posterior teeth. Finite element model without the mandible was constructed from the patient's CBCT data. Occlusal loading forces of 600 N were applied on each side of the maxillary teeth. Stress trajectories were visualised through the stress distribution pattern.<h4>Results</h4>The results showed deviations in the normal stress distribution during occlusal loading and variations in zygomatic and pterygoid stress trajectories in the maxillofacial and skull regions in our FE model due to the bony defect.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We conclude that a skeletal maxillofacial defect should be reconstructed to resume proper stress distribution during functional forces to maintain a healthy craniofacial skeleton.","<h4>Background and aim</h4>Biting forces from the teeth are distributed to the facial bones and to the skull through the stress trajectories.

Patients with retroperitoneal lymphadenectasis showed decreased NK cell counts (<i>p</i> = 0.03).<h4>Conclusion</h4>In summary, the <i>T.marneffei</i> infection of LNs in HIV patients often manifests with superficial LN enlargement, mostly affecting the cervical LNs. The <i>T.marneffei</i>-infected LNs exhibit several characteristics such as echogenicity, hilum, and blood flow signal. Furthermore, there might be associations between lymphocyte subsets and enlarged superficial LNs. Ultrasound examinations should be paid attention to if patients have superficial LN enlargement, and the diagnosis of the <i>T.marneffei</i> infection is considered.",EuropePMC
10.3390/insects14060534,Mild Winter Causes Increased Mortality in the Fall Webworm <i>Hyphantria cunea</i> (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae).,"The fall webworm <i>Hyphantria cunea</i> (Drury) is native to North America and Mexico and has currently expanded its distribution to the temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere including Japan. According to the data on seasonal fluctuations of this moth for 18 years collected in western-central Japan, the abundance of adults of the overwintered generation showed a negative correlation with winter temperature. We investigated survival, weight loss, and fungal infection of diapausing pupae at 3.0 (an approximate temperature of cold winter) and 7.4 °C (a temperature of mild winter). In the results, mortality was higher and weight loss was larger in pupae exposed to 7.4 °C than in those exposed to 3.0 °C. In addition, pupae that were heavier at the start of cold exposure survived longer than lighter ones. Furthermore, almost all pupae that died at 7.4 °C were infected by fungi. It has been reported that the distribution range of this moth shifts to higher latitudes. According to the experiments conducted, it has been observed that warm winters can lead to a decrease in pupae weight and an increase in fungal deaths; however, the impact of warm winters on populations in the field can be more complicated and multifaceted.","The fall webworm <i>Hyphantria cunea</i> (Drury) is native to North America and Mexico and has currently expanded its distribution to the temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere including Japan.

Only few antifungals are available, and some of these fail to treat intrinsically resistant species and the ever-increasing number of fungal strains that have acquired resistance. In nature, bacteria and fungi display versatile interactions that range from friendly co-existence to predation. The first antifungal drugs, nystatin and amphotericin B, were discovered in bacteria as mediators of such interactions, and bacteria continue to be an important source of antifungals. To learn more about the ecological bacterial-fungal interactions that drive the evolution of natural products and exploit them, we need to identify environments where such interactions are pronounced, and diverse. Here, we systematically analyze historic and recent developments in this field to identify potentially under-investigated niches and resources. We also discuss alternative strategies to treat fungal infections by utilizing the antagonistic potential of bacteria to target fungal stress pathways and virulence factors, and thereby suppress the evolution of antifungal resistance.","Many fungi can cause deadly diseases in humans, and nearly every human will suffer from some kind of fungal infection in their lives.

10.3390/jof9040396,Relationship of Sporotrichosis and Infected Patients with HIV-AIDS: An Actual Systematic Review.,"<h4>Background</h4>Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection that can affect both humans and animals, caused by a species of thermo-dimorphic fungi of the genus <i>Sporothrix</i>. This pathology can be acquired by subcutaneous traumatic inoculation through contact with contaminated plants, soil or decomposing organic matter, and/or by inhalation of conidia. The infection can progress to chronic skin infection, or it can even spread to blood vessels, lymph, muscles, bones, and other organs, such as the lungs and nervous system. Those disseminated types are usually associated with cellular immunodeficiency and infection by inhalation, which explains why people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) get infected in such a manner. This virus changes the natural history of sporotrichosis, producing a greater fungal load.<h4>Methods</h4>The search was carried out in three databases: Pubmed, Scopus, and Scielo.

Research shows that the potato cultivar YouJin is especially vulnerable to PVY and displays severe symptoms, including leaf vein chlorosis, curled leaf margins, large necrotic spots on the leaf blades, and the growth of small new leaves.<h4>Methods</h4>PVY infection in potato cultivar YouJin was confirmed through symptom observation, RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis. Transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze the genes associated with PVY pathogenesis in this cultivar.<h4>Result</h4>Transcriptome analysis of differential genes was conducted in this study to examine the pathogenesis of PVY on YouJin. The results showed that 1,949 genes were differentially regulated, including 853 upregulated genes and 1,096 downregulated genes. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis indicated that carbohydrate synthesis and metabolism pathways were suppressed, and electron transferase and hydrolase activities were reduced. Moreover, there were increased expression levels of protein kinase genes. By focusing on plant-pathogen interaction pathways, six core genes all upregulating the WARK family of transcription factors were obtained. Additionally, a constructed PPI network revealed the identification of key modular differential genes, such as downregulated photosynthesis-related protein genes and upregulated AP2/ERF-ERF transcription factors. Functional network enrichment analysis revealed that PVY infection limited RNA metabolism, glutathionylation, and peroxiredoxin activity while triggering the expression of associated defense genes in YouJin. After analyzing the above, 26 DEGs were screened and 12 DEGs were confirmed via RT-qPCR.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These results establish a hypothetical framework for clarifying the pathogenesis of PVY in the YouJin variety of potatoes, which will help design the disease resistance of YouJin.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Potatoes (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i> L.) can be infected by various viruses, but out of all of viruses, the potato virus Y (PVY) is the most detrimental.

Optimized nanogels were incorporated into 1% HPMC gel and then evaluated in comparison with Lamisil cream 1% for TBH stratum corneum retention, skin irritation, and in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity studies. Optimized nanogels (AAG 7) demonstrated a 255 nm particle size, 82.37% DEE, pH-dependent swelling, 92.15% of drug release (pH) 7.4 within 12 h, and a larger zone of inhibition compared to Lamisil cream.

In case of reactivation with more than one Herpes virus mortality among patients were detected along with single viral infection in some studies. Significant association was noted in dosage and usage of steroid and Herpesviridae reactivation in COVID-19 patients. Blood markers such as D-dimer, CRP along with length of stay in the ICU and usage of invasive mechanical ventilation were found to be the significantly associated markers.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Findings from this study will aid clinicians to assess and treat COVID-19 cases with co-infections.",EuropePMC
10.1371/journal.pntd.0012623,Itraconazole resistance in Madurella fahalii linked to a distinct homolog of the gene encoding cytochrome P450 14-α sterol demethylase (CYP51).,"<h4>Background</h4>Mycetoma is a deep fungal infection caused by several microorganisms, with Madurella mycetomatis being the most common causative agent. Another related species, Madurella fahalii, is also known to cause eumycetoma. However, unlike M. mycetomatis, M. fahalii exhibits resistance to itraconazole, the standard treatment for eumycetoma, and the underlying cause of this resistance remains unknown. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of this resistance is critical for developing more effective therapies.<h4>Principal findings</h4>Using the high-quality draft genome sequence of Madurella fahalii IFM 68171, we identified two copies of the gene encoding cytochrome P450 14-α sterol demethylase (CYP51), the target enzyme of itraconazole. These include a gene conserved among Madurella species (Mfcyp51A1) and a M. fahalii-specific gene (Mfcyp51A2). Both genes are actively transcribed in M. fahalii and are upregulated in response to itraconazole. Furthermore, heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that transformants carrying the Mfcyp51A2 gene exhibited reduced susceptibility to itraconazole compared to those with Mfcyp51A1.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We demonstrated that itraconazole resistance in M. fahalii may be attributed to the presence of an additional CYP51 gene. This study represents the first report on the physiological characteristics of Madurella species using genetic engineering techniques.","<h4>Background</h4>Mycetoma is a deep fungal infection caused by several microorganisms, with Madurella mycetomatis being the most common causative agent.

These areas are characterized by intensive human activities, such as tourism, fishery, and marine traffic, all possibly involved in the influence of the use of coastal habitat by marine species. These anthropic threats, in addition to the natural ones and the changing environmental characteristics of the beach, may influence the growth of microorganisms causing hatching failures. Among microorganisms, fungal infection by the genus Fusarium (Link, 1809) is considered one of the main causes of globally declining sea turtle populations. In summer 2021, the two northernmost worldwide loggerhead sea turtle nests were monitored along the Northern Adriatic coastline (Veneto, Italy). These first records may potentially candidate this area as suitable for a large part of the loggerhead turtle's life cycle and it could represent a minor sea turtle nesting area that, according to Prato and colleagues, remained unnoticed due to the lack of specific monitoring. Sea Turtle Egg Fusariosis (STEF) was deemed to have deeply compromised the hatching success of the northmost one. Climate change and anthropogenic impacts have been scored as one of the highest hazards to sea turtle health and could have played a role in the STEF development. Environmental changes, human activities, and emerging pathogens deserve the highest attention in terms of health research, and conservation management.","In recent years, the report of loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) Mediterranean nesting range has expanded together with new records of nests becoming northward on the Italian coastline of the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic seas.

Isavuconazole is a novel broad-spectrum azole active against <i>Aspergillus</i> spp. and Mucor, well tolerated, with an excellent bioavailability and predictable pharmacokinetics, that penetrates in most tissues rapidly, and has few serious adverse effects, including hepatic toxicity. Contrary to other broad-spectrum azoles, such as voriconazole and posaconazole, isavuconazole appears to show significant smaller drug-drug interactions with anticalcineurin drugs. We have performed an extensive literature review of the experience with the use of isavuconazole in SOT, which included the SOTIS and the ISASOT studies, and published case reports. More than 140 SOT recipients treated with isavuconazole for IMD were included. Most patients were lung and kidney recipients treated for an <i>Aspergillus</i> infection. Isavuconazole was well tolerated (less than 10% of patients required treatment discontinuation). The clinical responses appeared comparable to that found in other high-risk patient populations. Drug-drug interactions with immunosuppressive agents were manageable after the reduction of tacrolimus and the adjustment of mTOR inhibitors at the beginning of treatment. In conclusion, isavuconazole appears to be a reasonable option for the treatment of IMD in SOT. More clinical studies are warranted.","Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients have a higher risk of developing invasive mould diseases (IMD).

(2) Methods: A nanostructure lipid carrier (NLC), as a second generation of solid lipid nanoparticles, was used as a carrier to deliver the active components of curcumin (Cur), geraniol (G), and linalool (L) in one nanoformulation after studying their applicability in replacing the co-crystallized ligand imidacloprid. (3) Results: The prepared nanostructure showed spherical-shaped, polydisperse particles ranging in size from 50 nm to 300 nm, as found using a transmission electron microscope. Additionally, dynamic light scattering confirmed an average size of 169 nm and a highly stable dispersed solution, as indicated by the zeta potential (-38 mV). The prepared NLC-Cur-LG displayed competitive, high-malignancy insecticidal activity against fourth instar <i>C. pipiens</i> with an elevated rate of death of 0.649 µg/mL. The treatment, due to the prepared nanostructure, affects oxidative stress enzymes, e.g., hydrogen peroxide (4 ppm), superoxide dismutase (SOD) (0.03 OD/mg), and protein carbonyl (0.08 OD/mg), and there are observable upward and downward fluctuations when using different concentrations of NLC-Cur-LG, suggesting significant problems in its foreseeable insecticidal activity. The acetylcholinesterase activity was assessed by an enzyme inhibition assay, and strengthened inhibition occurred due to the encapsulated NLCs (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.95 µg/mL). An investigation of the gene expression by Western blotting, due to treatment with NLC-Cur-LG, revealed a severe reduction of nearly a quarter of what was seen in the untreated group.

The imprinted polymers were synthesised in the presence of AuNP precursors in a pre-polymerisation mixture, which were confined to one another during the polymerisation of the chains. This allowed the formation of hybrid electroactive responsive imprinted nanoparticles (hybrid AuNPs@GA-nanoMIP), which exhibited enhanced electron conductivity. The morphological characterisation of the produced nanoMIPs revealed a fully decorated Au spherical surface of 200 nm in diameter. This resulted in a large active surface area distribution, as well a pronounced electrochemical peak response at the commercial screen-printed platinum electrode (SPPtE), accompanied by enhanced electron kinetics. The AuNPs@GA-nanoMIP sensor demonstrated the ability to detect a broad range of GA concentrations (0.025-5 mg/mL) with exceptional selectivity and reproducibility.

Besides, the indiscriminate use of antifungals in both clinics and agriculture has promoted antifungal drug resistance in the last decade. Fungi can show drug resistance by a variety of mechanisms. But primary driver in all these hitherto documented mechanisms is stable and heritable point mutations in the key proteins. Therefore, cataloguing mutations that can confer resistance is the first step toward understanding the mechanisms leading to the emergence of antifungal resistance.<h4>Results</h4>In the present, work we have described a database of all the mutations responsible for antifungal resistance. Named as antifungal resistance database (AFRbase), it is better than the existing databases of antifungal resistance namely, FunResDB and MARDy which have a limited scope and inadequate information. Data of AFRbase was collected using both text mining and manual curation. AFRbase provides a separate window for visualization of mutations in the 2D and 3D formats making it easy for researchers to analyze the mutation data and ensures interoperability with other standard molecular biology databases like NCBI and UniProtKB. We hope AFRbase can be useful to both clinicians and basic biomedical scientists as we envision it as an important resource for genotypic susceptibility testing of fungi and to study/predict the course of evolution of antifungal resistance. The current version of AFRbase contains manually curated 3691 unique mutations present in 29 proteins of 32 fungal species along with the information of drugs against which resistance is caused.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>AFRbase is an open access database available at http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/afrbase/.","<h4>Motivation</h4>Fungal pathogens are known to cause life threatening invasive infections with rising global mortality rates.

This unique characteristic makes EPF especially relevant for the control of cryptic insects. In the case of the red palm weevil (RPW) <i>Rhynchophorus ferrugineus</i>, the eggs and larvae are almost inaccessible to direct-contact treatment. The objective of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of conidia transmission from a treated surface to host eggs and larvae. Foam pieces infested with <i>Metarhizium brunneum</i> conidial powder, conidial suspension, or distilled water were used as a laying surface for RPW females. The number of eggs laid was not affected by the EPF treatments and ranged from 2 to 14 eggs per female. However, hatching rate and larval survival were significantly reduced in the conidial powder treatment, resulted in 1.5% hatching and no live larvae. In the conidial suspension treatment, 21% of laid eggs hatched, compared to 72% in the control treatment. In both <i>M. brunneum</i> treatments, females' proboscis, front legs and ovipositor were covered with conidia. The females transferred conidia in both treatments to the laying holes, reaching up to 15 mm in depth. This resulted in reduced egg-hatching rate and significant larval mortality due to fungal infection. The stronger effect on egg and larval survival using dry conidia seemed to result from better conidial adhesion to the female weevil in this formulation.

Current pharmacological and surgical treatments often have side effects and are limited in their ability to regenerate hair follicles (HF). Therefore, effective solutions for alopecia remain elusive. We developed an innovative hair tonic capable of stimulating HF regeneration by harnessing abandoned electric energy generated during human activities, such as the frictional electric field from walking and the electric fields from electronic devices. We devised a convenient, non-volatile, and conductive hair tonic to capture these naturally occurring electric fields. We identified 6-pentyl-α-pyrone (6PP) from <i>Trichoderma gamsii</i> as an antifungal agent effective against the dandruff-associated fungus <i>Malassezia</i> that can influence alopecia and adopted it into our conductive bio-harvesting tonic (CBT). Testing on hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPC) and SKH1 mice showed that CBT significantly enhanced HF proliferation and increased growth factors <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. In SKH1 mice, application of CBT under electric stimulation visibly increased hair shaft length and follicle counts. Additionally, tests on actual human hair follicles demonstrated delayed hair follicle regression when electric stimulation and 6PP were applied. In conclusion, our innovative CBT offers a promising and convenient approach for improving hair growth and combating alopecia.","Alopecia, while not life-threatening, significantly impacts mental health, identity, and self-esteem of those afflicted.

10.1371/journal.pone.0302055,Protocol for the systematic review of the Pneumocystis jirovecii-associated pneumonia in non-HIV immunocompromised patients.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is a well-known and frequent opportunistic infection in HIV patients. However, there has been an increase in the number of reports of PJP in other immunosuppressed patients with autoimmune inflammatory disorders or because of chemotherapy and high doses of steroids, especially when used in combination as part of immunosuppressive therapy.<h4>Objective</h4>Despite the increasing importance of PJP in non-HIV patients, there is a lack of comprehensive and updated information on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, microbiology, treatments, and prophylaxis of this infection in this population. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review is to synthesize information on these aspects, from a perspective of evidence-based medicine.<h4>Methods</h4>The protocol is prepared following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA-P) guidelines. We will perform a systematic review of literature published between January 2010 and July 2023, using the databases PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. In addition, manual searches will be carried out through related articles, and references to included articles. The main findings and clinical outcomes were extracted from all the eligible studies with a standardized instrument. Two authors will independently screen titles and abstracts, review full texts, and collect data.

Furthermore, the study will highlight possible gaps in knowledge that should be addressed through new research.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Here, we present the protocol for a systematic review which will consider all existing evidence from peer-reviewed publication sources relevant to the primary and secondary outcomes related to diagnosing and managing PJP in non-HIV patients.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is a well-known and frequent opportunistic infection in HIV patients. However, there has been an increase in the number of reports of PJP in other immunosuppressed patients with autoimmune inflammatory disorders or because of chemotherapy and high doses of steroids, especially when used in combination as part of immunosuppressive therapy.<h4>Objective</h4>Despite the increasing importance of PJP in non-HIV patients, there is a lack of comprehensive and updated information on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, microbiology, treatments, and prophylaxis of this infection in this population. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review is to synthesize information on these aspects, from a perspective of evidence-based medicine.<h4>Methods</h4>The protocol is prepared following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA-P) guidelines. We will perform a systematic review of literature published between January 2010 and July 2023, using the databases PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. In addition, manual searches will be carried out through related articles, and references to included articles. The main findings and clinical outcomes were extracted from all the eligible studies with a standardized instrument. Two authors will independently screen titles and abstracts, review full texts, and collect data. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion, and a third reviewer will decide if there is no consensus. We will synthesize the results using a narrative or a meta-analytic approach, depending on the heterogeneity of the studies.<h4>Expected results</h4>It is expected that this systematic review will provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the state-of-the-art of PJP in non-HIV patients.

10.3389/finsc.2023.1260333,The immunostimulatory role of an <i>Enterococcus-</i>dominated gut microbiota in host protection against bacterial and fungal pathogens in <i>Galleria mellonella</i> larvae.,"Understanding the intricate interplay between the gut microbiota and the immune response in insects is crucial, given its diverse impact on the pathogenesis of various microbial species. The microbiota's modulation of the host immune system is one such mechanism, although its complete impact on immune responses remains elusive. This study investigated the tripartite interaction between the gut microbiota, pathogens, and the host's response in <i>Galleria mellonella</i> larvae reared under axenic (sterile) and conventional (non-sterile) conditions. The influence of the microbiota on host fitness during infections was evaluated via two different routes: oral infection induced by <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> subsp. <i>galleriae</i> (<i>Btg</i>), and topical infection induced by <i>Metarhizium robertsii</i> (<i>Mr</i>). We observed that larvae without a microbiota can successfully fulfill their life cycle, albeit with more variation in their developmental time. We subsequently performed survival assays on final-instar larvae, using the median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) of <i>Btg</i> and <i>Mr</i>. Our findings indicated that axenic larvae were more vulnerable to an oral infection of <i>Btg</i>; specifically, a dose that was calculated to be half-lethal for the conventional group resulted in a 90%-100% mortality rate in the axenic group. Through a dual-analysis experimental design, we could identify the status of the gut microbiota using 16S rRNA sequencing and assess the level of immune-related gene expression in the same group of larvae at basal conditions and during infection. This analysis revealed that the microbiota of our conventionally reared population was dominated entirely by four <i>Enterococcus</i> species, and these species potentially stimulated the immune response in the gut, due to the increased basal expression of two antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)-gallerimycin and gloverin-in the conventional larvae compared with the axenic larvae. Furthermore, <i>Enterococcus mundtii</i>, isolated from the gut of conventional larvae, showed inhibition activity against <i>Btg in vitro</i>. Lastly, other immune effectors, namely, phenoloxidase activity in the hemolymph and total reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) in the gut, were tested to further investigate the extent of the stimulation of the microbiota on the immune response. These findings highlight the immune-modulatory role of the <i>Enterococcus-</i>dominated gut microbiota, an increasingly reported microbiota assemblage of laboratory populations of Lepidoptera, and its influence on the host's response to oral and topical infections.","Understanding the intricate interplay between the gut microbiota and the immune response in insects is crucial, given its diverse impact on the pathogenesis of various microbial species.

A comprehensive literature search yielded 53 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, 2 of which were case studies. The pooled prevalence of C. africana among 20,571 participants was 0.9% (95% CI: 0.7-1.3%), with significant heterogeneity observed (I<sup>2</sup> = 79%, p < 0.01). Subgroup analyses revealed regional variations, with North America showing the highest prevalence (4.6%, 95% CI: 1.8-11.2%). The majority 84.52% of the C. africana have been isolated from vaginal samples, 8.37% from oral samples, 3.77% from urine, 2.09% from glans penis swabs, and 0.42% from rectal swabs, nasal swabs, and respiratory tract expectorations respectively. No C. africana has been isolated from nail samples. Hyphal wall protein 1 gene PCR was the most used diagnostic method for identifying C. africana. It has been used to identify 70% of the isolates. A comparison of methods revealed that the Vitek-2 system consistently failed to differentiate C. africana from Candida albicans, whereas MALDI-TOF misidentified several isolates compared with HWP1 PCR. Factors beyond diagnostic methodology may influence C. africana detection rates. We highlight the importance of adapting molecular methods for resource-limited settings or developing equally accurate but more accessible alternatives for the identification and differentiation of highly similar and cryptic Candida species such as C. africana.","This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated reported prevalence and diagnostic methods for identifying Candida africana, an opportunistic yeast associated with vaginal and oral candidiasis.

In this review, we present the latest studies of freezing biological organisms for biomedical applications. To begin with, the freezing strategies of cryoablation and cryopreservation, as well as their corresponding technical essentials, are illustrated. Besides, biomedical applications of freezing biological organisms are presented, including transplantation, tissue regeneration, anti-infection therapy, and anti-tumor therapy. The challenges and prospects of freezing living organisms for biomedical applications are well discussed.

Our study focused on the microencapsulation of policosanol, the key active component of insect wax, which is a mixture of functional lipids secreted by the <i>Ericerus pela</i> (Chavannes). We developed two innovative policosanol products, microcapsules, and effervescent tablets, and optimized their preparation conditions. We successfully prepared microcapsules containing insect wax-derived policosanol using the spray-drying method. We achieved 92.09% microencapsulation efficiency and 61.67% powder yield under the following conditions: maltodextrin, starch sodium octenyl succinate, and (2-hydroxy)propyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) at a ratio of 1:1:1, core-to-wall materials at a ratio of 1:10, 15% solid content, spray dryer feed temperature at 60 °C, inlet air temperature at 140 °C, and hot-air flow rate at 0.5 m<sup>3</sup>/min. The microcapsules exhibited a regular spherical shape with a minimal water content (1.82%) and rapid dispersion in water (within 143.5 s). These microcapsules released policosanol rapidly in simulated stomach fluid. Moreover, effervescent tablets were prepared using the policosanol-containing microcapsules. The tablets showed low friability (0.32%), quick disintegration in water (within 99.5 s), and high bubble volume. The microcapsules and effervescent tablets developed in this study presented effective solutions to the insolubility of policosanol in water. These products were portable and offered customizable tastes to address the psychological discomfort related to insect-based foods, thus providing a novel strategy for the consumption and secondary processing of insect lipids.","In this study, we addressed various challenges associated with the consumption of functional lipids from the <i>Ericerus pela</i> (Chavannes), including unfavorable taste, insolubility in water, difficulty in oral intake, low bioavailability, and low psychological acceptance.

The hazards associated with mycotoxins are accentuated where food management practices, control, and regulatory systems from farm to plate are sub-optimal. Information on the frequency of these mycotoxins in rice commercialized in markets in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) is limited. The current study examined AF concentrations in 527 rice samples collected from 54 markets in five SSA countries. Grain quality characteristics, processing methods, and origin of samples were contrasted with toxin levels. In total, 72% of the samples had detectable AFs levels (range = 3.0 to 89.8 µg/kg). Forty-seven percent (47%) of the samples had AFs above 4 µg/kg, the European Union maximum level (ML), and were evaluated for cooccurrence with FBs, ZEN, and DON. Total AFs and ZEN cooccurred in 40% of the samples, and 30% of the positive ZEN samples had concentrations above the ML of 75 µg/kg. Total AFs did not co-occur with FBs and DON. Multivariate analysis revealed that length-to-width ratio (p < 0.0001), mixed variety for width (p = 0.04), and chalkiness (p = 0.009) significantly influenced aflatoxin concentrations. Slender grains had higher AFs concentrations than bold and medium grains (p < 0.0001). Possible strategies to mitigate mycotoxin contamination in rice include improving grain quality traits and practicing proper drying and hermetic storage before and after milling. These findings provide valuable insights for both domestic and international actors in establishing and strengthening regulations and management systems to mitigate rice mycotoxin contamination.","Mycotoxins such as aflatoxins (AFs), fumonisins (FBs), zearalenone (ZEN), and deoxynivalenol (DON) pose a risk to public health due to their carcinogenic potency (AFs and FBs) and anti-nutritional effects.

Salvia miltiorrhiza can transmit the signal of resistance to root rot through the jasmonic acid pathway; When plants suffer from disease stress, the content of JA increases significantly, and the increase of JA content will inhibit the content of SA in plants; The gene expression of PR-10 gene in the roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza with arbuscular mycorrhizal network infected by pathogenic fungi was 17.56 times higher than that inoculated only with pathogenic fungi; Changes in hormone content will also cause changes in the expression of related defense genes, such as SnRK2 is inhibited by ABA in the signal transduction pathway, while JA and ABA show antagonistic changes after inoculation of pathogenic fungi in Salvia miltiorrhiza, so JA may positively regulate the expression of SnRK2 gene. Plants can transmit signals through AM hyphal network after being stressed by the pathogen Fusarium solani. In the arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphal network, JA has important significance for the signal transmission of resistance to root rot and disease resistance of Salvia miltiorrhiza, which can make Salvia miltiorrhiza ready for stress resistance and improve the stress resistance of Salvia miltiorrhiza.

In this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate the epidemiology and impact of infections caused by Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp., and Lomentospora prolificans to inform the first FPPL. PubMed and Web of Sciences databases were searched to identify studies published between January 1, 2011 and February 23, 2021, reporting on mortality, complications and sequelae, antifungal susceptibility, preventability, annual incidence, and trends. Overall, 20, 11, and 9 articles were included for Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp., and L. prolificans, respectively. Mortality rates were high in those with invasive fusariosis, scedosporiosis, and lomentosporiosis (42.9%-66.7%, 42.4%-46.9%, and 50.0%-71.4%, respectively). Antifungal susceptibility data, based on small isolate numbers, showed high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC)/minimum effective concentrations for most currently available antifungal agents. The median/mode MIC for itraconazole and isavuconazole were ≥16 mg/l for all three pathogens. Based on limited data, these fungi are emerging. Invasive fusariosis increased from 0.08 cases/100 000 admissions to 0.22 cases/100 000 admissions over the time periods of 2000-2009 and 2010-2015, respectively, and in lung transplant recipients, Scedosporium spp. and L. prolificans were only detected from 2014 onwards.

Although various management techniques and chemical treatments for A. tumida have been developed, understanding the efficacy of these treatments and techniques is limited. Throughout this study, several methods for impairing A. tumida development and delivering insecticidal, repellent, or antifungal treatments were examined. A series of A. tumida larval feeding bioassays developed and optimized feeding gel pellet for delivery of insecticidal treatments, revealing that A. tumida larvae are sensitive to the two common in-hive varroa mite (Varroa destructor) treatments: coumaphos (EC<sub>50</sub> = 25.6 ppm) and tau-fluvalinate (EC<sub>50</sub> = 21.2 ppm). Feeding bioassays also demonstrated that A. tumida were more sensitive to the pyrethroid compounds permethrin (EC<sub>50</sub> = 3.37 ppm), deltamethrin (EC<sub>50</sub> = 2.69 ppm), and bifenthrin (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.365 ppm), which have been previously used to control this beetle. Feeding bioassays also revealed that the antifungal drug Amphotericin B was palatable to A. tumida larvae via feeding, but was also injected into A. tumida larvae and adults. Two types of pupation bioassays were also developed to test the effects of several insecticidal and repellent treatments on pupation burrowing and pupation success. Overall, this work details specific toxicity information regarding common insecticidal treatments found in the apiary setting study and provides groundwork and methods for testing insecticidal compounds on A. tumida larvae in in the future.","European honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies are an ideal host to the invasive beetle Aethina tumida, providing a nutrient rich environment that is protected from the elements and facilitates beetle reproduction.

We recently reported that burning larval zebrafish triggers dysregulated keratinocyte dynamics compared to mechanical injury. Here, we investigate keratinocyte behaviour following burn injury and the subsequent potential for microbial colonisation of burn wounds over time. Real-time imaging, coupled with tracking of photoconverted cells, revealed that early keratinocyte motility contributes to the spread of epithelial damage beyond the initial site of burn injury and that increased epithelial damage was associated with wound colonisation by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Modulating osmotic balance by treating larval zebrafish with isotonic medium limited the spread of epithelial damage and reduced microbial colonisation of burn wounds. Using cultured human skin, we found that topical treatment with isotonic solution (saline) similarly prevented the spread of epithelial damage over time. These findings indicate that keratinocyte behaviour contributes to burn wound progression in larval zebrafish and links keratinocyte dynamics to microbial colonisation of burn wounded tissue.","Burn injuries undergo a complex healing process in which progressive spreading of epithelial damage can lead to secondary complications such as wound infection, which is a major driver of mortality among burn patients.

Its reliability in the diagnosis of community-acquired lung infection has been confirmed. However, its usefulness in identifying infections caused by specific and less common pathogens (e.g., in immunocompromised patients) is still uncertain.<h4>Methods</h4>This systematic review aimed to explore the most common LUS patterns in infections caused by intracellular, fungal pathogens or mycobacteria.<h4>Results</h4>We included 17 studies, reporting a total of 274 patients with <i>M. pneumoniae</i>, 30 with fungal infection and 213 with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Most of the studies on <i>M. pneumoniae</i> in children found a specific LUS pattern, mainly consolidated areas associated with diffuse B lines. The typical LUS pattern in TB consisted of consolidation and small subpleural nodes. Only one study on fungal disease reported LUS specific patterns (e.g., indicating ""halo sign"" or ""reverse halo sign"").<h4>Conclusions</h4>Considering the preliminary data, LUS appears to be a promising point-of-care tool, showing patterns of atypical pneumonia and TB which seem different from patterns characterizing common bacterial infection. The role of LUS in the diagnosis of fungal disease is still at an early stage of exploration.

We aimed to evaluate effects of PAB for AP in a meta-analysis and the need for further research by trial sequential analysis (TSA).<h4>Methods</h4>Medline, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for randomized clinical trials. Primary outcomes were all infections and mortality. Secondary outcomes comprised infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN), specific infections, organ failure, surgical interventions, and length of hospital stay.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-one trials with 1383 pts were included. PAB were received by 703 pts, while 680 were controls. Mortality was similar with RR 0.85 (95% CI 0.66-1.10). Infections were significantly reduced (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.49-0.74), mainly due to decreased risk of sepsis (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.25-0.73) and urinary tract infections (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.25-0.86).

Biological control of crop diseases caused by fungal pathogens is an environment-friendly approach for safeguarding crop production. But the insufficient availability of microbial agents effective against various fungal diseases has hampered the development of green production in crops. In this study, we identified a broad-spectrum antifungal bacterium, <i>Streptomyces graminearus</i> STR-1, showing antagonistic activity to diverse fungal pathogens including <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>, <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>, <i>Ustilaginoidea virens</i>, and <i>Bipolaris maydis</i>. Its antifungal activity was relatively stable and less affected by temperature and pH. Evaluation of the biocontrol activity of STR-1 revealed that STR-1 prevented and controlled rice blast disease via eliciting plant immunity and suppressing fungal infection-structure development. STR-1 broth extract inhibited spore germination, likely through inhibiting protein synthesis. Combining LC-MS and chromatography analysis of the antimicrobial compounds purified from STR-1 broth extract, together with decoding STR-1 genomic sequence, we identified 4-oxo-4-[(1-phenylethyl)amino]but-2-enoic acid, 1,3,5-Trimethylpyrazole and SMA-1 as the potential main STR-1 secondary metabolites associated with its antifungal effects.

In this review, we have discussed the transmission, viral replication, and cytokine storm and highlighted the recent pathological findings of coronavirus disease 2019. The reported severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pathological findings were similar to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Though these findings help notify the clinical course of the disease, it warrants further in vivo and ex vivo studies with larger samples obtained from the coronavirus disease 2019 patients.",EuropePMC
10.3390/insects13121114,Effect of Probiotics on <i>Tenebrio molitor</i> Larval Development and Resistance against the Fungal Pathogen <i>Metarhizium brunneum</i>.,"In recent years, the yellow mealworm (<i>Tenebrio molitor</i> L.) has demonstrated its potential as a mass-produced edible insect for food and feed. However, challenges brought on by pathogens in intensive production systems are unavoidable and require the development of new solutions. One potential solution is the supplementation of probiotics in the insect's diet to obtain the double benefits of improved growth and enhanced immune response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of diet-based probiotic supplementation on <i>T. molitor</i> larval survival, growth, and resistance against a fungal pathogen. Three probiotic strains, namely <i>Pediococcus pentosacceus</i> KVL-B19-01 isolated from <i>T. molitor</i> and two commercialized strains for traditional livestock, <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> 669 and <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> 597, were tested. Additionally, when larvae were 9 weeks old, a pathogen challenge experiment was conducted with the fungus <i>Metarhizium brunneum</i>. Results showed that both <i>P. pentosaceus</i> and <i>E. faecium</i> improved larval growth and larval survival following fungal exposure compared to the non-supplemented control diet. Since <i>B. subtilis</i> did not improve larval performance in terms of either development or protection against <i>M. brunneum</i>, this study suggests the need for further research and evaluation of probiotic strains and their modes of action when considered as a supplement in <i>T. molitor</i>'s diet.","In recent years, the yellow mealworm (<i>Tenebrio molitor</i> L.) has demonstrated its potential as a mass-produced edible insect for food and feed.

10.3390/children11080917,Use of Lung Ultrasound in Cystic Fibrosis: Is It a Valuable Tool?,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disorder characterized by progressive respiratory deterioration, significantly impacting both quality of life and survival. Over the years, lung ultrasound (LUS) has emerged as a promising tool in pediatric respiratory due to its safety profile and ease at the bedside. In the era of highly effective CF modulator therapies and improved life expectancy, the use of non-ionizing radiation techniques could become an integral part of CF management, particularly in the pediatric population. The present review explores the potential role of LUS in CF management based on available data, analyzing all publications from January 2015 to January 2024, focusing on two key areas: LUS in CF pulmonary exacerbation and its utility in routine clinical management. Nonetheless, LUS exhibits a robust correlation with computed tomography (CT) scans and serves as an additional, user-friendly imaging modality in CF management, demonstrating high specificity and sensitivity in identification, especially in consolidations and atelectasis in the CF population. Due to its ability, LUS could be an instrument to monitor exacerbations with consolidations and to establish therapy duration and monitor atelectasis over time or their evolution after therapeutic bronchoalveolar lavage. On the basis of our analysis, sufficient data emerged showing a good correlation between LUS score and respiratory function tests. Good sensitivity and specificity of the methodology have been found in rare CF pulmonary complications such as effusion and pneumothorax. Regarding its use in follow-up management, the literature reports a moderate correlation between LUS scores and the type, extent, and CT severity score of bronchiectasis. A future validation of ultrasound scores specifically in CF patients could improve the use of LUS to identify pulmonary exacerbations and monitor disease progression. However, further research is needed to comprehensively establish the role of LUS in the CF population, particularly in elucidating its broader utility and long-term impact on patient care.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disorder characterized by progressive respiratory deterioration, significantly impacting both quality of life and survival.

Abdominal ultrasonography can be a useful tool in diagnosing cases of fungal infections but may introduce some risks for further infection in vulnerable patients or cause anxiety and discomfort. The aim of this narrative review is to analyse the utility of abdominal ultrasonography in diagnosing fungal infections in children in terms of its positive hit rates and utility in typical use. Text words and indexed terms related to 'fungal infection and ultrasonography' and 'children' were searched on MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Scopus. Paediatric oncology patients, neonates and generally immunocompromised children were found to be at-risk groups with increasing susceptibility to risk factors for contracting fungal infections. Abdominal ultrasonography was found to aid in the diagnosis of fungal infection in many cases, but not all patients with the identified risk factors were diagnosed with fungal infections and not all patients diagnosed with fungal infections had identified risk factors. Ultrasonography was found to be overutilised and the current decision process in requesting abdominal ultrasonography in diagnosing fungal infection should be revised. Further study into an effective criterion in requesting abdominal ultrasonography is suggested to reduce the overutilisation of ultrasonography, thus reducing risk of infection and discomfort while also saving time and money.","In paediatric patients, ultrasonography is one of the preferred medical imaging modalities due to the lack of ionising radiation.

A major controversy surrounding CHC is whether this oral lesion owns malignant transformation (MT) potential. The aim of the present study was to evaluate current evidence on the MT of CHC and to determine the variables which have the greatest influence on cancer development. Bibliographical searches included PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and LILACS. The cohort studies and case series used to investigate the MT of CHC were deemed suitable for inclusion. The quality of the enrolled studies was measured by the Joanna Briggs Institute scale. Moreover, we undertook subgroup analyses, assessed small study effects, and conducted sensitivity analyses. From 338 studies, nine were finally included for qualitative/quantitative analysis. The overall MT rate for CHC across all studies was 12.1% (95% confidential interval, 4.1-19.8%). Subgroup analysis showed that the MT rate increased when pooled analysis was restricted to poor quality studies. It remains complex to affirm whether CHC is an individual and oral, potentially malignant disorder according to the retrieved evidence. Prospective cohort studies to define the natural history of CHC and a consensus statement to clarify a proper set of diagnostic criteria are strongly needed.

10.3390/jof10080512,A Countermeasure Strategy against Peramine Developed by <i>Chilesia rudis</i> in the Endophyte-Ryegrass-Herbivore Model.,"Exploitation of the symbiotic relationship between endophytic fungi and ryegrass is a crucial technique for reducing the incidence of insect pests. This is primarily due to the production of alkaloids, such as peramine, by the fungi. This alkaloid has been reported as both a deterrent and toxic to a variety of insects. However, insects have developed various strategies to counteract plant defenses. One of the most studied methods is their ability to sequester toxic compounds from plants. In this study, we examined the feeding preferences and adaptation to peramine in <i>Chilesia rudis</i>, a native Chilean larva. Using a no-choice assay, we assessed larval feeding preferences and mass gain on seven experimental lines and two commercial cultivars of endophyte-infected and non-infected ryegrass. Pupal development time and adult performance were evaluated post-assay. Additionally, we measured peramine content in larval carcasses, feces, and ryegrass leaves. Jumbo was the most preferred cultivar with 32 mm<sup>2</sup> of leaf tissues consumed. The longest pupal development time was observed in L161 and ALTO AR1, both at 28 days. Wing length in adults was greatest in the Jumbo and L163 cultivars, measuring 1.25 cm and 1.32 cm, respectively. Peramine concentrations were detected in the bodies of <i>C. rudis</i>. In conclusion, this larva can adapt to endophyte-infected ryegrass and develop counter-adaptation mechanisms to mitigate the effects of peramine.","Exploitation of the symbiotic relationship between endophytic fungi and ryegrass is a crucial technique for reducing the incidence of insect pests.

The black fungus is associated with the Mycolicibacterium smegmatis, Mucor lusitanicus, and Rhizomucor miehei microorganisms. At the same time, other pathogenic diseases, such as the Monkeypox virus and Marburg virus, impacted global health. Policymakers are concerned about these pathogens due to their severe pathogenic capabilities and rapid spread. However, no standard therapies are available to manage and treat those conditions. Since the coptisine has significant antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal properties; therefore, the current investigation has been designed by modifying coptisine to identify an effective drug molecule against Black fungus, Monkeypox, and Marburg virus. After designing the derivatives of coptisine, they have been optimized to get a stable molecular structure. These ligands were then subjected to molecular docking study against two vital proteins obtained from black fungal pathogens: Rhizomucor miehei (PDB ID: 4WTP) and Mycolicibacterium smegmatis (PDB ID 7D6X), and proteins found in Monkeypox virus (PDB ID: 4QWO) and Marburg virus (PDB ID 4OR8). Following molecular docking, other computational investigations, such as ADMET, QSAR, drug-likeness, quantum calculation and molecular dynamics, were also performed to determine their potentiality as antifungal and antiviral inhibitors. The docking score reported that they have strong affinities against Black fungus, Monkeypox virus, and Marburg virus. Then, the molecular dynamic simulation was conducted to determine their stability and durability in the physiological system with water at 100 ns, which documented that the mentioned drugs were stable over the simulated time. Thus, our <i>in silico</i> investigation provides a preliminary report that coptisine derivatives are safe and potentially effective against Black fungus, Monkeypox virus, and Marburg virus.

Wheat, as a staple crop in China, is particularly notable for its mycotoxin contamination. The main mycotoxins in wheat include deoxynivalenol (DON) and its derivates, zearalenone (ZEN) and aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>). After harvest, drying process is an effective technique and a necessary step to ensure the long-term safe storage of wheat. In this study, the moisture content, the concentrations of total fungi and main mycotoxins in post-harvest wheat of three wheat growing areas in the North China Plain were examined, and the effect of different drying methods on wheat quality was evaluated. The results showed that 87.5% of wheat samples were simultaneously contaminated with two or more mycotoxins. Due to the pre-harvest heavy rainfall, the moisture content, the levels of total fungi and mycotoxins in wheat samples of Liaocheng city were significantly higher compared to other regions. Moreover, the effects of different drying methods on the starch gelatinization and viscosity properties of wheat were investigated. The results showed that both natural air drying and dryer drying altered the crystal structure within starch particles and affected the gelatinization and viscosity properties of wheat starch.

It is also considered the most popular fresh juice in Egypt. The sugar content of the sugarcane stem represents the main source of fungal growth. This study aimed to investigate the natural co-occurrence of fungi in sugarcane plants and juice, test of aflatoxins production by aflatoxigenic fungi, and improve the quality of sugarcane juice. The obtained results indicated a notable decrease in all physical parameters of the naturally infected sugarcane plants. Isolation of fungi from sugarcane plant and juice from three localities revealed that the highest mean fungal count was recorded in sugarcane rootlets (173.55 cfu/cm), followed by sugarcane stem (94.88 cfu/cm), while sugarcane juice had the least mean fungal count (24.33 cfu/mL). The frequency of the isolated fungi associated with sugarcane plant yielded 781 fungal isolates for rootlets, 427 fungal isolates for stems, and 219 fungal isolates for juice.

It is also considered the most popular fresh juice in Egypt. The sugar content of the sugarcane stem represents the main source of fungal growth. This study aimed to investigate the natural co-occurrence of fungi in sugarcane plants and juice, test of aflatoxins production by aflatoxigenic fungi, and improve the quality of sugarcane juice. The obtained results indicated a notable decrease in all physical parameters of the naturally infected sugarcane plants. Isolation of fungi from sugarcane plant and juice from three localities revealed that the highest mean fungal count was recorded in sugarcane rootlets (173.55 cfu/cm), followed by sugarcane stem (94.88 cfu/cm), while sugarcane juice had the least mean fungal count (24.33 cfu/mL).

10.3390/cancers17091413,Assessing the Clinical Effectiveness of Radioimmunotherapy with Combined Radionuclide/Monoclonal Antibody Conjugates in Cancer Treatment: Insights from Randomised Clinical Trials.,"<b>Background:</b> Despite the development of advanced cancer therapies, achieving cancer eradication remains challenging. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is an innovative approach that combines radionuclides with monoclonal antibodies targeting tumour-associated antigens or those expressed by the tumour microenvironment. Over the past two decades, RIT has been extensively researched, along with two RIT products-<sup>90</sup>Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and <sup>131</sup>I-tositumomab. However, despite its demonstrated efficacy in non-solid tumours, RIT's clinical use remains limited, and its effectiveness in solid tumours is inconclusive. This study aimed to analyse randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the overall clinical effectiveness of RIT across different cancer types and its impact on treatment outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, CENTRAL, and Google Scholar was conducted from January 2000 to October 2024 in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and the PICOS framework. Studies were included if they were RCTs evaluating RIT for cancer treatment and reported treatment outcomes such as overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease-free survival, or time to progression (TTP). Data extraction was performed using a standardised Excel form, and study quality was assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for RCTs. A narrative synthesis of the data was complemented by meta-analyses where feasible, particularly for progression- and survival-related endpoints. <b>Results:</b> Out of 2241 records identified, 20 RCTs encompassing approximately 3562 patients were included. The majority of trials focused on non-solid tumours, particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), while a smaller subset evaluated solid tumours such as lung, pancreatic, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Most non-solid tumour studies employed <sup>90</sup>Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan or <sup>131</sup>I-tositumomab, targeting the CD20 antigen, whereas limited evidence exists for RIT efficacy in solid tumours. Meta-analysis of progression-related outcomes yielded a pooled hazard ratio (HR) of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39-0.59), indicating a 52% reduction in the risk of progression. In contrast, overall survival outcomes were more variable, with a pooled OS HR of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.60-1.07). Adverse events, predominantly haematological and nonhaematological toxicities, were common yet generally reversible. The findings suggest that RIT, especially when used as part of combination regimens, significantly improves treatment outcomes in non-solid tumours but has an inconsistent effect in solid tumour settings. <b>Conclusions:</b> The results underscore the clinical promise of RIT in treating non-solid tumours like NHL, where combination regimens yield superior outcomes compared to monotherapy. However, the inconclusive evidence in solid tumours highlights the need for further large-scale, well-designed RCTs to define the optimal use, dosing, and patient selection for RIT in these settings. Additionally, standardisation in outcome reporting and longer follow-up periods are essential for more accurate economic and clinical assessments. Overall, RIT represents a valuable therapeutic modality, yet its integration into cancer treatment regimens should be guided by further research aimed at mitigating toxicity and optimising combination strategies.","<b>Background:</b> Despite the development of advanced cancer therapies, achieving cancer eradication remains challenging.

We have observed a significant correlation between the number of aphids and the occurrence of SSR in our field studies. Electropenetrography (EPG) was used to evaluate the effects of <i>Brevicoryne brassicae</i> (Linnaeus) on two oilseed rape cultivars while acquiring, vectoring and inoculating of <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> Lib. (de Bary) ascospores. The results demonstrated that aphid feeding followed by the application of an ascospore suspension significantly increased <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> incidence. Aphids were capable of adhering to ascospores and carrying them to healthy plants, thereby causing diseases. The results of the EPG analysis indicated that aphid feeding behaviour was significantly altered in all leaf tissue levels following infection with <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>. Aphids initiated their first puncture significantly sooner than the control group, began probing mesophyll cells earlier, significantly increased the frequency of both short probes and intracellular punctures and had a significantly shorter pathway duration. On infected aphid-susceptible cultivars, aphids secreted more saliva but had reduced ingestion compared with aphids feeding on non-infected oilseed rape. In addition, ascospores can affect aphid feeding behaviour by adhering to aphids. Aphids carrying ascospores punctured cells earlier, with a significant increase in the frequency and duration of short probes and cell punctures, shortened pathway durations, increased salivation and reduced ingestion compared with aphids not carrying ascospores. On aphid-susceptible cultivars, aphids carrying ascospores delayed puncture onset, but on resistant cultivars, puncture onset was shortened. There is a correlation between aphids and <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>. The impact of <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> on aphid feeding behaviour is directional, favouring the spread of the fungus. This promotion does not appear to be altered by the aphid resistance of the cultivar.","The relation between aphids and Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) in oilseed rape is rarely examined because they are often studied alone.

10.1007/s12281-023-00456-2,The Impact of Corticosteroids on the Outcome of Fungal Disease: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"<h4>Purpose of review</h4>Corticosteroids have a complex relationship with fungal disease - risk for many, benefit for others. This systematic review aims to address the effect of corticosteroids on mortality and visual outcome in different fungal diseases.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Corticosteroids are a risk factor of aspergillosis for patients who have COVID-19, and they also led to a worse outcome. Similarity, corticosteroids are a risk factor for candidemia and mucormycosis. Some researchers reported that using topical corticosteroid in keratitis was associated with worse visual outcome if fungal keratitis. Some studies showed that corticosteroids are linked to a negative outcome for non-HIV patients with <i>Pneumocystis jirovecii</i> pneumonia (PCP), in contrast to those with HIV and PCP.<h4>Summary</h4>In 59 references, we found that corticosteroid therapy showed a worse clinical outcome in invasive aspergillosis (IA) (HR: 2.50, 95%CI: 1.89-3.31, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) (HR: 2.74, 95%CI: 1.48-5.06, <i>p</i> = 0.001), PCP without HIV infection (OR: 1.29, 95%CI: 1.09-1.53, <i>p</i> = 0.003), invasive candidiasis and candidaemia (OR: 2.13, 95%CI: 1.85-2.46, <i>p</i> < 0.001), mucormycosis (OR: 4.19, 95%CI: 1.74-10.05, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and early in the course of fungal keratitis (OR: 2.99, 95%CI: 1.14-7.84, <i>p</i> = 0.026). There was equivocal outcome in cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in AIDS and primary coccidioidomycosis, while corticosteroid therapy showed a better outcome in PCP in HIV-infected patients (RR: 0.62, 95%CI: 0.46-0.83, <i>p</i>=0.001) and fungal keratitis patients after keratoplasty surgery (OR: 0.01, 95%CI: 0.00-0.41, <i>p</i> = 0.041) and probably in cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in non-immunocompromised patients. A sub-analysis in invasive aspergillosis and CPA showed that use of more than 2 mg/kg/day of prednisolone equivalents per day is a significant factor in increasing mortality (HR: 2.94, 95%CI: 2.13-4.05, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Corticosteroid therapy during invasive fungal disease was usually associated with a slightly or greatly increased mortality or worse visual outcome (in fungal keratitis), with two disease exceptions. Avoiding the addition of corticosteroids, or minimising dose and duration in those who require them, is likely to improve the outcome of most life- and vision-threatening fungal diseases. This review provides a cornerstone for further research in exploring the accuracy of suitable dose and duration of corticosteroids treatment in fungal diseases.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12281-023-00456-2.","<h4>Purpose of review</h4>Corticosteroids have a complex relationship with fungal disease - risk for many, benefit for others.

In COVID-19 patients the severity of the disease depends on myriad factors but diabetes mellitus is the most important comorbidity. The current review was conducted to investigate the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and disease severity of COVID-19 in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and relevant treatment. The literature published in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was reviewed up to September 2021. The keywords including SARS-CoV-2, type 2 diabetes mellitus in COVID-19, hyperglycemia in COVID-19, opportunistic infections in type 2 diabetes mellitus and COVID-19 were used in different combinations. Hyperglycemic individuals over-express ACE-2 receptors in the lungs thus increasing the SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and replication. Although dipeptidyl peptidase-4 plays an important role in glucose homeostasis, additionally it also stimulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α creating a cytokine storm. Cytokine storm might be responsible for respiratory insufficiency in severe COVID-19 patients. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with immunosuppression and the patients are prone to get many opportunistic infections. Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with severe COVID-19 have lymphopenia. Moreover, in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients the neutrophils exhibit decreased chemotaxis, hydrogen peroxide production, and phagocytosis. Reduction in lymphocyte count and defective neutrophil capacity renders them with COVID-19 susceptible to opportunistic bacterial and fungal infections increasing the mortality rate. The opportunistic bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients were due to <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i> pneumonia, and coagulase-negative Staphylococci, <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Klebsiella</i> sp. In COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, mucormycosis was found to be the most common fungal infection with a higher predilection to males.

However, whether mycotic infection can be considered a risk factor for COVID-19 remains unknown. We searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases for studies published from inception to December 27, 2021. Pooled effect sizes were calculated according to a random-effects model or fixed-effect model, depending on heterogeneity. We also performed subgroup analyses to identify differences in mortality rates between continents and fungal species. A total of 20 articles were included in this study. Compared with the controls, patients with mycotic infection had an odds ratio (OR) of 2.69 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.22-3.26] for mortality and an OR of 2.28 (95% CI: 1.65-3.16) for renal replacement therapy (RRT).

This naturally occurring methoxyacrylate is one of the most often used fungicides in agriculture in male albino rats. Six sets of 60 mature male albino rats were randomly assigned: control (distilled water), Azoxystrobin formulation (AZOF), Azoxystrobin nano-formula (AZON), ZnNPs, AZOF + ZnNPs, and AZON + ZnNPs. Blood and tissues were obtained for further immunohistochemical, pathological, and biochemical examination. The results showed that exposure to AZOF and AZON significantly increased the levels of the oxidative stress indicators glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Additionally, AZOF significantly impacts liver function bioindicators, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. AZOF and AZON induced damage to the liver and kidney by disrupting vascular dilatation and causing hemorrhages, apoptosis, inflammatory lymphocytes, and necrosis. Furthermore, co-administration of ZnNPs with fungicides (AZOF and AZON) can gently enhance the alterations of oxidative stress and liver function bioindicators levels. These findings showed that ZnNPs could help male rats receiving AZ treat their histologically abnormal liver and kidney.","This study sought to ascertain if zinc nanoparticles (ZnNPs) could lessen the toxicity of azoxystrobin (AZ).

New pathogens are increasingly reported in the intensive care unit (ICU) population. We report a case of a patient who developed <i>Trichoderma</i> spp.-related pneumonia (TRP) after heart-lung transplantation. In the absence of antifungal susceptibility testing, TRP was confirmed by histological examination, and empirical therapy with voriconazole and caspofungin was swiftly initiated. Complete resolution of pneumonia was obtained after prolonged combination therapy. Given the lack of guidelines, we conducted a systematic review to elucidate the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to apply during <i>Trichoderma</i> infection.

New pathogens are increasingly reported in the intensive care unit (ICU) population. We report a case of a patient who developed <i>Trichoderma</i> spp.-related pneumonia (TRP) after heart-lung transplantation. In the absence of antifungal susceptibility testing, TRP was confirmed by histological examination, and empirical therapy with voriconazole and caspofungin was swiftly initiated.

10.1371/journal.pone.0293956,Investigation of nasal epithelial cells as a surrogate for bronchial epithelial cells in the research of equine asthma.,"Equine asthma, previously known as Recurrent Airway Obstruction (RAO) or Inflammatory Airway Disease (IAD), is an often-debilitating condition that may severely affect both performance and quality of life. Research is hindered by the low sample numbers of subjects recruited to studies, a consequence in part of the invasive nature of the sampling methods of bronchial brushing and biopsy. We present an alternative method of sampling equine airway epithelial cells, the 'nasal brush method' (NBM). Obtained by light brushing of the ventral meatus whilst the horse is under standing sedation, these cells express the same markers of differentiation as their deeper counterparts. Grown as 3-D spheroids or as air-liquid interface cultures, nasal epithelial cells are responsive to the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-13. This may be attenuated by modulation of the Notch signalling pathway using the gamma-secretase inhibitor Semagecestat; a previously unreported finding that cements the link between equine and human asthma research and strengthens the case for a One Health approach in researching asthma pathophysiology and therapeutic intervention.","Equine asthma, previously known as Recurrent Airway Obstruction (RAO) or Inflammatory Airway Disease (IAD), is an often-debilitating condition that may severely affect both performance and quality of life.

Current non-destructive detection methods face limited practical applications in grain quality detection. This study aims to understand the optical properties and volatileomics of <i>F. graminearum</i>-contaminated maize. Specifically, the transmission and reflection spectra (wavelength range of 200-1100 nm) were used to explore the optical properties of <i>F. graminearum</i>-contaminated maize. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of <i>F. graminearum</i>-contaminated maize were determined by headspace solid phase micro-extraction with gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The VOCs of normal maize were mainly alcohols and ketones, while the VOCs of severely contaminated maize became organic acids and alcohols. The ultraviolet excitation spectrum of maize showed a peak redshift as fungi grew, and the intensity decreased in the 400-600 nm band. Peak redshift and intensity changes were observed in the visible/near-infrared reflectance and transmission spectra of <i>F. graminearum</i>-contaminated maize. Remarkably, optical imaging platforms based on optical properties were developed to ensure high-throughput detection for single-kernel maize. The developed imaging platform could achieve more than 80% classification accuracy, whereas asymmetric polarization imaging achieved more than 93% prediction accuracy. Overall, these results can provide theoretical support for the cost-effective preparation of low-cost gas sensors and high-prediction sorting equipment for maize quality detection.","<i>Fusarium graminearum</i> (<i>F. graminearum</i>) in maize poses a threat to grain security.

Here, we propose high trunk truncation (HTT), the removal of the above 200 cm portion of trees, as a sustainable management strategy to control ALB. To examine the hypothesis, an initial step involved the assessment of various biological characteristics of ALB. Subsequently, a controlled field experiment was carried out utilizing HTT. Finally, HTT was applied in two additional ALB infestation regions. The results of the study of the biological characteristics of ALB showed that 76.31-78.88% of frass holes and 85.08-87.93% of emergence holes were located on branches above 200 cm. Adults preferred to feed on branches 2-3 cm in diameter, ALB eggs were predominantly laid on 5 cm branches, and both were primarily located above 200 cm. These results revealed a correlation between the number of ALBs and the tree crown height. The controlled field experiment showed that the number of ALBs was significantly decreased when the HTT strategy was implemented: approximately 90% of frass holes and 95% of adults were eradicated by HTT compared with the control. Different field surveys involving HTT have shown similar results. These findings provide valuable insights into a sustainable and efficient management strategy for reducing the number of ALBs.","The Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) causes substantial economic and ecological losses, thus, an environmentally friendly management strategy is needed.

Thus, the aim of the current study was to evaluate and compare the microbial growth in novel food patches at different dispersal periods by different populations of <i>Sitophilus oryzae</i> (e.g., internal-infesting) and <i>Lasioderma serricorne</i> (e.g., external-infesting). Adults of both species collected from laboratory colonies or field-captured populations were either placed immediately in a novel food patch, or given a dispersal period of 24 or 72 h in a sterilized environment before entering a surrogate food patch. Vectored microbes in new food patches were imaged after 3 or 5 days of foraging, and microbial growth was processed using ImageJ while fungal species were identified through sequencing the ITS4/5 ribosomal subunit. We found that increasing dispersal time resulted in multiple-fold reductions in microbial growth surrogate food patches by <i>L. serricorne</i> but not <i>S. oryzae</i>. This was likely attributable to higher mobility by <i>S. oryzae</i> than <i>L. serricorne</i>. A total of 20 morphospecies were identified from 13 genera among the 59 sequences, with a total of 23% and 16% classified as <i>Aspergillus</i> and <i>Penicillium</i> spp. Our data suggest that there is a persistent risk of microbial contamination by both species, which has important food safety implications at food facilities.","Understanding the ability of internal- and external-infesting stored product insects to vector microbes is important for estimating the relative risk that insects pose to postharvest commodities as they move between habitat patches and in the landscape.

The physiological condition of the targeted insect is crucial for its ability to withstand fungal infection. In particular, nutritional status is among the most important determinants of the insects' immune defense. In this study, we investigated the effects of diet on the development of the wireworm Agriotes obscurus (L.) (Coleoptera: Elateridae) and its subsequent susceptibility to the fungal pathogen Metarhizium brunneum (Petch) (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) in a pot experiment. After being reared on one of five plant diets for eight weeks, wireworms were exposed to an environment inoculated with the EPF and monitored for their susceptibility to fungal infection. We then performed a field experiment in which three plant diets (clover, radish, and a cover crop mix), selected according to the insects' performance in the laboratory experiment, were grown as a cover crop with EPF application. Plant diet influenced growth and development of larvae, but there were no strong differences in susceptibility toward fungal infection in the laboratory experiment. Damage levels in EPF-treated plots in the field varied depending on the cover crop. Damage was highest in plots planted with a mix of cover crop species, whereas damage was lowest in plots with clover or radish alone. This agrees with the laboratory results where insect performance was inferior when fed on clover or radish. Cover crop effects on wireworm damage in the subsequent cash crop may thus vary depending on the cover crop species selected.","Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) represent promising control agents against wireworms but success in field experiments is inconsistent.

In health, neutrophils undergo apoptosis and removal from the airway. Since CF neutrophils are known to engage in apoptosis less efficiently, we wanted to assess whether alternative forms of neutrophil clearance such as NETosis were prominent in the CF airway.<h4>Methods</h4>Sputum and blood were collected from 45 CF and 15 healthy control (HC) participants. Neutrophil morphology and biochemical properties were assessed in CF and HC sputum. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were measured by a novel histone-calprotectin ELISA. NET levels were compared with established measurements of airway inflammation. CF participants were followed up for 1 year and the number of exacerbations recorded. Neutrophil and macrophage co-culture experiments were undertaken with cells from CF and HC.<h4>Results</h4>Neutrophil numbers were significantly higher in CF and associated with abnormal morphology. Several inflammatory mediators were elevated in CF sputum, as was cell-free DNA. This was highly correlated with sputum calprotectin, a known NET-associated protein. Using a histone-calprotectin NET ELISA, we demonstrated higher levels of NETs in the CF airway. CF participants treated with DNase had fewer sputum NETs, and in neutrophil/macrophage co-culture experiments, DNase effectively attenuated the pro-inflammatory potential of NETs, suggesting a previously unrecognised anti-inflammatory role for this treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>NETs in the CF airway are associated with increased levels of inflammatory mediators and more severe lung disease. NET effects on macrophages can be blocked by DNase, suggesting an anti-inflammatory role for this treatment in CF.","<h4>Background</h4>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterised by inflammatory lung disease and large numbers of airways neutrophils.

10.1002/jlb.4a1221-743r,Notch regulates Histoplasma capsulatum clearance in mouse lungs during innate and adaptive immune response phases in primary infection.,"The clearance of the pathogenic fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum, requires cooperation between innate and adaptive immunity. Since this organism is inhaled, lung macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) are the first lines of defense. Moreover, DCs act as APCs to drive the education of type 1 Th cells to produce IFNγ, which contributes to the final elimination of H. capsulatum. In this study, we explored the importance of Notch signaling in host defenses using a mouse model of pulmonary histoplasmosis. We found up-regulation of Notch ligands (NLs) and Notch receptors (NRs) on phagocytes and IFNγ<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells upon infection in lungs and lymph nodes. To ascertain the influence of Notch on the course of infection, we used a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI), LY-411,575, which inhibits NR downstream signaling. This compound impaired fungal clearance when given at the time of infection or 7 days after infection. However, GSI did not impact fungal clearance in mice with preexisting immunity. The dampened host defenses were associated with reduced differentiation and maturation of monocyte-derived DCs and elevatmonocyte-derived macrophage and alveolar macrophage polarization to M2. Our study reveals the critical nature of Notch signaling in maintaining control of this infectious agent.","The clearance of the pathogenic fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum, requires cooperation between innate and adaptive immunity.

The mechanisms of how this fungal pathogen adapts to the mammalian host are poorly understood. Here we report the rapid evolution of an adaptive C. auris multicellular aggregative morphology in the murine host during systemic infection. C. auris aggregative cells accumulate in the brain and exhibit obvious advantages over the single-celled yeast-form cells during systemic infection. Genetic mutations, specifically de novo point mutations in genes associated with cell division or budding processes, underlie the rapid evolution of this aggregative phenotype. Most mutated C. auris genes are associated with the regulation of cell wall integrity, cytokinesis, cytoskeletal properties, and cellular polarization. Moreover, the multicellular aggregates are notably more recalcitrant to the host antimicrobial peptides LL-37 and PACAP relative to the single-celled yeast-form cells. Overall, to survive in the host, C. auris can rapidly evolve a multicellular aggregative morphology via genetic mutations.","Candida auris has become a serious threat to public health.

However, inconsistent standardized analytical methods raise concerns over product authenticity, mislabeling, and quality control. This study employs a multi-analytical approach to differentiate wildcrafted chaga canker from North American chaga dietary supplements, particularly those containing mycelia fermented grain products. High-Performance Thin-Layer Chromatography (HPTLC), Liquid Chromatography with Evaporative Light Scattering Detection (LC-ELSD) or Photo/Diode Array Detection (LC-PDA/DAD), Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (LC-QToF-MS), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and iodine-starch assays were used to evaluate key markers, including triterpenoids, polysaccharides, and melanin. Whole chaga canker contained triterpenoids (inotodiol, trametenolic acid) and phenolics, like osmundacetone, while melanin absorbance at 500 nm differentiated it from fermented grain products. β-Glucan quantification and iodine-starch assays confirmed starch-rich composition in fermented grains and its absence in authentic chaga canker. NMR fingerprinting and LC-QToF-MS metabolomics demonstrated stark compositional deviations between wildcrafted chaga canker, <i>I. obliquus</i> mycelium, and fermented grain products. By integrating complementary techniques, we establish a framework that can reliably distinguish genuine chaga canker from misrepresented products, ensuring consumer safety and fostering trust in the functional mushroom, canker, and mycelium markets.","Chaga (<i>Inonotus obliquus</i>) is an increasingly used natural product in botanical dietary supplements, valued for its bioactive compounds.

Thus, developing alternative antifungals that prevent drug resistance and induce immunity to eliminate Candida biofilms is crucial. Herein, a novel membrane-targeted aggregation-induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer (PS), TBTCP-QY, is developed for highly efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) of candidiasis. TBTCP-QY has a high molar absorption coefficient and an excellent ability to generate <sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> and •OH, entering the interior of biofilms due to its high permeability. Furthermore, TBTCP-QY can efficiently inhibit biofilm formation by suppressing the expression of genes related to the adhesion (ALS3, EAP1, and HWP1), invasion (SAP1 and SAP2), and drug resistance (MDR1) of C. albicans, which is also advantageous for eliminating potential fungal resistance to treat clinical infectious diseases. TBTCP-QY-mediated PDT efficiently targets OC and VVC in vivo in a mouse model, induces immune response, relieves inflammation, and accelerates the healing of mucosal defects to combat infections caused by clinically isolated fluconazole-resistant strains. Moreover, TBTCP-QY demonstrates excellent biocompatibility, suggesting its potential applications in the clinical treatment of OC and VVC.","Candida albicans (C. albicans), a ubiquitous polymorphic fungus in humans, causes different types of candidiasis, including oral candidiasis (OC) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), which are physically and mentally concerning and financially costly.

Timely diagnosis and treatment greatly enhance patient outcomes. This study aimed to explore the association between patient age and the development of IA, as well as the potential implications for risk stratification strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases for publications until October 2023 containing age characteristics of patients with and without IA. A random-effects model with the application of inverse-variance weighting was used to pool reported estimates from each study, and meta-regression and subgroup analyses were utilized to assess sources of heterogeneity.<h4>Results</h4>A systematic review was conducted, resulting in the inclusion of 55 retrospective observational studies with a total of 13,983 patients. Meta-analysis revealed that, on average, patients with IA were approximately two and a half years older (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.84-3.31 years; I<sup>2</sup> = 26.1%) than those without the disease (p < 0.0001). No significant moderators could explain the observed heterogeneity in age difference. However, subgroup analysis revealed that age differences were more pronounced within particular patient groups compared to others. For example, patients with and without IA who had primary severe lung infections exhibited a greater difference in mean age than other patient cohorts.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Further research, such as individual patient data meta-analysis, is necessary to better understand the potential relationship between increasing age and the likelihood of IA. Improved risk stratification strategies based on patient age could potentially enhance the early detection and treatment of IA, ultimately improving patient outcomes.","<h4>Background</h4>Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) is a life-threatening fungal disease with significant mortality rates.

While previous research has extensively characterized cell wall-derived molecules during fungal infection, the role of plasma membrane-derived ones remains unclear. Here, we reveal the discovery of inositol phosphate glycans (IPGs) released during infection, originating from plant sphingolipids, specifically glycosylinositol phosphorylceramides (GIPC). Advanced chromatography, mass spectrometry techniques and molecular biology were employed to identify these IPGs, and determine their origins. In addition to the well-characterized role of B. cinerea in releasing cell wall-degrading enzymes, this research suggests that B. cinerea's enzymatic machinery may also target the degradation of the plant plasma membrane. As a consequence of this, IPGs identical to those generated by the host plant are released, most likely due to activity of a putative phospholipase C that acts on GIPC plasma membrane lipids. These insights could pave the way for developing new strategies to enhance crop resistance by focusing on membrane integrity in addition to cell wall fortification.","This study investigates the presence and significance of phosphorylated oligosaccharides that accumulate during the interaction between Arabidopsis thaliana and Botrytis cinerea, a necrotrophic fungus that poses a major threat to crops worldwide.

Twelve of the 13 patients are from endemic areas, and nine of the 12 cases are from emerging endemic areas, India and China. Three patients had sojourn history may related to the disease onset. Twelve of the 13 cases fulfilled HLH-2004 criteria. The diagnosis of <i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i> infection was established by histological examination (13 of 13), culture (4 of 13), molecular method (2 of 13), and antigen or serological assays (2 of 13). Amphotericin B, posaconazole, and itraconazole show favorable activity against the fungus, seven patients used specific treatment for HLH. For analysis of outcomes, two of the 13 patients died. Our present case report and literature review show that disseminated <i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i> infection with HLH in the immunocompetent population becomes increasingly common in emerging endemic areas and have high mortality. It is necessary for clinicians to improve the awareness of disease diagnosis due to the atypical population and disease presentation. Timely diagnosis and early use of antifungal agents will lead to favorable prognosis.",EuropePMC
,<i>Candida</i> species colonization in oral lichen planus: A meta-analysis.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a common chronic inflammatory disease that affects 1%-2% of the population. <i>Candida</i> species superinfection can aggravate the symptoms of OLP, especially of the erosive forms, and promote malignant transformation by producing carcinogenics as nitrosamines or acetaldehyde. On the other hand, antifungal treatment of <i>Candida</i>-infected OLPs improves the clinical symptoms of the disease. The objective of this study is to assess the possible influence of <i>Candida</i> species colonization in oral lichen planus.<h4>Methods</h4>A search for studies on <i>Candida</i> and oral lichen planus was performed in the following databases: PubMed (MEDLINE, Cochrane Library), Web of Science (WoS), and Scopus. Data analysis: The estimated prevalence of <i>Candida</i> detection in OLP was calculated according to the DerSimonian and Laird random model. For dichotomous outcomes, the estimates of effects of an intervention were expressed as odds ratio (OR) using Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) method with 95% confidence intervals.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-four studies were included in this meta-analysis. The estimated prevalence of <i>Candida</i> species detection in oral lichen planus (OLP) lesions was 37.00% (95% CI: 30.52-43.72%). OLP patients were almost 2½ times more likely to be infected by <i>Candida</i> species compared to healthy controls (OR: 2.48, <i>P</i> < 0.001).

Information about this life stage could have significant conservation implications for both imperiled and invasive lampreys. We investigated tag retention, survival, wound healing, and swim performance of newly transformed sea lamprey (<i>Petromyzon marinus</i>) implanted with a new micro-acoustic transmitter, the eel-lamprey acoustic transmitter (ELAT), in a controlled laboratory environment.<h4>Results</h4>The 61-day survival of our tagged subjects was 71%, within the range reported in similar studies of juvenile lampreys. However, survival was significantly lower in the tagged animals (vs control), with no effect statistically attributable to measures of animal length, mass, condition, or population of origin (Great Lakes vs. Atlantic drainage). Mortality in tagged fish was concentrated in the first four days post-surgery, suggesting injury from the surgical process. An unusually long recovery time from anesthesia may have contributed to the increased mortality. In a simple burst swim assay, tagged animals swam significantly slower (- 22.5%) than untagged animals, but were not significantly different in endurance swim tests. A composite wound healing score at day four was a significant predictor of maximum burst swim speed at day 20, and wound condition was related to animal mass, but not length, at the time of tagging.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Impairments to survival and swim performance of juvenile sea lamprey implanted with the ELAT transmitter were within currently reported ranges for telemetry studies with small, difficult to observe fishes. Our results could be improved with more refined anesthesia and surgical techniques. The ability to track migratory movements of imperiled and pest populations of parasitic lampreys will improve our ability to estimate vital rates that underlie recruitment to the adult population (growth, survival) and to investigate the environmental factors that regulate the timing and rates of movement, in wild populations.","<h4>Background</h4>Little is known about the transformer stage of the parasitic lampreys, a brief but critical period that encompasses juvenile out-migration from rivers to lakes or oceans to begin parasitic feeding.

The World Health Organization has responded to the rising threat of traditionally neglected fungal infections by developing a Fungal Priority Pathogens List (FPPL). Taking the highest-ranked fungal pathogen in the FPPL, Cryptococcus neoformans, as a paradigm, we review progress made over the past two decades on its global burden, its clinical manifestation and management of cryptococcal infection, and its antifungal resistance. The purpose of this review is to drive research efforts to improve future diagnoses, therapies, and interventions associated with fungal infections.<h4>Methods</h4>We first reviewed trends in the global burden of HIV-associated cryptococcal infection, mainly based on a series of systematic studies. We next conducted scoping reviews in accordance with the guidelines described in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews using PubMed and ScienceDirect with the keyword Cryptococcus neoformans to identify case reports of cryptococcal infections published since 2000. We then reviewed recent updates on the diagnosis and antifungal treatment of cryptococcal infections. Finally, we summarized knowledge regarding the resistance and tolerance of C. neoformans to approved antifungal drugs.<h4>Results</h4>There has been a general reduction in the estimated global burden of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis since 2009, probably due to improvements in highly active antiretroviral therapies. However, cryptococcal meningitis still accounts for 19% of AIDS-related deaths annually. The incidences of CM in Europe and North America and the Latin America region have increased by approximately two-fold since 2009, while other regions showed either reduced or stable numbers of cases. Unfortunately, diagnostic and treatment options for cryptococcal infections are limited, and emerging antifungal resistance exacerbates the public health burden.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The rising threat of C. neoformans is compounded by accumulating evidence for its ability to infect immunocompetent individuals and the emergence of antifungal-resistant variants. Emphasis should be placed on further understanding the mechanisms of pathogenicity and of antifungal resistance and tolerance. The development of novel management strategies through the identification of new drug targets and the discovery and optimization of new and existing diagnostics and therapeutics are key to reducing the health burden.","<h4>Background</h4>Emerging fungal pathogens pose important threats to global public health.

The use of varying steroid doses has resulted in inconsistent outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively identified patients diagnosed with ICI-M at our institution between January 2020 and February 2024. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive literature review using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to facilitate a comparative analysis of clinical responses. The primary aim was to compare clinical outcomes and therapeutic responses between patients treated with high-dose versus low-dose methylprednisolone.<h4>Results</h4>Patients receiving an initial high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day) exhibited a more rapid reduction in myocardial injury markers, including troponin I/T (cTnI/T), creatine kinase (CK), and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), compared to those receiving lower doses. This group also demonstrated lower incidences of biomarker rebound and maintained lower levels over time. Additionally, the clinical treatment process was more straightforward in the high-dose group, with treatment efficacy surpassing that observed in patients who received an initial methylprednisolone (mPSL) dose of less than 1 g/day. Regarding prognosis, the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and cardiovascular mortality was significantly lower in the high-dose group compared to the low-dose group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated myocarditis, the prompt administration of high-dose corticosteroid pulse therapy (1 g/day) is strongly associated with improved clinical outcomes. This intervention rapidly lowers myocardial injury biomarkers (cTnI/T, CK, NT-proBNP) while minimizing the risk of biomarker rebound, thus optimizing clinical management. Notably, it significantly reduces the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), thereby enhancing patient prognosis. The duration of therapy should be tailored based on clinical response. In cases of steroid resistance, combination therapies may provide additional benefit.","<h4>Background</h4>Immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated myocarditis (ICI-M) is a rare yet potentially fatal complication of immunotherapy, with no standardized treatment protocol due to limited data.

10.4269/ajtmh.20-1105,Pragmatic Recommendations for the Management of COVID-19 Patients with Shock in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.,"As some patients infected with the novel coronavirus progress to critical illness, a subset will eventually develop shock. High-quality data on management of these patients are scarce, and further investigation will provide valuable information in the context of the pandemic. A group of experts identify a set of pragmatic recommendations for the care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and shock in resource-limited environments. We define shock as life-threatening circulatory failure that results in inadequate tissue perfusion and cellular dysoxia/hypoxia, and suggest that it can be operationalized via clinical observations. We suggest a thorough evaluation for other potential causes of shock and suggest against indiscriminate testing for coinfections. We suggest the use of the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) as a simple bedside prognostic score for COVID-19 patients and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to evaluate the etiology of shock. Regarding fluid therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with shock in low-middle-income countries, we favor balanced crystalloids and recommend using a conservative fluid strategy for resuscitation. Where available and not prohibited by cost, we recommend using norepinephrine, given its safety profile. We favor avoiding the routine use of central venous or arterial catheters, where availability and costs are strong considerations. We also recommend using low-dose corticosteroids in patients with refractory shock. In addressing targets of resuscitation, we recommend the use of simple bedside parameters such as capillary refill time and suggest that POCUS be used to assess the need for further fluid resuscitation, if available.","As some patients infected with the novel coronavirus progress to critical illness, a subset will eventually develop shock.

With the resurgence of blight resistant American Chestnut plantings both for commercial production and for habitat restoration, <i>C. sayi</i> has become a similarly resurgence pest. Here, we investigated the nature and extent of <i>C. sayi</i> larval damage on individual nuts and collected harvests with an eye toward the quantifying impacts. Next, we explored management options using biological control including entomopathogenic fungi and entomopathogenic nematodes. Nut damage from <i>C. sayi</i> can be extensive with individual nuts hosting several larvae, larvae emerging from nuts several weeks post harvest, and nut weight loss even after <i>C. sayi</i> have emerged from the nut. Applications of entomopathogenic fungi reduced chances of chestnut infestation, while certain strains of entomopathogenic nematodes increased the probability of <i>C. sayi</i> larval mortality. Understanding <i>C. sayi</i> damage and exploring biological control management options could be a useful tool in the effective management of this resurgent pest.","The lesser chestnut weevil, <i>Curculio sayi</i> (Gyllenhal), can cause irreparable damage to chestnuts through direct consumption and/or introduction of secondary pathogens.

10.1186/s12983-024-00537-z,Paternal care plasticity: males care more for early- than late-developing embryos in an arboreal breeding treefrog.,"<h4>Background</h4>Parental care benefits offspring but comes with costs. To optimize the trade-off of costs and benefits, parents should adjust care based on intrinsic and/or extrinsic conditions. The harm to offspring hypothesis suggests that parents should invest more in younger offspring than older offspring because younger offspring are more vulnerable. However, this hypothesis has rarely been comprehensively tested, as many studies only reveal an inverse correlation between parental care and offspring age, without directly testing the effects of offspring age on their vulnerability. To test this hypothesis, we studied Kurixalus eiffingeri, an arboreal treefrog with paternal care. We first performed a field survey by monitoring paternal care during embryonic development. Subsequently, we conducted a field experiment to assess the prevalence of egg predators (a semi-slug, Parmarion martensi) and the plasticity of male care. Finally, we conducted a laboratory experiment to assess how embryo age affects predation by P. martensi.<h4>Results</h4>Our results showed that (1) male attendance and brooding frequency affected embryo survival, and (2) males attended and brooded eggs more frequently in the early stage than in the late stage. The experimental results showed that (3) males increased attendance frequency when the predators were present, and (4) the embryonic predation by the semi-slug during the early was significantly higher than in the late stage.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings highlight the importance of paternal care to embryo survival, and the care behavior is plastic. Moreover, our results provide evidence consistent with the predictions of the harm to offspring hypothesis, as males tend to care more for younger offspring which are more vulnerable.","<h4>Background</h4>Parental care benefits offspring but comes with costs.

10.1155/2021/3736108,Imaging Characteristics of Invasive Pulmonary Fungal Infection Secondary to Hematological Diseases and Comparison before and after Treatment.,"Fungal infections have become crucial factors that threaten the prognosis and survival of blood disease patients. Here, we aim to analyze the epidemiological characteristics and early and advanced CT (computed tomography) manifestations of patients with invasive pulmonary fungal infections secondary to blood system diseases. 65 hospitalized patients from October 2018 to October 2020 with invasive pulmonary fungal infections secondary to blood diseases were enrolled. Blood diseases were recorded according to clinical and imaging data, and the serum galactomannan test (GM test) was conducted. Two senior radiologists analyzed the CT data and recorded the distribution of the lesions and CT signs. We analyzed and counted the first chest CT scan images of patients with nodule/mass type secondary to hematological diseases and invasive pulmonary fungal infection. The first CT nodules or mass-type lesions were statistically significant in nodule size, the number of lesions, distribution, and accompanying signs. Pulmonary fungal infection was common in both lungs during 7-day, 14-day, and 30-day follow-up CT. We also found that the nodular mass type was the main manifestation in the positive group of the GM test. Both the positive group and the negative group had the highest incidence of nodules. The incidence of air crescent signs in nodules or mass lesions in the positive group was higher than in the negative group, and the difference was statistically significant. To conclude, follow-up CT signs after antifungal treatment were highly sensitive to the early diagnosis of hematological diseases and secondary invasive pulmonary Eumycetes infection, which could be used for clinical treatment to provide help. GM test results were also related to CT manifestations such as air crescent sign, cavity, and halo sign.","Fungal infections have become crucial factors that threaten the prognosis and survival of blood disease patients.

Research suggests that approximately 45% of patients with erythematous and ulcerative OLP may experience dry mouth sensations. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the current literature regarding the potential relationship or co-occurrence of xerostomia with OLP. Understanding this association is imperative for the development of comprehensive management strategies and the improvement of patient outcomes.<h4>Method and material</h4>The study followed the PRISMA 2020 checklist and included human studies, specifically investigating xerostomia in patients with OLP. After screening 897 articles, 9 studies were selected based on predefined criteria Quality assessment was conducted using the Cochrane risk of bias tools: ROB 2 for RCTs and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies Scale was conducted to evaluate potential biases in study design, selection, and outcomes.<h4>Result</h4>A systematic review of nine studies (1960-2023) examining xerostomia in OLP patients found a significant reduction in unstimulated salivary flow rates in many cases. Although evidence links xerostomia with OLP, a definitive causal relationship remains unestablished. Some studies highlighted Candida infection, altered saliva protein expression, and inflammation-related nerve damage as contributing factors to dry mouth in OLP patients.<h4>Discussion and conclusion</h4>This systematic review examines the potential relationship between OLP and xerostomia, focusing on factors such as salivary flow, histopathological changes, and immune-related mechanisms. While some studies suggest a link between OLP and reduced saliva production, no definitive causal relationship has been established. The review identified significant research gaps, including inconsistent methodologies and a lack of standardized criteria. Future studies should explore different OLP forms, receptor interactions, immune responses, and neuropeptides to gain a better understanding of xerostomia's etiopathogenesis and improve management strategies for OLP patients.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic disorder affecting the oral mucosa, potentially associated with xerostomia, either independently or concurrently.

10.3389/froh.2022.958480,Antimicrobial peptides: Defending the mucosal epithelial barrier.,"The recent epidemic caused by aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 virus illustrates the importance and vulnerability of the mucosal epithelial barrier against infection. Antimicrobial proteins and peptides (AMPs) are key to the epithelial barrier, providing immunity against microbes. In primitive life forms, AMPs protect the integument and the gut against pathogenic microbes. AMPs have also evolved in humans and other mammals to enhance newer, complex innate and adaptive immunity to favor the persistence of commensals over pathogenic microbes. The canonical AMPs are helictical peptides that form lethal pores in microbial membranes. In higher life forms, this type of AMP is exemplified by the defensin family of AMPs. In epithelial tissues, defensins, and calprotectin (complex of S100A8 and S100A9) have evolved to work cooperatively. The mechanisms of action differ. Unlike defensins, calprotectin sequesters essential trace metals from microbes, which inhibits growth. This review focuses on defensins and calprotectin as AMPs that appear to work cooperatively to fortify the epithelial barrier against infection. The antimicrobial spectrum is broad with overlap between the two AMPs. In mice, experimental models highlight the contribution of both AMPs to candidiasis as a fungal infection and periodontitis resulting from bacterial dysbiosis. These AMPs appear to contribute to innate immunity in humans, protecting the commensal microflora and restricting the emergence of pathobionts and pathogens. A striking example in human innate immunity is that elevated serum calprotectin protects against neonatal sepsis. Calprotectin is also remarkable because of functional differences when localized in epithelial and neutrophil cytoplasm or released into the extracellular environment. In the cytoplasm, calprotectin appears to protect against invasive pathogens. Extracellularly, calprotectin can engage pathogen-recognition receptors to activate innate immune and proinflammatory mechanisms. In inflamed epithelial and other tissue spaces, calprotectin, DNA, and histones are released from degranulated neutrophils to form insoluble antimicrobial barriers termed neutrophil extracellular traps. Hence, calprotectin and other AMPs use several strategies to provide microbial control and stimulate innate immunity.","The recent epidemic caused by aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 virus illustrates the importance and vulnerability of the mucosal epithelial barrier against infection.

Next, fresh maize was moldy by contaminated with strains MA and MB. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during the contamination process of two fungal strains were analyzed by gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS). A total of 31 VOCs were detected in maize contaminated with strain MA, a total of 32 VOCs were detected in maize contaminated with strain MB, including confirmed monomers and dimers. Finally, heat maps and principal component analysis (PCA) showed that VOCs produced in different growth stages of <i>Aspergillus</i> had great differences.

Detecting resilience-enhancing mechanisms is especially relevant in coastal ecosystems, where multi-stressor interactions can drive degradation over time. Here, we quantify the resilience-conferring potential of endobenthic sandprawns against eutrophication, including under high temperatures. We show using a global change mesocosm experiment that sandprawn presence was associated with declines in phytoplankton biomass, particularly under eutrophic conditions, where sandprawns reduced phytoplankton biomass by approximately 74% and prevented a shift to extreme eutrophy. Eutrophic waters were nanophytoplankton-dominated, but sandprawn presence countered this, resulting in even contributions of pico- and nanophytoplankton. Our findings highlight the potential for sandprawns to increase resilience against eutrophication by limiting phytoplankton blooms, preventing extreme eutrophy and counteracting nanophytoplankton dominance. Incorporating endobenthic crustaceans into resilience-based management practices can assist in arresting future water quality declines in coastal ecosystems.","Identifying processes that confer resilience against global change is a scientific challenge but is central to managing ecosystem functionality in future.

There are several therapy options available for onychomycosis, such as oral antifungals, topicals, and physical treatments. Terbinafine is in the frontline for the treatment of onychomycosis; however, several adverse effects are associated to its oral administration. In this work, innovative keratin-based carriers encapsulating terbinafine were designed to overcome the drawbacks related to the use this drug. Therapeutic textiles functionalized with keratin-based particles (100% keratin; 80% keratin/20% keratin-PEG) encapsulating terbinafine were developed. The controlled release of terbinafine from the functionalized textiles was evaluated against different mimetic biologic solutions (PBS buffer-pH = 7.4, micellar solution and acidic sweat solution-pH = 4.3). The modification of keratin with polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties favored the release of terbinafine at the end of 48 h for all the solution conditions. When the activity of functionalized textiles was tested against <i>Trichophyton rubrum</i>, a differentiated inhibition was observed. Textiles functionalized with 80% keratin/20% keratin-PEG encapsulating terbinafine showed a 2-fold inhibition halo compared with the textiles containing 100% keratin-encapsulating terbinafine.

No activity was observed for the textiles functionalized with keratin-based particles without terbinafine. The systems herein developed revealed therapeutic potential towards nail fungal infections, taking advantage of keratin-based particles affinity to keratin structures and of the keratinase activity of <i>T. rubrum.</i>",EuropePMC

Here, we used RNAseq and bioinformatics to reveal mating-induced changes of genes and pathways related to reproduction and survival in female <i>Cephalcia chuxiongica</i>, a pine defoliator with facultative parthenogenesis and long larval dormancy. Results showed that mating induced substantial downregulation on genes and pathways associated to immunity, stress response, and longevity. However, mating induced divergent reproductive response, with downregulation on genes and pathways related to egg production while upregulation on genes and pathways related to egg fertilization. Considering the nature of limited resources in adults, low fecundity, and egg protection behavior in <i>C. chuxiongica</i>, we suggest that mating triggers trade-offs between reproduction and survival in this insect and females of this species may have evolved specific strategies to adapt to the environmental and hosts' conditions, e.g., restrict whole fecundity to ensure higher fertilization and offspring's survival. Moreover, mating induced significant responses on genes and pathways that play important roles in vertebrate reproduction while their function in insects are unclear, such as the progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathway; the significant regulation after mating suggests that their function may be evolutionarily conserved in animal kingdom.","Investigation of mating-induced trade-offs between reproduction and survival is conducive to provide evolutionary insights into reproductive strategies and aging.

Demand for cassava in the food and fuel industry is growing worldwide. However, anthracnose disease caused by <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i> severely affects cassava yield and production. The bioactive molecules from <i>Bacillus</i> are widely used to control fungal diseases in several plants. Therefore, in this study, bioactive compounds (erucamide, behenic acid, palmitic acid, phenylacetic acid, and β-sitosterol) from <i>Bacillus megaterium</i> were assessed against CDC42, a key protein for virulence, from <i>C. gloeosporioides</i>. Structure of the CDC42 protein was generated through the comparative homology modeling method. The binding site of the ligands and the stability of the complex were analyzed through docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies, respectively. Furthermore, a protein interaction network was envisaged through the STRING database, followed by enrichment analysis in the WebGestalt tool. From the enrichment analysis, it is apparent that bioactive from <i>B. megaterium</i> chiefly targets the MAP kinase pathway that is essential for filamentous growth and virulence.

10.3390/dj11100239,Efficacy/Safety of the Use of Glucocorticoids in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Glucocorticoids, also known as corticosteroids or steroids, are drugs derived from cholesterol. They are synthesized by the adrenal cortex, along with other hormones, such as cortisol and aldosterone. Glucocorticoids are drugs recommended for patients undergoing surgery on the oral cavity, facial skeleton, and related cervical structures due to their high efficacy against inflammatory and immune processes. However, these drugs are restricted due to their multiple and serious adverse effects. The objective of this study was to verify the efficacy of corticosteroids administered in major surgeries of the oral cavity, as well as of the cervical and facial structures, based on the characteristics of the patient so as to select the best therapeutic strategy.<h4>Methods</h4>Articles in the databases of PubMed, Nature Portfolio, Medline, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were thoroughly examined.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 54 articles were selected to address the proposed objectives. The results obtained show that it is effective and safe to use glucocorticoids as pre- or postsurgical therapy in oral and maxillofacial surgery to control the processes of inflammation, pain, lockjaw, and edema. However, when referring to the use of these drugs, one must proceed with caution and pay particular attention when handling them. The concentration of the glucocorticoids used must be individualized, as well as the selection of the route of administration. Various studies show that, although the oral route is the most used route, the most effective route is the intramuscular route due to its easy absorption. However, for patients who have recurrent inflammatory and vesiculobullous ulcerative lesions, the topical route should be chosen to mitigate side effects, considering that recurrent applications must be made to prevent the worsening of the lesion and to avoid having to use medications enterally. In patients with cervicofacial infections, antibiotics continue to be the main drugs used to manage the condition in conjunction with corticosteroids. It is important to know the possible interactions of glucocorticoids with other medicines or food: it has been described that the interaction between Ritonavir, an antiretroviral drug that inhibits human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) proteases, and prednisone causes an increase in the concentration of prednisone, leading to possible toxicity in normally safe doses and, in many cases, iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome. It is also important to know the systemic or topical adverse effects of the chronic or high-dose use of glucocorticoids.<h4>Conclusions</h4>It can be concluded that by making adequate use of glucocorticoid therapy in oral and maxillofacial surgery to manage clinical manifestations, it is possible to attenuate the morbidities of treatment and intervention.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Glucocorticoids, also known as corticosteroids or steroids, are drugs derived from cholesterol.

Also, little is known about their tolerance to salinity and how it influences their activities. Extracellular enzymatic activities (EEAs) are widely used to determine heterotrophic microbes' enzymatic capabilities and substrate preferences. Five marine fungal species belonging to the most abundant pelagic phyla (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) were grown under non-saline and saline conditions (0 g/L and 35 g/L, respectively). Due to their sensitivity and specificity, fluorogenic substrate analogues were used to determine hydrolytic activity on carbohydrates (<i>β</i>-glucosidase, <i>β</i>-xylosidase, and <i>N</i>-acetyl-<i>β</i>-D-glucosaminidase); peptides (leucine aminopeptidase and trypsin); lipids (lipase); organic phosphorus (alkaline phosphatase), and sulfur compounds (sulfatase). Afterwards, kinetic parameters such as maximum velocity (V<sub>max</sub>) and half-saturation constant (K<sub>m</sub>) were calculated. All fungal species investigated cleaved these substrates, but some species were more efficient than others. Moreover, most enzymatic activities were reduced in the saline medium, with some exceptions like sulfatase. In non-saline conditions, the average V<sub>max</sub> ranged between 208.5 to 0.02 μmol/g biomass/h, and in saline conditions, 88.4 to 0.02 μmol/g biomass/h. The average K<sub>m</sub> ranged between 1553.2 and 0.02 μM with no clear influence of salinity. Taken together, our results highlight a potential tolerance of marine fungi to freshwater conditions and indicate that changes in salinity (due to freshwater input or evaporation) might impact their enzymatic activities spectrum and, therefore, their contribution to the oceanic elemental cycles.","Even though fungi are ubiquitous in the biosphere, the ecological knowledge of marine fungi remains rather rudimentary.

ABPM is considered in those with an ABPA-like presentation but normal <i>A. fumigatus</i>-IgE. Additionally, diagnosing ABPM requires repeated growth of the causative fungus from sputum. We do not routinely recommend treating asymptomatic ABPA patients. We recommend oral prednisolone or itraconazole monotherapy for treating acute ABPA (newly diagnosed or exacerbation), with prednisolone and itraconazole combination only for treating recurrent ABPA exacerbations.

The purpose of this review is to analyse the difference in terms of eradication rates and functional outcome after single- and double-stage prosthetic exchange for chronic periprosthetic joint infection around the knee.We reviewed full text articles written in English from 1992 to 2018 reporting the success rates and functional outcomes of either single-stage exchange or double-stage exchange for knee arthroplasty revision performed for chronic infection. In the case of double-stage exchange, particular attention was paid to the type of spacer: articulating or static.In all, 32 articles were analysed: 14 articles for single-stage including 687 patients and 18 articles for double-stage including 1086 patients. The average eradication rate was 87.1% for the one-stage procedure and 84.8% for the two-stage procedure. The functional outcomes were similar in both groups: the average Knee Society Knee Score was 80.0 in the single-stage exchange group and 77.8 in the double-stage exchange. The average range of motion was 91.4° in the single-stage exchange group and 97.8° in the double-stage exchange group.Single-stage exchange appears to be a viable alternative to two -stage exchange in cases of chronic periprosthetic joint infection around the knee, provided there are no contra-indications, producing similar results in terms of eradication rates and functional outcomes, and offering the advantage of a unique surgical procedure, lower morbidity and reduced costs.

To determine the current status of <i>Bd</i> infection in amphibians, we conducted a global meta-analysis. Using PubMed, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang database searches, we retrieved a total of 111 articles from 2000 to 2021. Based on these, we estimated the <i>Bd</i> prevalence to be 18.54% (95% CI: 13.76-20.52) in current extent amphibians. Among these populations, the prevalence of <i>Bd</i> in Asia was the lowest at 7.88% (95% CI: 1.92-8.71). Further, no <i>Bd</i> infection was found in Vietnam. However, the prevalence of <i>Bd</i> in Oceania was the highest at 36.34% (95% CI: 11.31-46.52). The <i>Bd</i> prevalence in Venezuela was as high as 49.77% (95% CI: 45.92-53.62). After 2009, the global <i>Bd</i> prevalence decreased to 18.91% (95% CI: 13.23-21.56). The prevalence of <i>Bd</i> in epizootic populations was significantly higher than enzootic populations. The highest prevalence of <i>Bd</i> was detected with real-time PCR at 20.11% (95% CI: 13.12-21.38). The prevalence of <i>Bd</i> in frogs was the highest at 20.04% (95% CI: 13.52-21.71), and this different host was statistically significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05). At the same time, we analyzed the geographic factors (longitude, latitude, elevation, rainfall and temperature) that impacted the fungal prevalence in amphibians. Our meta-analysis revealed that factors including region, disease dynamic, detection method, host and climate may be sources of the observed heterogeneity. These results indicate that chytridiomycosis was a consistent threat to amphibians from 2000 to 2021. Based on different habitat types and geographical conditions, we recommend formulating corresponding control plans and adopting reasonable and efficient biological or chemical methods to reduce the severity of such diseases.","Chytridiomycosis is an amphibian fungal disease caused by <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> (<i>Bd</i>), which has caused large-scale death and population declines on several continents around the world.

The gut and upper respiratory tract (URT) microbiota harbor a dynamic and complex population of microorganisms and have strong interaction with host immune system homeostasis. However, our knowledge about microbiota and its association with SARS-CoV-2 is still limited. We aimed to systematically review the effects of gut microbiota on the SARS-CoV-2 infection and its severity and the impact that SARS-CoV-2 could have on the gut microbiota.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched the keywords in the online databases of Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane on December 31, 2021. After duplicate removal, we performed the screening process in two stages; title/abstract and then full-text screening. The data of the eligible studies were extracted into a pre-designed word table. This study adhered to the PRISMA checklist and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale Bias Assessment tool.<h4>Results</h4>Sixty-three publications were included in this review. Our study shows that among COVID-19 patients, particularly moderate to severe cases, the gut and lung microbiota was different compared to healthy individuals. In addition, the severity, and viral load of COVID-19 disease would probably also be influenced by the gut, and lung microbiota's composition.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study concludes that there was a significant difference in the composition of the URT, and gut microbiota in COVID-19 patients compared to the general healthy individuals, with an increase in opportunistic pathogens. Further, research is needed to investigate the probable bidirectional association of COVID-19 and human microbiome.","<h4>Background and aims</h4>Alteration in humans' gut microbiota was reported in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Both industrially developed and impoverished nations are affected by the illness. DS is often associated with ill-fitting dentures or a fungal infection with <i>Candida</i> spp. <i>Candida</i> is normally found in the oral cavity microbiota, but it can be harmful to the health of elderly people with underlying diseases. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to offer the most recent information about the epidemiology, etiology, and global distribution of <i>Candida</i> species associated with DS through a systematic review. Several databases, including Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus, were used to conduct an extensive search of the literature published in the previous 20 years. The selection of studies was performed by two authors. The extracted data were as follows: author, year of publication, country, sample, frequency of DS, method of diagnosing stomatitis, species of <i>Candida</i>, risk factors, and etiology of the disease. The JBI Critical appraisal tools were used to assess the quality of the studies. Eventually, twenty-eight studies were included in the systematic review. Twenty-one studies investigated DS, while seven studies examined <i>Candida</i> colonization in patients using removable dentures. The results show that the main causes of DS include the type of dentures, continuous wearing of dentures, and the formation of a <i>Candida</i> biofilm, which is facilitated by poor dental hygiene. Additionally, previous studies have pinpointed the significance of the salivary flow, saliva composition, and salivary pH. The findings of the current review indicate that it is crucial to monitor denture wearers for the appearance of DS, especially the patients whose immunity has been impaired due to a systemic condition. Finally, frequent follow-ups should include a clinical examination and microbial swabs of the palatal mucosa and the mucosal surface of the denture.","Denture stomatitis (DS) is a very common disease in wearers of removable complete and partial dentures with a worldwide prevalence in the range of 20-67%.

10.21037/jtd-23-1456,Differentiating inflammatory and malignant pulmonary lesions on 3T lung MRI with radiomics of apparent diffusion coefficient maps and T2w derived radiomic feature maps.,"<h4>Background</h4>Differentiating inflammatory from malignant lung lesions continues to be challenging in clinical routine, frequently requiring invasive methods like biopsy. Therefore, we aimed to investigate if inflammatory and malignant pulmonary lesions could be distinguished noninvasively using radiomics of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and radiomic feature maps calculated from T2-weighted (T2w) 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lung.<h4>Methods</h4>Fifty-four patients with an unclear pulmonary lesion on computed tomography (CT) were prospectively included and examined by 3T MRI with T2w and diffusion-weighted sequences (b values of 50 and 800). ADC maps were calculated automatically. All patients underwent biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Sixteen patients were excluded (e.g., motion artifacts), leaving 19 patients each with malignant and inflammatory pulmonary lesions. Target lesions were defined by biopsy or as the largest lesion (BAL-based pathogen detection), and two readers placed volumes of interest (VOIs) around the lesions on T2w images and ADC maps. One hundred and seven features were conventionally extracted from the ADC maps using PyRadiomics. T2w images were converted to 107 parametric feature maps per patient using a PyRadiomics-based, pretested software tool developed by our group. VOIs were copied from T2w images to T2 maps for feature quantification. Features were tested for significant differences using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Diagnostic performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and interreader agreement by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs).<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-eight features derived from ADC maps differed significantly between malignant and inflammatory pulmonary lesions, with areas under the curve (AUCs) >0.90 for 5 and >0.80 for 27 features, compared with 67 features from T2 maps (5 features with AUCs >0.80). ICCs were excellent throughout.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ADC and T2 maps differentiate inflammatory and malignant pulmonary lesions with outstanding (ADC) and excellent (T2w derived feature maps) diagnostic performance. MRI could thus guide the further diagnostic workup and a timely initiation of the appropriate therapy.","<h4>Background</h4>Differentiating inflammatory from malignant lung lesions continues to be challenging in clinical routine, frequently requiring invasive methods like biopsy.

The involvement of <i>C. albicans</i> secretome on host biological processes has been demonstrated. However, the immunoregulatory function of <i>C. albicans</i> secretome released under hypoxic condition remains unclear. This study demonstrated the differences in cytokine responses and protein profiles between secretomes prepared under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, the immunoregulatory effects of heat shock protein SSA1(Ssa1), a protein candidate enriched in the hypoxic secretome, were investigated. Stimulation of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) with Ssa1 resulted in the significant production of interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α as well as the significant expression of M2b macrophage markers (CD86, CD274 and tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 14), suggesting that <i>C. albicans</i> Ssa1 may promote macrophage polarization towards an M2b-like phenotype. Proteomic analysis of Ssa1-treated BMMs also revealed that Ssa1 reduced inflammation-related factors (IL-18-binding protein, IL-1 receptor antagonist protein, OX-2 membrane glycoprotein and cis-aconitate decarboxylase) and enhanced the proteins involved in anti-inflammatory response (CMRF35-like molecule 3 and macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor). Based on these results, we investigated the effect of Ssa1 on <i>C. albicans</i> infection and showed that Ssa1 inhibited the uptake of <i>C. albicans</i> by BMMs. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>C. albicans</i> alters its secretome, particularly by promoting the release of Ssa1, to modulate host immune response and survive under hypoxic conditions.","<i>Candida albicans</i> is an opportunistic pathogenic yeast that can survive in both normoxic and hypoxic environments.

Nitrosative stress caused by excessive accumulation of NO is harmful for fungal infection. While the S-nitrosoglutathione reductase GSNOR-mediated de-nitrosylation removes excess NO toxicity during appressorium formation to promote infection. Through an indoTMT switch labeling proteomics technique, 741 S-nitrosylation sites in 483 proteins are identified. Key appressorial proteins, such as Mgb1, MagB, Sps1, Cdc42, and septins, are activated by GSNOR through de-nitrosylation. Removing S-nitrosylation sites of above proteins is essential for proper protein structure and appressorial function. Therefore, GSNOR-mediated de-nitrosylation is an essential regulator for appressorium formation. It is also shown that breaking NO homeostasis by NO donors, NO scavengers, as well as chemical inhibitor of GSNOR, shall be effective methods for fungal disease control.","As a signaling molecule, nitric oxide (NO) regulates the development and stress response in different organisms.

This study aimed to enhance the biological features of propolis extract by loading it onto active film. Firstly, extraction was performed using three solvent systems, and their total phenolic, flavonoid, and antioxidant activity was measured. Propolis ethanol extract (EEP) was evaluated for phenolic fraction content and then chosen to prepare a chitosan-loaded emulsion with several concentrations. The antibacterial, anti-mycotic, and anti-mycotoxigenic properties of the extract and nanoemulsion were assessed. PPE's cytotoxicity and nanoemulsion were evaluated using brine shrimp and cell line assays. Results indicate higher phenolic (322.57 ± 4.28 mg GAE/g DW), flavonoid (257.64 ± 5.27 mg QE/g DW), and antioxidant activity of the EEP. The phenolic fraction is distinguished by 18 phenolic acids with high <i>p</i>-hydroxybenzoic content (171.75 ± 1.64 µg/g) and 12 flavonoid compounds with high pinocembrin and quercetin content (695.91 ± 1.76 and 532.35 ± 1.88 µg/g, respectively). Phenolic acid derivatives (3,4-Dihydroxybenzaldehyde, 3,4-Dihydroxyphenol acetate, and di-methoxy cinnamic) are also found. Concentrations of 50, 100, 150, and 200 ng EEP loaded on chitosan nanoemulsion reflect significant antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria, particularly methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) and toxigenic fungi, particularly <i>Fusarium</i>. Among the four EEP-loaded concentrations, the nanoemulsion with 150 ng showed outstanding features. Using a simulated medium, 150 and 200 ng of EEP-loaded chitosan nanoemulsion concentrations can stop zearalenone production in <i>Fusarium</i> media with complete fungi inhibition. Also, it reduced aflatoxins production in <i>Aspergillus</i> media, with fungal inhibition (up to 47.18%). These results recommended the EEP-chitosan application for pharmaceutics and medical use as a comprehensive wound healing agent.","Propolis is a naturally occurring substance with beneficial properties; bees produce it from various plant sources, and it is an anti-inflammatory and therapeutic resinous substance.

Also, it reduced aflatoxins production in <i>Aspergillus</i> media, with fungal inhibition (up to 47.18%). These results recommended the EEP-chitosan application for pharmaceutics and medical use as a comprehensive wound healing agent.",EuropePMC
10.3390/toxins15100613,IoT for Monitoring Fungal Growth and <i>Ochratoxin A</i> Development in Grapes Solar Drying in Tunnel and in Open Air.,"Optimisation of solar drying to reduce fungal growth and <i>Ochratoxin A</i> (OTA) contamination is a crucial concern in raisin and currant production. Stochastic and deterministic analysis has been utilized to investigate environmental indicators and drying characteristics. The analysis was performed using two seedless grape varieties (<i>Crimson</i>-red and <i>Thompson</i>-white) that were artificially inoculated with <i>Aspergillus carbonarius</i> during open-air and tunnel drying. Air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) were measured and analysed during the drying experiment, along with grape surface temperature (T<sub>s</sub>), and water activity (a<sub>w</sub>). The grape moisture content, fungal colonization, and OTA contamination were estimated, along with the water diffusivity (D<sub>eff</sub>) and peel resistance (r<sub>peel</sub>) to water transfer. Monitoring the surface temperature of grapes is essential in the early detection of fungal growth and OTA contamination. As surface temperature should be carried out continuously, remote sensing protocols, such as infrared sensors, provide the most efficient means to achieve this. Furthermore, data collection and analysis could be conducted through the Internet of Things (IoT), thereby enabling effortless accessibility. The average T<sub>s</sub> of the grapes was 6.5% higher in the tunnel than in the open-air drying. The difference between the RH of air and that in the plastic crates was 16.26-17.22%. In terms of CFU/mL, comparison between white and red grapes in the 2020 and 2021 experiments showed that the red grapes exhibited significantly higher values than the white grapes. Specifically, the values for red grapes were 4.3 in 2021 to 3.4 times in 2020 higher compared to the white grapes. On the basis of the conducted analysis, it was concluded that tunnel drying provided some advantages over open-air drying, provided that hygienic and managerial requirements are met.","Optimisation of solar drying to reduce fungal growth and <i>Ochratoxin A</i> (OTA) contamination is a crucial concern in raisin and currant production.

10.1093/jisesa/ieac051,Cloning and Functional Characterization of a Novel β-GRP Gene From Melanotus cribricollis.,"In this study, a novel β-1,3-glucan recognition protein gene (β-GRP) was identified from Melanotus cribricollis, and its potential role in the immune response was investigated. The full length of β-GRP cDNA (Accession Number: MT941530) was 1644 bp, encoding a protein composed of 428 amino acids. The theoretical molecular weight and the isoelectric point were 51.53 kDa and 6.17, respectively. The amino acid sequence of β-GRP from M. cribricollis was closely related to that of. β-GRP-like from Photinus pyralis, and was predicted to contain conserved GH16 domain without glucanase active site. The results of real-time quantitative PCR showed that fungal infection of Metarhizium pingshaense may significantly upregulated the expression level of β-GRP gene. The RNAi suppression of β-GRP gene expression significantly increased the corrected cumulative mortality. Meanwhile, antimicrobial peptide genes defensin and lysozyme were significantly downregulated after interference of β-GRP. Taken together, these results suggest that β-GRP of M. cribricollis probably participates in the host immune system by mediating the expression of antimicrobial peptides. This study provides comprehensive insights into the innate immune system of insect larvae.","In this study, a novel β-1,3-glucan recognition protein gene (β-GRP) was identified from Melanotus cribricollis, and its potential role in the immune response was investigated.

This study aimed to apply deep learning algorithms for rapidly discriminating between fungal keratitis (FK) and bacterial keratitis (BK).<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 2167 anterior segment images retrospectively acquired from 194 patients with 128 patients with BK (1388 images, 64.1%) and 66 patients with FK (779 images, 35.9%) were used to develop the model. The images were split into training, validation, and test sets. Three convolutional neural networks consisting of VGG19, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 were trained to classify images. Performance of each model was evaluated using precision (positive predictive value), sensitivity (recall), F1 score (test's accuracy), and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Ensemble learning was then applied to improve classification performance.<h4>Results</h4>The classification performance in F1 score (95% confident interval) of VGG19, DenseNet121, and RestNet50 was 0.78 (0.72-0.84), 0.71 (0.64-0.78), and 0.68 (0.61-0.75), respectively. VGG19 also demonstrated the highest AUPRC of 0.86 followed by RestNet50 (0.73) and DenseNet (0.60).

10.1128/msystems.00953-24,Histone deacetylase HDAC3 regulates ergosterol production for oxidative stress tolerance in the entomopathogenic and endophytic fungus <i>Metarhizium robertsii</i>.,"Oxidative stress is encountered by fungi in almost all niches, resulting in fungal degeneration or even death. Fungal tolerance to oxidative stress has been extensively studied, but the current understanding of the mechanisms regulating oxidative stress tolerance in fungi remains limited. The entomopathogenic and endophytic fungus <i>Metarhizium robertsii</i> encounters oxidative stress when it infects insects and develops a symbiotic relationship with plants, and we found that host reactive oxygen species (ROSs) greatly limited fungal growth in both insects and plants. We identified a histone H3 deacetylase (HDAC3) that catalyzed the deacetylation of lysine 56 of histone H3. Deleting <i>Hdac3</i> significantly reduced the tolerance of <i>M. robertsii</i> to oxidative stress from insects and plants, thereby decreasing fungal ability to colonize the insect hemocoel and plant roots. HDAC3 achieved this by regulating the expression of three genes in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, which includes the lanosterol synthase gene <i>Las1</i>. The deletion of <i>Hdac3</i> or <i>Las1</i> reduced the ergosterol content and impaired cell membrane integrity. This resulted in an increase in ROS accumulation in fungal cells that were thus more sensitive to oxidative stress. We further showed that HDAC3 regulated the expression of the three ergosterol biosynthesis genes in an indirect manner. Our work significantly advances insights into the epigenetic regulation of oxidative stress tolerance and the interactions between <i>M. robertsii</i> and its plant and insect hosts.IMPORTANCEOxidative stress is a common challenge encountered by fungi that have evolved sophisticated mechanisms underlying tolerance to this stress.

The wide spread of resistance and sharing resistance genes between different types of bacteria led to emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) microorganisms. This problem is exacerbated when microorganisms create biofilms, which can boost bacterial resistance by up to 1000-fold and increase the emergence of MDR infections. The absence of novel and potent antimicrobial compounds is linked to the rise of multidrug resistance. This has sparked international efforts to develop new and improved antimicrobial agents as well as innovative and efficient techniques for antibiotic administration and targeting. There is an evolution in nanotechnology in recent years in treatment and prevention of the biofilm formation and MDR infection. The development of nanomaterial-based therapeutics, which could overcome current pathways linked to acquired drug resistance, is a hopeful strategy for treating difficult-to-treat bacterial infections. Additionally, nanoparticles' distinct size and physical characteristics enable them to target biofilms and treat resistant pathogens. This review highlights the current advances in nanotechnology to combat MDR and biofilm infection. In addition, it provides insight on development and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, spread of MDR and XDR infection, and development of nanoparticles and mechanisms of their antibacterial activity. Moreover, this review considers the difference between free antibiotics and nanoantibiotics, and the synergistic effect of nanoantibiotics to combat planktonic bacteria, intracellular bacteria and biofilm.

10.3390/jcm11247307,Long-Term Surveillance and Management of Urological Complications in Chronic Spinal Cord-Injured Patients.,"Bladder dysfunction is a common complication after chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Patients may experience renal function loss, urinary tract infection (UTI), urolithiasis, bladder cancer, and even life-threatening events such as severe sepsis or renal failure. Suitable patient care may prevent UTI and urinary incontinence, decrease medication use, and preserve renal function. As the primary goal is to preserve renal function, management should be focused on facilitating bladder drainage, the avoidance of UTI, and the maintenance of a low intravesical pressure for continence and complete bladder emptying. Currently, several bladder management options are available to SCI patients: (1) reflex voiding; (2) clean intermittent catheterization; (3) indwelling catheterization. The target organ may be the bladder or the bladder outlet. The purposes of intervention include the following: (1) increasing bladder capacity and/or decreasing intravesical pressure; (2) increasing bladder outlet resistance; (3) decreasing bladder outlet resistance; (4) producing detrusor contractility; (5) urinary diversion. Different bladder management methods and interventions may have different results depending on the patient's lower urinary tract dysfunction. This review aims to report the current management options for long-term bladder dysfunction in chronic SCI patients. Furthermore, we summarize the most suitable care plans for improving the clinical outcome of SCI patients.","Bladder dysfunction is a common complication after chronic spinal cord injury (SCI).

10.1186/s13756-020-00775-w,Treating infections with ionizing radiation: a historical perspective and emerging techniques.,"<h4>Background</h4>Widespread use and misuse of antibiotics have led to a dramatic increase in the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria, while the discovery and development of new antibiotics is declining. This has made certain implant-associated infections such as periprosthetic joint infections, where a biofilm is formed, very difficult to treat. Alternative treatment modalities are needed to treat these types of infections in the future. One candidate that has been used extensively in the past, is the use of ionizing radiation. This review aims to provide a historical overview and future perspective of radiation therapy in infectious diseases with a focus on orthopedic infections.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic search strategy was designed to select studies that used radiation as treatment for bacterial or fungal infections. A total of 216 potentially relevant full-text publications were independently reviewed, of which 182 focused on external radiation and 34 on internal radiation. Due to the large number of studies, several topics were chosen. The main advantages, disadvantages, limitations, and implications of radiation treatment for infections were discussed.<h4>Results</h4>In the pre-antibiotic era, high mortality rates were seen in different infections such as pneumonia, gas gangrene and otitis media. In some cases, external radiation therapy decreased the mortality significantly but long-term follow-up of the patients was often not performed so long term radiation effects, as well as potential increased risk of malignancies could not be investigated. Internal radiation using alpha and beta emitting radionuclides show great promise in treating fungal and bacterial infections when combined with selective targeting through antibodies, thus minimizing possible collateral damage to healthy tissue.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The novel prospects of radiation treatment strategies against planktonic and biofilm-related microbial infections seem feasible and are worth investigating further. However, potential risks involving radiation treatment must be considered in each individual patient.","<h4>Background</h4>Widespread use and misuse of antibiotics have led to a dramatic increase in the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria, while the discovery and development of new antibiotics is declining.

The highly coloured <i>H. coccineum</i> is used by communities in Larrakia country for dyeing garments and occasionally to treat snake bites. Previous studies into <i>H. coccineum</i> have focused on its taxonomic classification, with this being the first evaluation of the chemical composition of the plant. <i>Haemodoraceae</i> plants are reported to contain phenylphenalenones (PhPs), which are highly conjugated polycyclic oxygenated aromatic hydrocarbons. We report the characterisation of 20 compounds extracted from the rhizome of <i>H. coccineum</i>: four sugars and 16 compounds belonging to the PhP family. The compounds include five aglycones and seven glycosylated compounds, of which four contain malonate esters in their structures. Characterisation of these compounds was achieved through 1D and 2D NMR, MS analysis and comparison to the known phytochemistry of other species from the <i>Haemodorum</i> genus.

Nanofibers are filaments or thread-like structures in the nanometer size range that are fabricated using various polymers, such as natural or synthetic polymers or their combination. The size or diameter of the nanofibers depends upon the polymers, the techniques of preparation, and the design specification. The four major processing techniques, phase separation, self-assembly, template synthesis, and electrospinning, are most commonly used for the fabrication of nanofibers. Nanofibers have a unique structure that needs a multimethod approach to study their morphology and characterization parameters. They are gaining attention as drug delivery carriers, and the substantially vast surface area of the skin makes it a potentially promising strategy for topical drug products for various skin disorders such as psoriasis, skin cancers, skin wounds, bacterial and fungal infections, etc. However, the large-scale production of nanofibers with desired properties remains challenging, as the widely used electrospinning processes have certain limitations, such as poor yield, use of high voltage, and difficulty in achieving in situ nanofiber deposition on various substrates. This review highlights the insights into fabrication strategies, applications, recent clinical trials, and patents of nanofibers for different skin disorders in detail.

Since diabetes is a risk factor for many infectious diseases, this increase probably adds to the large infectious disease burden in tropical countries. We reviewed the literature to investigate the interface between diabetes and infections in tropical countries, including the WHO-defined neglected tropical diseases. Although solid data are sparse, patients with diabetes living in tropical countries most likely face increased risks of common and health-care-associated infections, as well as infected foot ulcers, which often lead to amputation. There is strong evidence that diabetes increases the severity of some endemic infections such as tuberculosis, melioidosis, and dengue virus infection. Some HIV and antiparasitic drugs might induce diabetes, whereas helminth infections appear to afford some protection against future diabetes. But there are no or very scarce data for most tropical infections and for possible biological mechanisms underlying associations with diabetes. The rise in diabetes and other non-communicable diseases puts a heavy toll on health systems in tropical countries. On the other hand, complications common to both diabetes and some tropical infections might provide an opportunity for shared services-for example, for eye health (trachoma and onchocerciasis), ulcer care (leprosy), or renal support (schistosomiasis).

MATERIAL AND METHODS Four groups (n=24) of restorative material sheets (n=24) were prepared using 3M Z350 composite resin (ZR), zinc phosphate cement (ZPC), glass-ionomer (GI), and ICON permeable resin (IPR). Six volunteers wore a plaque-collection device equipped with the 4 restorative material sheets for 48 hours. Plaque samples were collected, and Miseq sequencing was applied to obtain template DNA fragments for microbial diversity analysis. The data were analyzed with nonparametric tests. RESULTS The microbial diversity on the ZPC surface was significantly lower than that on GI and IPR surfaces. The abundance of Firmicutes and Streptococcus on the ZPC surface was significantly higher than on the surfaces of GI and IPR. In contrast, the abundance of Porphyromonas on the surface of ZPC was significantly lower than that on GI and IPR surfaces. (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The results of the present study might serve as a basis for material selection under different oral microbial conditions to provide more accurate treatments and restorative procedures in the oral cavity.","BACKGROUND This study aimed to provide precise material selection guidance for proper clinical restoration and treatment of plaque-related oral diseases, such as dental caries and periodontal diseases.

Evidence suggests that the interaction between host immune cells and fungal EVs induces modulation of the immune system. Most of the studies on fungal EVs have been conducted in the context of fungal infections; therefore, there is a knowledge gap in what concerns the production of EVs by yeasts in other contexts rather than infection and that may affect human health. In this work, we characterized EVs obtained by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia fermentans strains isolated from a fermented milk product with probiotic properties. The immunomodulation abilities of EVs produced by these strains have been studied in vitro through immune assays after internalization from human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Results showed a significant reduction in antigen presentation activity of dendritic cells treated with the fermented milk EVs. The small RNA fraction of EVs contained mainly yeast mRNA sequences, with a few molecular functions enriched in strains of two different species isolated from the fermented milk. Our results suggest that one of the mechanisms behind the anti-inflammatory properties of probiotic foods could be mediated by the interactions of human immune cells with yeast EVs.","Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid-bilayered particles, containing various biomolecules, including nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, released by cells from all the domains of life and performing multiple communication functions.

Phosphoinositide signaling does not immediately appear to offer attractive targets due to its evolutionary conservation across the Eukaryota. However, recent evidence argues otherwise. Herein, we discuss the evidence identifying Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) as unexplored portals through which phosphoinositide signaling in virulent fungi can be chemically disrupted with exquisite selectivity. Recent identification of lead compounds that target fungal Sec14 proteins, derived from several distinct chemical scaffolds, reveals exciting inroads into the rational design of next generation Sec14 inhibitors.

However, the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying this resistance are still unclear. To understand these mechanisms, transcriptomics was conducted in resistant Tx2783 and susceptible BTx623 sorghum genotypes infested with sugarcane aphids. A principal component analysis revealed differences in the transcriptomic profiles of the two genotypes. The pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) indicated the upregulation of a set of genes related to signal perception (nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat proteins), signal transduction [mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling, salicylic acid (SA), and jasmonic acid (JA)], and plant defense (transcription factors, flavonoids, and terpenoids). The upregulation of the selected DEGs was verified by real-time quantitative PCR data analysis, performed on the resistant and susceptible genotypes. A phytohormone bioassay experiment showed a decrease in aphid population, plant mortality, and damage in the susceptible genotype when treated with JA and SA. Together, the results indicate that the set of genes, pathways, and defense compounds is involved in host plant resistance to aphids. These findings shed light on the specific role of each DEG, thus advancing our understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of host plant resistance to aphids.","Sugarcane aphid has emerged as a major pest of sorghum recently, and a few sorghum accessions were identified for resistance to this aphid so far.

A nasopharyngeal swab for reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was positive for both cases. After recovering from COVID-19, both patients developed signs and symptoms suggestive of mucormycosis, which were confirmed by a fungal smear. They were managed with liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) and other adjunctive medicines. The first patient developed a massive bout of epistaxis during surgical debulking of his fungal mass. He underwent anterior nasal packing and emergency digital subtraction angiogram which revealed an aneurysm of the right ICA which was treated by coiling of the aneurysm and parent artery occlusion of the right ICA. The second patient had a history of post-COVID-19 mucormycosis which was managed by LAmB, surgical debulking, and posaconazole.

10.1186/s11671-025-04234-6,Ocular drug delivery systems based on nanotechnology: a comprehensive review for the treatment of eye diseases.,"Ocular drug delivery is a significant challenge due to the intricate anatomy of the eye and the various physiological barriers. Conventional therapeutic approaches, while effective to some extent, often fall short in effectively targeting ocular diseases, resulting in suboptimal therapeutic outcomes due to factors such as poor ocular bioavailability, frequent dosing requirements, systemic side effects, and limited penetration through ocular barriers. This review elucidates the eye's intricate anatomy and physiology, prevalent ocular diseases, traditional therapeutic modalities, and the inherent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic limitations associated with these modalities. Subsequently, it delves into nanotechnology-based solutions, presenting breakthroughs in nanoformulations such as nanocrystals, liposomes, dendrimers, and nanoemulsions that have demonstrated enhanced drug stability, controlled release, and deeper ocular penetration. Additionally, it explores a range of nanosized carriers, including nano-structured lipid carriers, hydrogels, nanogels, nanoenzymes, microparticles, conjugates, exosomes, nanosuspensions, viral vectors, and polymeric nanoparticles, and their applications. Unique insights include emerging innovations such as nanowafers and transcorneal iontophoresis, which indicate paradigm shifts in non-invasive ocular drug delivery. Furthermore, it sheds light on the advantages and limitations of these nanotechnology-based platforms in addressing the challenges of ocular drug delivery. Though nano-based drug delivery systems are drawing increasing attention due to their potential to enhance bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy, the review ends up emphasizing the imperative need for further research to drive innovation and improve patient outcomes in ophthalmology.","Ocular drug delivery is a significant challenge due to the intricate anatomy of the eye and the various physiological barriers.

10.3389/fphar.2021.674682,Bioactive Compounds as Potential Agents for Sexually Transmitted Diseases Management: A Review to Explore Molecular Mechanisms of Action.,"Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are produced by pathogens like bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses, and may generate severe health problems such as cancer, ulcers, and even problems in the newborn. This narrative review aims to present updated information about the use of natural bioactive compounds for the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections. A search of the literature was performed using databases and search engines such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Science Direct. From the pharmacotherapeutic management point of view, any strategies for prevention should contain medical approaches. The bioactive compounds obtained from natural products have shown biological effects against different microorganisms for the treatment of these diseases. The main results showed antimicrobial, antiprotozoal, antifungal and antiviral effects such as HIV. Also, the molecular mechanisms, signalling pathways and action targets of natural compounds were highlighted, thus justifying bacterial and antifungal inhibition, apoptosis or reduction of viral replication. From the data of our study, we can conclude that natural compounds may be a significant source for adjuvant drugs / complementary therapies in the treatment of STDs. With all these benefits, the future must conduct extensive clinical trials and the development of pharmaceutical nanotechnologies for a greater therapeutic effect.","Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are produced by pathogens like bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses, and may generate severe health problems such as cancer, ulcers, and even problems in the newborn.

10.1128/spectrum.03614-23,Human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells exhibit antifungal activity against <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> and other filamentous fungi.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) and mucormycosis are life-threatening diseases, especially among immunocompromised patients. Drug-resistant <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> strains have been isolated worldwide, which can pose a serious clinical problem. As IA mainly occurs in patients with compromised immune systems, the ideal therapeutic approach should aim to bolster the immune system. In this study, we focused on Vγ9Vδ2 T cells that exhibit immune effector functions and examined the possibility of harnessing this unconventional T cell subset as a novel therapeutic modality for IA. A potent antifungal effect was observed when <i>A. fumigatus</i> (<i>Af293</i>) hyphae were challenged by Vγ9Vδ2 T cells derived from peripheral blood. In addition, Vγ9Vδ2 T cells exhibited antifungal activity against hyphae of all <i>Aspergillus</i> spp., <i>Cunninghamella bertholletiae</i>, and <i>Rhizopus microsporus</i> but not against their conidia. Furthermore, Vγ9Vδ2 T cells also exhibited antifungal activity against azole-resistant <i>A. fumigatus</i>, indicating that Vγ9Vδ2 T cells could be used for treating drug-resistant <i>A. fumigatus</i>. The antifungal activity of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells depended on cell-to-cell contact with <i>A. fumigatus</i> hyphae, and degranulation characterized by CD107a mobilization seems essential for this activity against <i>A. fumigatus</i>. Vγ9Vδ2 T cells could be developed as a novel modality for treating IA or mucormycosis.<h4>Importance</h4>Invasive aspergillosis (IA) and mucormycosis are often resistant to treatment with conventional antifungal agents and have a high mortality rate. Additionally, effective antifungal treatment is hindered by drug toxicity, given that both fungal and human cells are eukaryotic, and antifungal agents are also likely to act on human cells, resulting in adverse effects. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic agents specifically targeting fungi is challenging. This study demonstrated the antifungal activity of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells against various <i>Aspergillus</i> spp. and several <i>Mucorales in vitro</i> and discussed the mechanism underlying their antifungal activity. We indicate that adoptive immunotherapy using Vγ9Vδ2 T cells may offer a new therapeutic approach to IA.","Invasive aspergillosis (IA) and mucormycosis are life-threatening diseases, especially among immunocompromised patients.

Gene silencing technology offers new opportunities to develop new formulations or new pathogen-resistant plants for reducing impacts of agricultural systems. Recent studies offered the proof of concept that the symptoms of gray mold can be reduced by downregulating Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) and 2 (DCL2) genes of Botrytis cinerea. In this study, we demonstrate that both solutions based on dsRNA topical treatment and in planta expression targeting BcDCL1 and BcDCL2 genes can be used to control the strawberry gray mold, the most harmful disease for different fruit crops. 50, 70 and 100 ng μL<sup>-1</sup> of naked BcDCL1/2 dsRNA, sprayed on plants of Fragaria x ananassa cultivar Romina in the greenhouse, displayed significant reduction of susceptibility, compared to the negative controls, but to a lesser extent than the chemical fungicide. Three independent lines of Romina cultivar were confirmed for their stable expression of the hairpin gene construct that targets the Bc-DCL1 and 2 sequences (hp-Bc-DCL1/2), and for the production of hp construct-derived siRNAs, by qRT-PCR and Northern blot analyses. In vitro and in vivo detached leaves, and fruits from the hp-Bc-DCL1/2 lines showed significantly enhanced tolerance to this fungal pathogen compared to the control. This decreased susceptibility was correlated to the reduced fungal biomass and the downregulation of the Bc-DCL1 and 2 genes in B. cinerea. These results confirm the potential of both RNAi-based products and plants for protecting the cultivated strawberry from B. cinerea infection, reducing the impact of chemical pesticides on the environment and the health of consumers.","<h4>Key message</h4>Gene silencing of BcDCL genes improves gray mold disease control in the cultivated strawberry.

The results show that AMF increased maize growth on Cd-polluted soils, resulting in increases in root length, surface area, volume and branch number, with the effects being stronger in farmland than in wasteland and slopeland soils; increased malic acid and succinic acid secretion 1.3-fold and 1.1-fold, respectively, in roots on farmland soil; enhanced the iron- and manganese-oxidized Cd concentration by 22.6%, and decreased the organic-bound Cd concentration by 12.9% in the maize rhizosphere on farmland soil; and increased Cd uptake 12.5-fold and 1.7-fold in shoots and by 25.7% and 86.6% in roots grown on farmland and slopeland soils, respectively. Moreover, shoot Cd uptake presented significant positive correlations with root surface area and volume and LMWOA concentrations.

Notably, none of the isolates of any species exhibited growth at the highest evaluated peptide concentration (200 µg/ml). Synergistic effects were observed when combining the peptide and fluconazole. C14R affects biofilm and growth of <i>C. albicans</i> and <i>C. auris</i>. Cell membrane disruptions were observed in both species after treatment with the peptide. It was confirmed that C14R form pores in <i>C. albicans</i>' membrane.<h4>Discussion</h4>C14R has a potent antifungal activity against a large set of clinical isolates of both <i>C. albicans</i> and <i>C. auris</i>, showing its capacity to disrupt <i>Candida</i> membranes. This antifungal activity remains consistent across isolates regardless of their clinical source. Furthermore, the absence of correlation between MICs to C14R and resistance to fluconazole indicates the peptide's potential effectiveness against fluconazole-resistant strains.

The aim of this study was to evaluate C14R, an analog derived from peptide BP100, as a potential antimicrobial peptide against the prevalent opportunistic yeast <i>Candida albicans</i> and the emergent multidrug-resistant yeast <i>Candida auris</i>.<h4>Methods</h4>Antifungal susceptibility testing of C14R against 99 C<i>. albicans</i> and 105 C<i>. auris</i> clinical isolates from Colombia, was determined by broth microdilution. Fluconazole was used as a control antifungal. The synergy between C14R and fluconazole was assessed in resistant isolates. Assays against fungal biofilm and growth curves were also carried out. Morphological alterations of yeast cell surface were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. A permeability assay verified the pore-forming ability of C14R.<h4>Results</h4><i>C. albicans</i> and <i>C. auris</i> isolates had a geometric mean MIC against C14R of 4.42 µg/ml and 5.34 µg/ml, respectively.

Herein, we report a novel anti-biofilm strategy of mucus-permeable sonodynamic therapy (mp-SDT) based on ultrasound (US)-mediated amphotericin B-loaded PEGylated PLGA nanoparticles (AmB-NPs) to overcome mucus barrier and enable the eradication of <i>C. albicans</i> biofilm.<h4>Methods</h4>AmB-NPs were fabricated using ultrasonic double emulsion method, and their physicochemical and sonodynamic properties were determined. The mucus and biofilm permeability of US-mediated AmB-NPs were further investigated. Moreover, the anti-biofilm effect of US-mediated AmB-NPs treatment was thoroughly evaluated on mucus barrier abiotic biofilm, epithelium-associated biotic biofilm, and <i>C. albicans-</i>induced rabbit vaginal biofilms model. In addition, the ultrastructure and secreted cytokines of epithelial cells and the polarization of macrophages were analyzed to investigate the regulation of local cellular immune function by US-mediated AmB-NPs treatment.<h4>Results</h4>Polymeric AmB-NPs display excellent sonodynamic performance with massive singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) generation. US-mediated AmB-NPs could rapidly transport through mucus and promote permeability in biofilms, which exhibited excellent eradicating ability to <i>C. albicans</i> biofilms. Furthermore, in the vaginal epithelial cells (VECs)-associated <i>C. albicans</i> biofilm model, the mp-SDT scheme showed the strongest biofilm eradication effect, with up to 98% biofilm re-formation inhibition rate, improved the ultrastructural damage, promoted local immune defense enhancement of VECs, and regulated the polarization of macrophages to the M1 phenotype to enhance macrophage-associated antifungal immune responses. In addition, mp-SDT treatment exhibited excellent therapeutic efficacy against <i>C. albicans-</i>induced rabbit vaginitis, promoted the recovery of mucosal epithelial ultrastructure, and contributed to the reshaping of a healthier vaginal microbiome.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The synergistic anti-biofilm strategies of mp-SDT effectively eradicated <i>C. albicans</i> biofilm and simultaneously regulated local antifungal immunity enhancement, which may provide a new approach to treat refractory drug-resistant biofilm-associated mucosal candidiasis.","<h4>Background</h4><i>Candida albicans</i> (<i>C. albicans</i>) forms pathogenic biofilms, and the dense mucus layer secreted by the epithelium is a major barrier to the traditional antibiotic treatment of mucosa-associated <i>C. albicans</i> infections.

Aspergillosis is the most common source of opportunistic fungal infection in humans. IA can cause serious complications related to high morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients.<h4>Presentation of case</h4>We report a case of a 22-year-old female with a chief complaint of having a hole in the roof of her mouth. She was diagnosed with SLE in 2009. She had been consuming oral methylprednisolone ever since. In 2018, she experienced worsened symptoms and was hospitalized. She experienced swelling and bleeding of her gums and some of her teeth becoming loose and falling out, and then developing a hole in the roof of her mouth. Subsequently, she was treated with oral cyclophosphamide, oral mycophenolate sodium, and oral fluconazole. She was asked to stop taking oral methylprednisolone. In 2019, the palate biopsy was performed and showed <i>Aspergillus</i> spp. invading the palate. Afterward, the patient was referred to our clinic for defect closure. The patient was operated on for debridement and reconstruction of the defect. There was no recurrence of the defect or complications observed in the follow-up. The patient was satisfied with the surgical results.<h4>Discussion</h4>IA is a destructive and potentially harmful opportunistic fungal infection and treatments with surgical interventions should be well-thought-out in immunocompromised patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The management of IA are controlling any underlying diseases and surgical debridement or necrotomy. Generally, antifungal therapy and prompt surgical intervention are successful in managing invasive aspergillosis.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a fungal infection caused by Aspergillus species (spp.).

Hence, knowledge about simple and low-cost synthesis methods of materials with good structural and antimicrobial properties is of great importance. A material obtained through the combination of a nanoscale hydroxyapatite material (with good biocompatibility) and titanium dioxide (with good degradation properties of organic molecules) can absorb and decompose bacteria. In this investigation, three different synthesis routes used to prepare hydroxyapatite/titanium dioxide nanomaterials are examined. The morphology and semiquantitative chemical composition are characterized by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX). The obtained materials' phase and structural characterization are determined using the X-ray powder diffraction method (XRD). The crystallite sizes of the obtained materials are in the range of 8 nm to 15 nm. Based on XRD peak positions, the hexagonal hydroxyapatite phases are formed in all samples along with TiO<sub>2</sub> anatase and rutile phases. According to SEM and TEM analyses, the morphology of the prepared samples differs depending on the synthesis route. The EDX analysis confirmed the presence of Ti, Ca, P, and O in the obtained materials. The IR spectroscopy verified the vibration bands characteristic for HAp and titanium.

10.3389/fmicb.2022.949152,Microbiome and pathobiome analyses reveal changes in community structure by foliar pathogen infection in rice.,"Increasing evidence suggests that the plant rhizosphere may recruit beneficial microbes to suppress soil-borne pathogens, but microbiome assembly due to foliar pathogen infection and ecological mechanisms that govern microbiome assembly and functions in the diseased host are not fully understood. To provide a comprehensive view of the rice-associated microbiome, we compared bacterial and fungal communities of healthy rice and those infected with <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, the causal agent of blast disease. We found that the soil had a greater diversity of bacterial and fungal communities than plant endospheric communities. There was no significant dysbiosis of bacterial and fungal microbiome diversity due to disease, but it caused a substantial alteration of bacterial community structure in the root and rhizosphere compartments. The pathobiome analysis showed that the microbiome community structure of leaf and grain tissues was changed markedly at the pathogen infection site, although the alpha diversity did not change. Correspondingly, the relative abundances of some bacteria and fungi were clearly altered in symptomatic tissues. We noted an increase in <i>Rhizobium</i> bacteria and a decline of <i>Tylospora, Clohesyomyces</i>, and <i>Penicillium</i> fungi in the symptomatic leaf and grain tissues from both locations. According to the inferred microbial network, several direct interactions between <i>M. oryzae</i> and other microbes were identified. The majority of edges in the interaction network were positive in diseased samples; contrastingly, the number of edges was much lower in the healthy samples. With source tracking analysis, we observed a sharp contrast in the source of root endosphere bacteria due to <i>Magnaporthe</i> infection. Whereas the majority (71%) of healthy root bacteria could be tracked from the soil, only a very small portion (17%) could be tracked from the soil for diseased samples. These results advanced our understanding and provided potential ideas and a theoretical basis for studying pathobiome and exploiting the microbiome for sustainable agriculture.","Increasing evidence suggests that the plant rhizosphere may recruit beneficial microbes to suppress soil-borne pathogens, but microbiome assembly due to foliar pathogen infection and ecological mechanisms that govern microbiome assembly and functions in the diseased host are not fully understood.

We hypothesized that B. bassiana conidia microgranular formulations (MGF) with the additives acetone, lactic acid, and sugar increase Ae. aegypti adult exposure, thus improving their biocontrol effectiveness. Beauveria bassiana strain four (BBPTG4) conidia stability was assessed after 0 d, 5 d, and 30 d storage at 25 °C ± 2 °C with additives or in MGF after 91 d of storage at 25 °C ± 2 °C or 4 °C ± 1 °C, whereas mortality was evaluated after adult exposure to MGF + conidia, using home-made traps. Additives did not show toxicity to conidia. In addition, we observed that sugar in MGF increased Ae. aegypti adults’ attraction and their viability resulted in a 3-fold reduction after 5 d and 1- to 4-fold decrease after 30 d of storage, and formulations were less attractive (p < 0.05). Conidia stability was higher on MGF regardless of the storage temperature, losing up to 2.5-fold viability after 91 d.

10.1186/s12864-023-09143-5,Differential bumble bee gene expression associated with pathogen infection and pollen diet.,"<h4>Background</h4>Diet and parasitism can have powerful effects on host gene expression. However, how specific dietary components affect host gene expression that could feed back to affect parasitism is relatively unexplored in many wild species. Recently, it was discovered that consumption of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) pollen reduced severity of gut protozoan pathogen Crithidia bombi infection in Bombus impatiens bumble bees. Despite the dramatic and consistent medicinal effect of sunflower pollen, very little is known about the mechanism(s) underlying this effect. However, sunflower pollen extract increases rather than suppresses C. bombi growth in vitro, suggesting that sunflower pollen reduces C. bombi infection indirectly via changes in the host. Here, we analyzed whole transcriptomes of B. impatiens workers to characterize the physiological response to sunflower pollen consumption and C. bombi infection to isolate the mechanisms underlying the medicinal effect. B. impatiens workers were inoculated with either C. bombi cells (infected) or a sham control (un-infected) and fed either sunflower or wildflower pollen ad libitum. Whole abdominal gene expression profiles were then sequenced with Illumina NextSeq 500 technology.<h4>Results</h4>Among infected bees, sunflower pollen upregulated immune transcripts, including the anti-microbial peptide hymenoptaecin, Toll receptors and serine proteases. In both infected and un-infected bees, sunflower pollen upregulated putative detoxification transcripts and transcripts associated with the repair and maintenance of gut epithelial cells. Among wildflower-fed bees, infected bees downregulated immune transcripts associated with phagocytosis and the phenoloxidase cascade.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Taken together, these results indicate dissimilar immune responses between sunflower- and wildflower-fed bumble bees infected with C. bombi, a response to physical damage to gut epithelial cells caused by sunflower pollen, and a strong detoxification response to sunflower pollen consumption. Identifying host responses that drive the medicinal effect of sunflower pollen in infected bumble bees may broaden our understanding of plant-pollinator interactions and provide opportunities for effective management of bee pathogens.","<h4>Background</h4>Diet and parasitism can have powerful effects on host gene expression. However, how specific dietary components affect host gene expression that could feed back to affect parasitism is relatively unexplored in many wild species. Recently, it was discovered that consumption of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) pollen reduced severity of gut protozoan pathogen Crithidia bombi infection in Bombus impatiens bumble bees. Despite the dramatic and consistent medicinal effect of sunflower pollen, very little is known about the mechanism(s) underlying this effect. However, sunflower pollen extract increases rather than suppresses C. bombi growth in vitro, suggesting that sunflower pollen reduces C. bombi infection indirectly via changes in the host. Here, we analyzed whole transcriptomes of B. impatiens workers to characterize the physiological response to sunflower pollen consumption and C. bombi infection to isolate the mechanisms underlying the medicinal effect. B. impatiens workers were inoculated with either C. bombi cells (infected) or a sham control (un-infected) and fed either sunflower or wildflower pollen ad libitum. Whole abdominal gene expression profiles were then sequenced with Illumina NextSeq 500 technology.<h4>Results</h4>Among infected bees, sunflower pollen upregulated immune transcripts, including the anti-microbial peptide hymenoptaecin, Toll receptors and serine proteases.

In this work, the immunomodulatory properties of EVs produced under oxidative stress conditions or at host concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> by the fungal pathogen <i>Candida albicans</i> were investigated. The interaction of EVs with human pro-monocytes of the U-937 cell line was established, and the most notable effect was attributed to oxidative stress-related EVs. The immunomodulatory potential of tested EVs against human THP-1 macrophages was verified using cytotoxicity assay, ROS-production assay, and the measurement of cytokine production. All fungal EVs tested did not show a significant cytotoxic effect on THP-1 cells, although a slight pro-oxidative impact was indicated for EVs released by <i>C. albicans</i> cells grown under oxidative stress. Furthermore, for all tested types of EVs, the pro-inflammatory properties related to increased IL-8 and TNF-α production and decreased IL-10 secretion were demonstrated, with the most significant effect observed for EVs released under oxidative stress conditions.","Human immune cells possess the ability to react complexly and effectively after contact with microbial virulence factors, including those transported in cell-derived structures of nanometer sizes termed extracellular vesicles (EVs).

10.1371/journal.pbio.3002389,The murine meninges acquire lymphoid tissue properties and harbour autoreactive B cells during chronic Trypanosoma brucei infection.,"The meningeal space is a critical brain structure providing immunosurveillance for the central nervous system (CNS), but the impact of infections on the meningeal immune landscape is far from being fully understood. The extracellular protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness, accumulates in the meningeal spaces, ultimately inducing severe meningitis and resulting in death if left untreated. Thus, sleeping sickness represents an attractive model to study immunological dynamics in the meninges during infection. Here, by combining single-cell transcriptomics and mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) with in vivo interventions, we found that chronic T. brucei infection triggers the development of ectopic lymphoid aggregates (ELAs) in the murine meninges. These infection-induced ELAs were defined by the presence of ER-TR7+ fibroblastic reticular cells, CD21/35+ follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), CXCR5+ PD1+ T follicular helper-like phenotype, GL7+ CD95+ GC-like B cells, and plasmablasts/plasma cells. Furthermore, the B cells found in the infected meninges produced high-affinity autoantibodies able to recognise mouse brain antigens, in a process dependent on LTβ signalling. A mid-throughput screening identified several host factors recognised by these autoantibodies, including myelin basic protein (MBP), coinciding with cortical demyelination and brain pathology. In humans, we identified the presence of autoreactive IgG antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of second stage HAT patients that recognised human brain lysates and MBP, consistent with our findings in experimental infections. Lastly, we found that the pathological B cell responses we observed in the meninges required the presence of T. brucei in the CNS, as suramin treatment before the onset of the CNS stage prevented the accumulation of GL7+ CD95+ GC-like B cells and brain-specific autoantibody deposition. Taken together, our data provide evidence that the meningeal immune response during chronic T. brucei infection results in the acquisition of lymphoid tissue-like properties, broadening our understanding of meningeal immunity in the context of chronic infections. These findings have wider implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying the formation ELAs during chronic inflammation resulting in autoimmunity in mice and humans, as observed in other autoimmune neurodegenerative disorders, including neuropsychiatric lupus and multiple sclerosis.","The meningeal space is a critical brain structure providing immunosurveillance for the central nervous system (CNS), but the impact of infections on the meningeal immune landscape is far from being fully understood.

To reduce the economic loss, it is necessary to reject the infected citrus fruit before storage and transportation. However, the infected area in the early stage of decay is almost invisible on the fruit surface, so the detection of early decayed citrus is very challenging. In this study, a structured-illumination reflectance imaging (SIRI) system combined with a visible light-emitting diode (LED) lamp and a monochrome camera was developed to detect early fungal infection in oranges. Under sinusoidal modulation illumination with spatial frequencies of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.25 cycles mm<sup>-1</sup>, three-phase-shifted images with phase offsets of - 2π/3, 0, and 2π/3 were acquired for each spatial frequency. The direct component (DC) and alternating component (AC) images were then recovered by image demodulation using a three-phase-shifting approach. Compared with the DC image, the decayed area can be clearly identified in the AC image and RT image (AC/DC). The optimal spatial frequency was determined by analyzing the AC image and pixel intensity distribution. Based on the texture features extracted from DC, AC, and RT images, four kinds of classification models including partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), support vector machine (SVM), least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) were established to detect the infected oranges, respectively. Model optimization was also performed by extracting important texture features. Compared to all models, the PLS-DA model developed based on eight texture features of RT images achieved the optimal classification accuracy of 96.4%.

10.7759/cureus.38944,Life Expectancy and Mortality After Lower Extremity Amputation: Overview and Analysis of Literature.,"Lower limb amputation (LLA) is a major surgical procedure with a significant impact on quality of life and mortality rates as well. Previous studies have shown that mortality rates following LLA can range from 9-17% within 30 days in the UK. This study systematically evaluates and reviews the published literature on life expectancy, mortality, and survival rates following lower extremity amputation (LEA). We have conducted a comprehensive search on Medline, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central databases resulting in 87 full-text articles. After a thorough review, only 45 (52.9%) articles met the minimum inclusion criteria for the study. Our analysis indicated 30-day mortality rates following LEA ranged from 7.1% to 51.4%, with an average mortality rate of 16.45% (SD 14.35) per study. Furthermore, 30-day mortality rates following below-knee amputation (BKA) and above-knee amputation (AKA) were found to be between 6.2% to 51.4%, X= 17.16% ± 19.46 SD and 12.7 to 21.7%, X= 16.15% ± 4.17 SD, respectively. Our review provides a comprehensive insight into the life expectancy, mortality, and survival rates following LEA. These findings highlight the importance of considering various factors, including patient age, presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, heart failure, and renal failure, and lifestyle factors such as smoking, in determining prognosis following LLA. Further research is necessary to determine strategies for improving outcomes and reducing mortality in this patient population.","Lower limb amputation (LLA) is a major surgical procedure with a significant impact on quality of life and mortality rates as well.

10.1093/genetics/iyae072,The Caenorhabditis elegans cuticle and precuticle: a model for studying dynamic apical extracellular matrices in vivo.,"Apical extracellular matrices (aECMs) coat the exposed surfaces of animal bodies to shape tissues, influence social interactions, and protect against pathogens and other environmental challenges. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, collagenous cuticle and zona pellucida protein-rich precuticle aECMs alternately coat external epithelia across the molt cycle and play many important roles in the worm's development, behavior, and physiology. Both these types of aECMs contain many matrix proteins related to those in vertebrates, as well as some that are nematode-specific. Extensive differences observed among tissues and life stages demonstrate that aECMs are a major feature of epithelial cell identity. In addition to forming discrete layers, some cuticle components assemble into complex substructures such as ridges, furrows, and nanoscale pillars. The epidermis and cuticle are mechanically linked, allowing the epidermis to sense cuticle damage and induce protective innate immune and stress responses. The C. elegans model, with its optical transparency, facilitates the study of aECM cell biology and structure/function relationships and all the myriad ways by which aECM can influence an organism.","Apical extracellular matrices (aECMs) coat the exposed surfaces of animal bodies to shape tissues, influence social interactions, and protect against pathogens and other environmental challenges.

10.1186/s12870-024-05200-7,Attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy reveals environment specific phenotypes in clonal Japanese knotweed.,"<h4>Background</h4>Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica var. japonica), a problematic invasive species, has a wide geographical distribution. We have previously shown the potential for attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and chemometrics to segregate regional differentiation between Japanese knotweed plants. However, the contribution of environment to spectral differences remains unclear. Herein, the response of Japanese knotweed to varied environmental habitats has been studied. Eight unique growth environments were created by manipulation of the red: far-red light ratio (R: FR), water availability, nitrogen, and micronutrients. Their impacts on plant growth, photosynthetic parameters, and ATR-FTIR spectral profiles, were explored using chemometric techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines (SVM) and partial least squares regression. Key wavenumbers responsible for spectral differences were identified with PCA loadings, and molecular biomarkers were assigned. Partial least squared regression (PLSR) of spectral absorbance and root water potential (RWP) data was used to create a predictive model for RWP.<h4>Results</h4>Spectra from plants grown in different environments were differentiated using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy coupled with SVM. Biomarkers highlighted through PCA loadings corresponded to several molecules, most commonly cell wall carbohydrates, suggesting that these wavenumbers could be consistent indicators of plant stress across species. R: FR most affected the ATR-FTIR spectra of intact dried leaf material. PLSR prediction of root water potential achieved an R2 of 0.8, supporting the potential use of ATR-FTIR spectrometers as sensors for prediction of plant physiological parameters.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Japanese knotweed exhibits environmentally induced phenotypes, indicated by measurable differences in their ATR-FTIR spectra. This high environmental plasticity reflected by key biomolecular changes may contribute to its success as an invasive species. Light quality (R: FR) appears critical in defining the growth and spectral response to environment. Cross-species conservation of biomarkers suggest that they could function as indicators of plant-environment interactions including abiotic stress responses and plant health.","<h4>Background</h4>Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica var. japonica), a problematic invasive species, has a wide geographical distribution.

To enhance the resilience of peach orchards, this study evaluated the physiological and biochemical responses of <i>Prunus</i> spp. rootstocks , 'Flordaguard' and 'MP-29,' under normoxia (sufficient oxygen content) or short-term hypoxia (low-oxygen content) and ambient or high temperature (40°C) in the root zone. Physiological responses measured were net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration, intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, water use efficiency, the leaf chlorophyll index, and the maximum potential quantum efficiency of photosystem II. The leaf concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, sulfur, boron, zinc, manganese, iron, and copper were also analyzed. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants analyzed were superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, peroxidase (POD) activity, catalase (CAT) activity, ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity, proline content, glycine betaine content (GB), lipid peroxidation (LPO), superoxide (O<sub>2</sub> <sup>-</sup>) concentration, and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) concentration. When subjected to root zone hypoxia or high temperature individually, 'MP-29' performed better physiologically than 'Flordaguard'. However, when root zone hypoxia and high temperature were combined, 'MP-29' performed better biochemically with enhanced antioxidant activity, osmolyte content, and nutrient absorption. Nutrient analysis of leaves revealed that 'MP-29' had higher N, P, K, Ca, and B concentrations than 'Flordaguard'. Consequently, 'MP-29' demonstrated greater tolerance to short-term exposure to the combined effects of high root zone temperature and hypoxia. This research contributes to identifying a suitable rootstock within the <i>Prunus</i> genus able to withstand root zone conditions that often result from severe weather events commonly experienced in Florida and other parts of the world.","Selecting the right rootstock is crucial for successful fruit production and managing both biotic and abiotic stresses in commercial fruit orchards.

Despite this, the immune response against C. auris infection is still not well understood. Hosts fight Candida infections through the immune system that recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as β-glucan, mannan, and chitin on the fungal cell wall. In this study, levels of β-glucan and mannan exposures in C. auris grown under different physiologically relevant stimuli were quantified by flow cytometry-based analysis. Lactate, hypoxia, and sublethal concentration of fluconazole trigger a decrease in surface β-glucan while low pH triggers an increase in β-glucan. There is no inverse pattern between exposure levels of β-glucan and mannan in the cell wall architecture among the three clades. To determine the effect of cell wall remodeling on the immune response, a phagocytosis assay was performed, followed by quantification of released cytokines by ELISA. Lactate-induced decrease in β-glucan leads to reduced uptake of C. auris by PMA-differentiated THP-1 and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Furthermore, reduced production of CCL3/MIP-1⍺ but not TNF-⍺ and IL-10 were observed. An in vivo infection analysis using silkworms reveals that a reduction in β-glucan triggers an increase in the virulence of C. auris. This study demonstrates that β-glucan alteration occurs in C. auris and serves as an escape mechanism from immune cells leading to increased virulence.","Candida auris is an emerging pathogenic yeast that has been categorized as a global public health threat and a critical priority among fungal pathogens.

We isolated, purified, and structurally elucidated antifungal secondary metabolites from red soil microbes and encapsulated them into chitosan (CS)-based nanoemulsion (NE) gel (NEG).<h4>Methods</h4>Three compounds were isolated and purified of which only one compound (Pure 2) showed potent antifungal activity (MFC: 8-132 µg/mL), which was also significantly (<i>P</i><0.05) more efficient than fluconazole (MFC: 32-132 µg/mL). Pure 2 was structurally elucidated using 1D- and 2D-NMR before its incorporation into NEG. The formulations were prepared by high-speed homogenization technique. Physicochemical and pharmacological characterizations of formulations (ie, droplet size, PDI, zeta potential, drug content, viscosity, SEM, FTIR, spreadability, in vitro drug release, ex vivo permeation, in vitro antifungal and in vivo antifungal activities) were assessed.<h4>Results</h4>NMR analyses identified the compound as a derivative of phthalic acid ester (PAE). The optimized formulations displayed a droplet size <100 nm, -ve zeta potential, and PDI <0.45. The drug content was within the official limit of pharmacopeia (ie, 100±10%). Insignificant changes (<i>P</i>>0.05) in the viscosity of the formulations stored were observed. The morphology of the formulations indicated mesh-like structure. The FTIR study indicated that there were no interactions between the drug and other ingredients of the formulations. Optimum spreadability was observed in all formulations.

Active life stages need to feed on a vertebrate host in order to complete their life cycle. To study processes such as tick-pathogen interactions or drug efficacy and pharmacokinetics, it is necessary to maintain tick colonies under defined laboratory conditions, typically using laboratory animals. The aim of this study was to test a membrane-based artificial feeding system (AFS) applicable for <i>Amblyomma</i> ticks using <i>Amblyomma tonelliae</i> as a biological model. Adult ticks from a laboratory colony were fed in a membrane-based AFS. For comparison, other <i>A. tonelliae</i> adults were fed on calf and rabbit. The proportions of attached (AFS: 76%; calf/rabbit: 100%) and engorged females (AFS: 47.4%; calf/rabbit: 100%) in the AFS were significantly lower compared to animal-based feeding (<i>p</i> = 0.0265). The engorgement weight of in vitro fed ticks (x¯ = 658 mg; SD ± 259.80) did not significantly differ from that of ticks fed on animals (<i>p</i> = 0.3272, respectively 0.0947). The proportion of females that oviposited was 100% for all three feeding methods. However, the incubation period of eggs (x¯ = 54 days; SD ± 7) was longer in the AFS compared to conventional animal-based feeding (<i>p</i> = 0.0014); x¯ = 45 days; SD ± 2 in the rabbit and (<i>p</i> = 0.0144). x¯ = 48 days; SD ± 2 in the calf). Egg cluster hatching (x¯ = 41%; SD ± 44.82) was lower in the AFS than in the other feeding methods (rabbit: x¯ = 74%; SD ± 20; <i>p</i> = 0.0529; calf: x¯ = 81%; SD ± 22; <i>p</i> = 0.0256). Although the attachment, development, and the hatching of AFS ticks were below those from animal-based feeding, the method may be useful in future experiments. Nevertheless, further experiments with a higher number of tick specimens (including immature life stages) and different attractant stimuli are required to confirm the preliminary results of this study and to evaluate the applicability of AFS for <i>Amblyomma</i> ticks as an alternative to animal-based feeding methods.","Hard ticks pose a threat to animal and human health.

BSIs are one of the most frequent lethal conditions that are managed in intensive care units (ICUs). In the case of septic shock, immune deficiency, and delayed treatment, even with adequate antimicrobial therapy and/or source control, the outcomes are often unfavorable.<h4>Methods</h4>this review article summarizes the epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of BSIs with a particular focus on ICU acquired BSIs (ICU-BSIs), which are usually caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. For this reason, their antimicrobial resistance patterns and therapeutic options have also been compiled.<h4>Results</h4>ICU-acquired BSIs prevail in 5-7% of ICU patients. <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosae</i> are the pathogens most often responsible for MDR infections. MDR <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> have seen their prevalence increase from 6.2% (1997-2000) to 15.8% (2013-2016) in recent years.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Considering that prevention and treatment of sepsis is nowadays considered a global health priority by the World Health Organization, it is our obligation to invest more resources into solving or reducing the spread of these unfaithful infections. It is relevant to identify patients with risk factors that make them more susceptible to BSIs, to guarantee earlier molecular or microbiological diagnoses, and more rapidly appropriate treatment by using de-escalation strategies where possible.","<h4>Background</h4>Bloodstream infections (BSIs) constitute a growing public health concern, are among the most severe nosocomial pathologies, and are considered a worldwide cause of unfaithful outcomes, increasing treatment costs and diagnostic uncertainties.

Soil-borne fungi cause a significant yield loss in mung beans. Our study was performed to identify the impact of different concentrations of MgO nanoparticles (MgONPs) and to assess the prevalence of Fusarium solani (F. solani) and Fusarium oxysporum (F. oxysporum) in mung bean plants under in vivo conditions and, subsequently, the remaining impacts on soil health. In vitro studies revealed that MgONPs could inhibit fungal growth. Mung bean plants treated with MgONPs showed a promotion in growth. The obtained MgONPs were applied to the roots of 14-day-old mung bean plants at a concentration of 100 µg/mL. The application of MgONPs at a concentration of 100 µg/mL caused an increase in mung bean seedlings. Compared to the control treated with water, plants exposed to MgONPs at 100 µg/mL showed improvements (p < 0.05) in shoot fresh weight (28.62%), shoot dry weight (85.18%), shoot length (45.83%), root fresh weight (38.88%), root dry weight (33.33%), root length (98.46%), and root nodule (70.75%). In the greenhouse, the severity of disease caused by F. solani decreased from approximately 44% to 25% and that by F. oxysporum from 39% to 11.4%, respectively. The results of this study confirm that the temporal growth of the soil microbial biomass was partially reduced or boosted following the nanoparticle drenching addition and/or plant infections at higher concentrations of 50 and 100 µg/mL while there was no significant decrease at the lowest concentration (25 µg/mL). The current research helps us to better understand how nanoparticles might be used to prevent a variety of fungal diseases in agricultural fields while avoiding the creation of environmental hazards to soil health.","The nanotechnology revolution is developing daily all over the world.

Most reported examples of this type of thermoregulatory response involve behavioral fevering. However depending upon the life history of a host-insect and that of the parasite or pathogen, the host may respond by cold-seeking behavior. Thermoregulation is not only ecologically important; it may affect the success of parasites and pathogens as biological control agents. We examined if Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) thermoregulates in response to infection by Beauveria bassiana, a fungal pathogen commonly used for biological control. Fungal-infected thrips preferentially moved to cooler areas (~12 °C) while healthy thrips sought out warmer temperatures (~24 °C). This cold-seeking behavior suppressed the growth of B. bassiana in infected thrips, and significantly improved survivorship of infected thrips. At 24 °C, males only survived up to 10 d after infection and females up to 20 d after infection, which was substantially poorer survivorship than that of corresponding healthy individuals. However, individuals of both sexes survived up to 48 d after infection at 12 °C, which was a much less severe reduction in survivorship compared with the effect of B. bassiana infection at 24 °C. The proportion of females among progeny from infected thrips at 12 °C was higher than at 24 °C. Therefore, cold-seeking behavior is beneficial to F. occidentalis when infected by B. bassiana, and its effects should be considered in the use of B. bassiana in biological control programs.","Behavioral thermoregulation is a defensive strategy employed by some insects to counter infections by parasites and pathogens.

The proportion of females among progeny from infected thrips at 12 °C was higher than at 24 °C. Therefore, cold-seeking behavior is beneficial to F. occidentalis when infected by B. bassiana, and its effects should be considered in the use of B. bassiana in biological control programs.",EuropePMC
10.3390/jpm10020037,Future Trends in Nebulized Therapies for Pulmonary Disease.,"Aerosol therapy is a key modality for drug delivery to the lungs of respiratory disease patients. Aerosol therapy improves therapeutic effects by directly targeting diseased lung regions for rapid onset of action, requiring smaller doses than oral or intravenous delivery and minimizing systemic side effects. In order to optimize treatment of critically ill patients, the efficacy of aerosol therapy depends on lung morphology, breathing patterns, aerosol droplet characteristics, disease, mechanical ventilation, pharmacokinetics, and the pharmacodynamics of cell-drug interactions. While aerosol characteristics are influenced by drug formulations and device mechanisms, most other factors are reliant on individual patient variables. This has led to increased efforts towards more personalized therapeutic approaches to optimize pulmonary drug delivery and improve selection of effective drug types for individual patients. Vibrating mesh nebulizers (VMN) are the dominant device in clinical trials involving mechanical ventilation and emerging drugs. In this review, we consider the use of VMN during mechanical ventilation in intensive care units. We aim to link VMN fundamentals to applications in mechanically ventilated patients and look to the future use of VMN in emerging personalized therapeutic drugs.","Aerosol therapy is a key modality for drug delivery to the lungs of respiratory disease patients.

Nevertheless, the number of species and their importance in the clinical setting still need to be well studied. Furthermore, their cross-sectional involvement in animal disease, plants, and human activities requires a multidisciplinary approach involving experts from various fields. This comprehensive review aims to provide a sharp vision of the cryptic <i>Aspergillus</i> species, from the importance of correct identification to the better management of the infections caused by these pathogens. The review also accentuates the importance of the One Health approach for this kind of microorganism, given the interconnection between environmental exposure and aspergillosis, embracing transversely the multidisciplinary process for managing the cryptic <i>Aspergillus</i> species.

Farmers need healthy soil and natural minerals for traditional farming, and production takes a little longer time. The soil-free farming method known as vertical farming (VF) requires a small land and consumes a very small amount of water than conventional soil-dependent farming techniques. With modern technologies like hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics, the notion of the VF appears to have a promising future in urban areas where farming land is very expensive and scarce. VF faces difficulty in the simultaneous monitoring of multiple indicators, nutrition advice, and plant diagnosis systems. However, these issues can be resolved by implementing current technical advancements like artificial intelligence (AI)-based control techniques such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), the internet of things (IoT), image processing as well as computer vision. This article presents a thorough analysis of ML and IoT applications in VF system. The areas on which the attention is concentrated include disease detection, crop yield prediction, nutrition, and irrigation control management. In order to predict crop yield and crop diseases, the computer vision technique is investigated in view of the classification of distinct collections of crop images. This article also illustrates ML and IoT-based VF systems that can raise product quality and production over the long term.

Biological materials, like biocellulose, might reducethese clinical problems substantially. In this prospective rodent study, a biocellulose mesh(produced by Gluconacetobacter xylinus) was implanted either by a sublay technique or assupplementation of the abdominal wall. After an observation period of 90 days, animals weresacrificed. The adhesions after the reconstruction of the abdominal wall were moderate. Thehistologic investigations revealed that the biocellulose itself was inert, with a minimal regenerativeresponse surrounding the mesh. The explanted mesh showed a minimal shrinkage (around 15%) aswell as a minimal loss of tear-out force, which might be without clinical relevance.

It utilizes exogenously applied double-stranded RNA to specifically reduce pest target gene expression using endogenous RNA interference machinery. In this study, SIGS methods were developed and optimized for powdery mildew fungi, which are widespread obligate biotrophic fungi that infect agricultural crops, using the known azole-fungicide target cytochrome P450 51 (CYP51) in the Golovinomyces orontii-Arabidopsis thaliana pathosystem. Additional screening resulted in the identification of conserved gene targets and processes important to powdery mildew proliferation: apoptosis-antagonizing transcription factor in essential cellular metabolism and stress response; lipid catabolism genes lipase a, lipase 1, and acetyl-CoA oxidase in energy production; and genes involved in manipulation of the plant host via abscisic acid metabolism (9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, xanthoxin dehydrogenase, and a putative abscisic acid G-protein coupled receptor) and secretion of the effector protein, effector candidate 2. Powdery mildew is the dominant disease impacting grapes and extensive powdery mildew resistance to applied fungicides has been reported. We therefore developed SIGS for the Erysiphe necator-Vitis vinifera system and tested six successful targets identified using the G. orontii-A. thaliana system. For all targets tested, a similar reduction in powdery mildew disease was observed between systems. This indicates screening of broadly conserved targets in the G. orontii-A. thaliana pathosystem identifies targets and processes for the successful control of other powdery mildew fungi.

One example is Mutator-like elements (MULEs, one type of terminal inverted repeat DNA TEs, or TIR TEs) capturing sequences as Pack-MULEs in plants. However, their origination mechanism remains perplexing, and whether TIR TEs mediate duplication in animals is almost unexplored. Here we identify 370 Pack-TIRs in 100 animal reference genomes and one Pack-TIR (Ssk-FB4) family in fly populations. We find that single-copy Pack-TIRs are mostly generated via transposition-independent gap filling, and multicopy Pack-TIRs are likely generated by transposition after replication fork switching. We show that a proportion of Pack-TIRs are transcribed and often form chimeras with hosts. We also find that Ssk-FB4s represent a young protein family, as supported by proteomics and signatures of positive selection. Thus, TIR TEs catalyze new gene structures and new genes in animals via both transposition-independent and -dependent mechanisms.","Despite long being considered as ""junk"", transposable elements (TEs) are now accepted as catalysts of evolution.

The use of entomopathogenic fungi may provide a biologically-based control method for these soil-dwelling life stages. The effectiveness of fungal isolates of Metarhizium and Beauveria species were screened under laboratory conditions against Queensland fruit fly. In bioassays, 16 isolates were screened for pathogenicity following exposure of third-instar larvae to inoculum-treated vermiculite used as a pupation substrate. The best performing Metarhizium sp. isolate achieved an average percentage mortality of 93%, whereas the best performing Beauveria isolate was less efficient, with an average mortality of 36%. Susceptibility to infection during different development stages was investigated using selected fungal isolates, with the aim of assessing all soil-dwelling life stages from third-instar larvae to final pupal stages and emerging adults. Overall, the third larval instar was the most susceptible stage, with average mortalities between 51-98% depending on the isolate tested. Moreover, adult mortality was significantly higher when exposed to inoculum during pupal eclosion, with mortalities between 56-76% observed within the first nine days post-emergence. The effect of temperature and inoculum concentration on insect mortality were assessed independently with candidate isolates to determine the optimum temperature range for fungal biological control activity and the rate required for application in field conditions.

At the highest risk of mortality are those with disseminated disease to the central nervous system, known as cerebral aspergillosis (CA). However, little is known about the risk factors contributing to disease amongst HM patients. A systematic review using PRISMA guidelines was undertaken to define HM patient subgroups, preventative measures, therapeutic interventions, and outcomes of patients with disseminated CA following IPA. The review resulted in the identification of 761 records, of which 596 articles were screened, with the final inclusion of 47 studies and 76 total patients. From included articles, the proportion of CA was assessed amongst HM patient subgroups. Further, pre-and post-infection characteristics, fungal species, and mortality were evaluated for the total population included and HM patient subgroups. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoid lymphoma, patients receiving corticosteroids as a part of their HM therapeutic regimen, and anti-fungal prophylaxis constitute the top identified patient populations at risk for disseminated CA. Overall, information presented here indicates that measures for the prevention of IPA should be taken in higher-risk HM patient subgroups. Specifically, the type of anti-fungal therapy used should be carefully considered for those patients with IPA and increased risk for cerebral dissemination. Additional reports detailing patient characteristics are needed to define further the risk of developing disseminated CA from IPA in patients with HMs.","Disseminated disease following invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) remains a significant contributor to mortality amongst patients with hematologic malignancies (HMs).

However, little is known about the risk factors contributing to disease amongst HM patients. A systematic review using PRISMA guidelines was undertaken to define HM patient subgroups, preventative measures, therapeutic interventions, and outcomes of patients with disseminated CA following IPA. The review resulted in the identification of 761 records, of which 596 articles were screened, with the final inclusion of 47 studies and 76 total patients. From included articles, the proportion of CA was assessed amongst HM patient subgroups. Further, pre-and post-infection characteristics, fungal species, and mortality were evaluated for the total population included and HM patient subgroups. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoid lymphoma, patients receiving corticosteroids as a part of their HM therapeutic regimen, and anti-fungal prophylaxis constitute the top identified patient populations at risk for disseminated CA. Overall, information presented here indicates that measures for the prevention of IPA should be taken in higher-risk HM patient subgroups. Specifically, the type of anti-fungal therapy used should be carefully considered for those patients with IPA and increased risk for cerebral dissemination. Additional reports detailing patient characteristics are needed to define further the risk of developing disseminated CA from IPA in patients with HMs.",EuropePMC

However, the discovery of several varieties of the light producing enzyme, luciferase, and the genetic engineering of bacteria, fungi, parasites and mice to make them emit light, either after administration of the luciferase substrate, or in the case of the bacterial lux operon without any exogenous substrate, has provided a new alternative. Dedicated bioluminescence imaging (BLI) cameras can record the light emitted from living animals in real time allowing non-invasive, longitudinal monitoring of the anatomical location and growth of infectious microorganisms as measured by strength of the BLI signal. BLI technology has been used to follow bacterial infections in traumatic skin wounds and burns, osteomyelitis, infections in intestines, Mycobacterial infections, otitis media, lung infections, biofilm and endodontic infections and meningitis. Fungi that have been engineered to be bioluminescent have been used to study infections caused by yeasts (Candida) and by filamentous fungi. Parasitic infections caused by malaria, Leishmania, trypanosomes and toxoplasma have all been monitored by BLI. Viruses such as vaccinia, herpes simplex, hepatitis B and C and influenza, have been studied using BLI. This rapidly growing technology is expected to continue to provide much useful information, while drastically reducing the numbers of animals needed in experimental studies.","Traditional methods of localizing and quantifying the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in living experimental animal models of infections have mostly relied on sacrificing the animals, dissociating the tissue and counting the number of colony forming units.

These changes include thermal tolerance of hosts, however the effects of fungal infections on thermal tolerances and behavioral responses to extreme temperatures (ET) across trophic levels have rarely been studied. We examined how a fungal pathogen, Beauveria bassiana, affects upper and lower thermal tolerance, and behavior of an herbivorous insect, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and its predator beetle, Hippodamia convergens. We compared changes in thermal tolerance limits (CT<sub>Min</sub> and CT<sub>Max</sub>), thermal boldness (voluntary exposure to ET), energetic cost (ATP) posed by each response (thermal tolerance and boldness) between healthy insects and insects infected with two fungal loads. Fungal infection reduced CT<sub>Max</sub> of both aphids and beetles, as well as CT<sub>Min</sub> of beetles. Fungal infection modified the tendency, or boldness, of aphids and predator beetles to cross either warm or cold ET zones (ETZ). ATP levels increased with pathogen infection in both insect species, and the highest ATP levels were found in individuals that crossed cold ETZ. Fungal infection narrowed the thermal tolerance range and inhibited thermal boldness behaviors to cross ET. As environmental temperatures rise, response to thermal stress will be asymmetric among members of a food web at different trophic levels, which may have implications for predator-prey interactions, food web structures, and species distributions.","Pathogens can modify many aspects of host behavior or physiology with cascading impacts across trophic levels in terrestrial food webs.

10.1371/journal.pntd.0006433,Entomopathogenic fungal infection leads to temporospatial modulation of the mosquito immune system.,"Alternative methods of mosquito control are needed to tackle the rising burden of mosquito-borne diseases while minimizing the use of synthetic insecticides, which are threatened by the rapid increase in insecticide resistance in mosquito populations. Fungal biopesticides show great promise as potential alternatives because of their ecofriendly nature and ability to infect mosquitoes on contact. Here we describe the temporospatial interactions between the mosquito Aedes aegypti and several entomopathogenic fungi. Fungal infection assays followed by the molecular assessment of infection-responsive genes revealed an intricate interaction between the mosquito immune system and entomopathogenic fungi. We observed contrasting tissue and time-specific differences in the activation of immune signaling pathways and antimicrobial peptide expression. In addition, these antifungal responses appear to vary according to the fungal entomopathogen used in the infection. Enzyme activity-based assays coupled with gene expression analysis of prophenoloxidase genes revealed a reduction in phenoloxidase (PO) activity in mosquitoes infected with the most virulent fungal strains at 3 and 6d post-fungal infection. Moreover, fungal infection led to an increase in midgut microbiota that appear to be attributed in part to reduced midgut reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity. This indicates that the fungal infection has far reaching effects on other microbes naturally associated with mosquitoes. This study also revealed that despite fungal recognition and immune elicitation by the mosquito, it is unable to successfully eliminate the entomopathogenic fungal infection. Our study provides new insights into this intricate multipartite interaction and contributes to a better understanding of mosquito antifungal immunity.","Alternative methods of mosquito control are needed to tackle the rising burden of mosquito-borne diseases while minimizing the use of synthetic insecticides, which are threatened by the rapid increase in insecticide resistance in mosquito populations.

Studies have frequently reported the role of ophiostomatoid fungi in bark beetle biology, but how fungal symbionts interact with host chemical defenses over time is needed. We first investigated how inoculations by three fungal symbionts of mountain pine beetle affect the terpene chemistry of live lodgepole pine trees. We then conducted a complimentary laboratory experiment specifically measuring the host metabolite degradation by fungi and collected the fungal organic volatiles following inoculations with the same fungal species on lodgepole pine logs. In both experiments, we analyzed the infected tissues for their terpene chemistry. Additionally, we conducted an olfactometer assay to determine whether adult beetles respond to the volatile organic chemicals emitted from each of the three fungal species. We found that all fungi upregulated terpenes as early as two weeks after inoculations. Similarly, oxygenated monoterpene concentrations also increased by several folds (only in logs). A large majority of beetles tested showed a strong attraction to two fungal species, whereas the other fungus repelled the beetles. Together this study shows that fungal symbionts can alter host defense chemistry, assist beetles in overcoming metabolite toxicity, and provide possible chemical cues for bark beetle attraction.","Bark beetles maintain symbiotic associations with a diversity of microbial organisms, including ophiostomatoid fungi.

We performed comparative proteomic studies to identify rapidly and locally expressed proteins in the leaf epidermis inoculated with fungal phytopathogen. The conidia solutions were dropped onto the Arabidopsis leaf surface, and then, we collected the epidermal tissues from inoculated and mock-treated leaves at 4 and 24 hpi. The label-free quantification methods showed that expressions of Arabidopsis proteins, which are related to defense signals, such as BAK1, MKK5, receptor-like protein kinases, transcription factors, and stomatal functions, were rapidly induced in the epidermal tissues of inoculated leaves. In contrast, most of them were not differentially regulated by fugal inoculation in the whole leaves. These findings clearly indicate that epidermal proteomics can monitor locally expressed proteins in inoculated areas of plant tissues. We also identified the 61 fungal proteins, including effector-like proteins specifically expressed on the Arabidopsis epidermis.

Despite the huge impact of <i>F. graminearum</i> on food security and mammalian health, the mechanisms used by <i>F. graminearum</i> to export virulence factors during infection are not fully understood and may involve non-classical secretory pathways. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid-bound compartments produced by cells of all kingdoms that transport several classes of macromolecules and are implicated in cell-cell communication. EVs produced by human fungal pathogens carry cargo that facilitate infection, leading us to ask whether plant fungal pathogens also deliver molecules that increase virulence via EVs. We examined the metabolome of the EVs produced by <i>F. graminearum</i> to determine whether they carry small molecules that could modulate plant-pathogen interactions. We discovered that EVs from <i>F. graminearum</i> were produced in liquid medium-containing inducers of trichothecene production, but in lower quantities compared to other media. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and cryo-electron microscopy revealed that the EVs were morphologically similar to EVs from other organisms; hence, the EVs were metabolically profiled using LC-ESI-MS/MS. This analysis revealed that EVs carry 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (BP-1) and metabolites that have been suggested by others to have a role in host-pathogen interactions.

10.1002/ece3.10536,Capturing red squirrels (<i>Sciurus vulgaris</i>) on camera: A cost-effective approach for monitoring relative abundance and habitat preference.,"Effective methods for monitoring animal populations are crucial for species conservation and habitat management. Motion-activated cameras provide an affordable method for passively surveying animal presence across the landscape but have mainly been used for studying large-bodied mammals. This paper explores the relative abundance and habitat preferences of red squirrels (<i>Sciurus vulgaris</i>) in coniferous forests using cameras and live trapping. The study was conducted in two forests (Newborough and Pentraeth) on Anglesey, North Wales, with a total of 50 sampling locations across four habitat categories. Detailed woodland structure and composition data were gathered around each sampling location. We found a strong positive correlation between the number of individual red squirrels live trapped over 10 days with the number of camera images of squirrels recorded during a previous 5-day period. The time interval between camera deployment and the first recorded image of a red squirrel showed a significant negative correlation with the number of individuals live trapped. Red squirrel relative abundance was negatively related to forest canopy openness, while the presence of Scots pine and increased tree species diversity were positively associated with the relative abundance of squirrels. There was also a strong site difference with lower relative abundance at Newborough compared with Pentraeth, which likely reflects the heavy thinning of mature forest at Newborough reducing tree crown connectivity. The results show that remotely activated cameras are an effective method for monitoring red squirrel populations across varying animal densities. The cameras also provided crucial information on red squirrel habitat preferences that can aid in woodland management and conservation efforts. Cameras have great potential to collect data on the population status of other small mammals, but it is essential that these methods are validated on a species-by-species basis.","Effective methods for monitoring animal populations are crucial for species conservation and habitat management.

The post-application persistence and efficacy of this fungus against <i>B. tabaci</i> were compared with that of the commercially available <i>C. javanica</i> Apopka97 strain over a two-year field study in cotton and vegetable crops. When blastospores of both strains were applied alone, whitefly populations were not effectively suppressed. Thus, JMS stylet oil was added to fungal treatments for enhancing efficacy and persistence. For 0-day samples, all fungal treatments caused similar but significant levels of immature mortality regardless of fungal strain, propagule form (conidia vs. blastospores), and application method (alone or mixed with JMS). In follow-up samplings, Wf GA17 blastospores + JMS achieved higher control levels than other treatments in some trials, but the efficacy did not last long.

The post-application persistence and efficacy of this fungus against <i>B. tabaci</i> were compared with that of the commercially available <i>C. javanica</i> Apopka97 strain over a two-year field study in cotton and vegetable crops. When blastospores of both strains were applied alone, whitefly populations were not effectively suppressed. Thus, JMS stylet oil was added to fungal treatments for enhancing efficacy and persistence. For 0-day samples, all fungal treatments caused similar but significant levels of immature mortality regardless of fungal strain, propagule form (conidia vs. blastospores), and application method (alone or mixed with JMS). In follow-up samplings, Wf GA17 blastospores + JMS achieved higher control levels than other treatments in some trials, but the efficacy did not last long.

10.3390/jof9030344,Crop Diversification to Control Rust in Faba Bean Caused by <i>Uromyces viciae-fabae</i>.,"<i>Uromyces viciae-fabae</i> is a highly specific biotrophic fungus that causes faba bean rust, one of the major diseases affecting this crop. We have assessed the feasibility of using intercropping (faba bean mixed with either pea, wheat or barley) or mixtures of susceptible and resistant cultivars to control rust both under field and controlled conditions. The results of four field intercropping experiments showed a significant reduction in rust severity on faba bean when intercropped with barley (average 22% reduction) but not with the other combinations. This reduction was also confirmed in studies under controlled conditions. The barrier effect of barley appears as the main mechanism explaining rust suppression. Additional experiments under controlled conditions showed that intercropping with barley did not influence the N content of faba bean and that different levels of N nutrition had no impact on rust severity in any case. The cultivar mixture field experiments showed that rust severity in the susceptible cultivar decreased as the proportion of the resistant cultivar in the mixture increased. The importance of the barrier effect of the resistant cultivars was determined in an experiment under controlled conditions. It can be concluded that crop diversification offers great potential to reduce rust in faba bean.","<i>Uromyces viciae-fabae</i> is a highly specific biotrophic fungus that causes faba bean rust, one of the major diseases affecting this crop.

In this population, taste and smell alterations (TSAs) are frequent but overlooked symptoms. The absence of effective therapeutic strategies and evidence-based guidelines constrain TSAs' early recognition, prevention and treatment (Tx), promoting cancer-related malnutrition and jeopardizing survival outcomes and quality of life.<h4>Objectives</h4>To systematically review the literature on TSAs in LC patients, understand the physiopathology, identify potential preventive and Tx strategies and to further encourage research in this area.<h4>Methods</h4>Literature search on English language articles indexed to PubMed, CINALH, SCOPUS and Web of Science using MeSH terms ""Lung neoplasms"",""Dysgeusia"", ""Olfaction Disorders"", ""Carcinoma, Small Cell"",""Carcinoma, Non- Small-Cell Lung ""Adenocarcinoma of Lung"",""Carcinoma, Large Cell"", and non-MeSH terms ""Parageusia"", ""Altered Taste"", ""Smell Disorder"", ""Paraosmia"", ""Dysosmia"",""Lung Cancer"" and ""Oat Cell Carcinoma"".<h4>Results</h4>Thirty-four articles were reviewed. TSAs may follow the diagnosis of LC or develop during cancer Tx. The estimated prevalence of self-reported dysgeusia is 35-38% in treatment-naïve LC patients, and 35-69% in those undergoing Tx, based on studies involving LC patients only.One prospective pilot trial and 1 RCT demonstrated a clinically significant benefit in combining flavor enhancement, smell and taste training and individualized nutritional counselling; a systematic review, 1 RCT and 1 retrospective study favored using intravenous or oral zinc-based solutions (150mg 2-3 times a day) for the prevention and Tx of chemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy (RT) -induced mucositis and subsequent dysgeusia.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This is the first review on dysgeusia and dysosmia in LC patients to our knowledge.

ENT conditions are underreported in PLWH. Also, little is known about the adenotonsillar microbiota and its relation to resident adaptive and innate immune cells. To bridge this gap, we characterized immune cell populations and the bacterial microbiota of two anatomical sites (adenoids, tonsils) and the oral cavity. Adenoids and tonsils were obtained from PLWH (<i>n</i> = 23) and HIV-seronegative individuals (SN, <i>n</i> = 16) after nasal surgery and tonsillectomy and processed for flow cytometry. Nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal swabs, and oral rinses were collected prior to surgery for 16S sequencing. Wilcoxon rank sum test, principal coordinate analysis, permutational multivariate analysis of variance, and linear discriminant analysis (LEfSe) were used to assess differences between PLWH and SN. Spearman's correlations were performed to explore interactions between the bacteriome and mucosal immune cells. Of the 39 individuals included, 30 (77%) were men; the median age was 32 years. All PLWH were on ART, with a median CD4 of 723 cells. ENT conditions were classified as inflammatory or obstructive, with no differences observed between PLWH and SN. PLWH had higher frequencies of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, increased T helper (Th)1 and decreased Th2 cells; no differences were observed for B cells and innate immune cells. Alpha diversity was comparable between PLWH and SN at all 3 anatomical sites (adenoids, tonsils, and oral cavity). The impact of HIV infection on the bacterial community structure at each site, as determined by Permutational multivariate analysis of variance, was minor and not significant. Two discriminant genera were identified in adenoids using LEfSe: <i>Staphylococcus</i> for PLWH and <i>Corynebacterium</i> for SN. No discriminant genera were identified in the oropharynx and oral cavity. Niche-specific differences in microbial diversity and communities were observed. PLWH shared less of a core microbiota than SN.

Natural plant resistance to thrips has become a prominent breeding target in commercial crops. The main reason for this is the shift toward banning key pesticides used for controlling thrips infestations and the lack of effective alternatives. Despite this urgent need for crop plants that are resistant, or tolerant, to thrips infestation, the toolbox for studying genetic resistance to this insect is still underdeveloped. Essentially, there is a lack of robust protocols for the screening and identification of thrips genes relevant to its performance on crop plants. To bridge this gap, we have developed a functional analysis screening method. Our approach relies on the, <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated, homogeneous, and transient ectopic expression of thrips genes in large tomato leaf discs followed by the assessment of thrips reproductive performance. The setup is designed to maintain gene expression during the course of the assay, where GFP signal in the control treatment is used as a reporter of expression. The screen is conducted in a climate box under controlled settings. As a result, multiple genes can be screened for their effect on thrips reproductive performance in a single experiment and in a relatively small space, without the need for generating stable transgenic plants. The method also eliminates the need for a greenhouse equipped to accommodate the combination of <i>A. tumefaciens</i>-infiltrations and thrips infestations. It is not only flexible and convenient for screening genes encoding putative thrips effectors but also for plant resistance genes or effector-targets of host plants and can be adapted for other crop plants, or other herbivorous arthropods.","Thrips (<i>Frankliniella occidentalis</i>) is a persistent plant pest that is able to vector pathogenic viruses.

10.1371/journal.pone.0296692,Effects of Pieris japonica (Ericaceae) dominance on cool temperate forest altered-understory environments and soil microbiomes in Southern Japan.,"The number of plants unpalatable to deer increases with increasing deer numbers. In the Kyushu Mountain area of Southern Japan, Pieris japonica (Ericaceae), an unpalatable shrub, has become the monodominant vegetation under evergreen conifer and deciduous broad-leaved tree stands. The monodominance of unpalatable plants in the understory has potential advantages and drawbacks; however, the effects of Pieris dominance are not well understood. To assess the effects of P. japonica dominances on forest environments and ecosystems, we investigated understory environments and soil microbiomes in Pieris-dominant sites. Under the deciduous broad-leaved trees, Pieris dominance leads to considerable Pieris leaf litter and humus weights and low soil bulk density and canopy openness. In the soil fungal community and fungal functional groups, the relative abundance of symbiotrophic fungi, particularly ectomycorrhizal fungi in Pieris-dominant sites were lower than in other-vegetation understory sites and saprotrophic fungi vice versa. Because few seedlings and saplings were found under Pieris shrubs, Pieris dominance in the understory might exclude other plant species. The results of this study will contribute to the Pieris population and forest management following deer overgrazing.","The number of plants unpalatable to deer increases with increasing deer numbers.

10.1093/plcell/koaf041,Powdery mildew induces chloroplast storage lipid formation at the expense of host thylakoids to promote spore production.,"Powdery mildews are obligate biotrophic fungi that manipulate plant metabolism to supply lipids to the fungus, particularly during fungal asexual reproduction when lipid demand is high. We found levels of leaf storage lipids (triacylglycerols, TAGs) are 3.5-fold higher in whole Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves with a 15-fold increase in storage lipids at the infection site during fungal asexual reproduction. Lipid bodies, not observable in uninfected mature leaves, were found in and external to chloroplasts in mesophyll cells underlying the fungal feeding structure. Concomitantly, thylakoid disassembly occurred and thylakoid membrane lipid levels decreased. Genetic analyses showed that canonical endoplasmic reticulum TAG biosynthesis does not support powdery mildew spore production. Instead, Arabidopsis chloroplast-localized DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE 3 (DGAT3) promoted fungal asexual reproduction. Consistent with the reported AtDGAT3 preference for 18:3 and 18:2 acyl substrates, which are dominant in thylakoid membrane lipids, dgat3 mutants exhibited a dramatic reduction in powdery mildew-induced chloroplast TAGs, attributable to decreases in TAG species largely comprised of 18:3 and 18:2 acyl substrates. This pathway for TAG biosynthesis in the chloroplast at the expense of thylakoids provides insights into obligate biotrophy and plant lipid metabolism, plasticity, and function. By understanding how photosynthetically active leaves can be converted into TAG producers, more sustainable and environmentally friendly plant oil production may be developed.","Powdery mildews are obligate biotrophic fungi that manipulate plant metabolism to supply lipids to the fungus, particularly during fungal asexual reproduction when lipid demand is high.

Concomitantly, thylakoid disassembly occurred and thylakoid membrane lipid levels decreased. Genetic analyses showed that canonical endoplasmic reticulum TAG biosynthesis does not support powdery mildew spore production. Instead, Arabidopsis chloroplast-localized DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE 3 (DGAT3) promoted fungal asexual reproduction. Consistent with the reported AtDGAT3 preference for 18:3 and 18:2 acyl substrates, which are dominant in thylakoid membrane lipids, dgat3 mutants exhibited a dramatic reduction in powdery mildew-induced chloroplast TAGs, attributable to decreases in TAG species largely comprised of 18:3 and 18:2 acyl substrates. This pathway for TAG biosynthesis in the chloroplast at the expense of thylakoids provides insights into obligate biotrophy and plant lipid metabolism, plasticity, and function. By understanding how photosynthetically active leaves can be converted into TAG producers, more sustainable and environmentally friendly plant oil production may be developed.",EuropePMC

The current study aimed to synthesize zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) by chemically or green method and investigate their antifungal activity against A. citri. The sizes of synthesized as measured by transmission electron microscope of ZnO-NPs were 88 and 65 nm for chemical and green methods, respectively. The studied prepared ZnO-NPs were applied, in vitro and in situ, at different concentrations (500, 1,000, and 2,000 µg/ml) in post-harvest treatment on navel orange fruits to verify the possible control effect against A. citri. Results of in vitro assay demonstrated that, at concentration 2,000 µg/ml, the green ZnO-NPs was able to inhibit about 61% of the fungal growth followed by 52% of chemical ZnO-NPs. In addition, scanning electron microscopy of A. citri treated in vitro with green ZnO-NPs showed swelling and deformation of conidia. Results showed also that, using a chemically and green ZnO-NPs at 2,000 µg/ml in situ in post-harvest treatment of orange, artificially-infected with A. citri, has reduced the disease severity to 6.92% and 9.23%, respectively, compared to 23.84% of positive control (non-treated fruits) after 20 days of storage. The out findings of this study may contribute to the development of a natural, effective, and eco-friendly strategy for eradicating harmful phytopathogenic fungi.","Citrus black rot is a serious disease of citrus plants caused by Alternaria citri.

The use of medicinal plants within these communities reflects a deep reservoir of knowledge, passed down through generations. The objective of this study was to conduct a scoping review to systematically analyze and synthesize the existing literature on the medicinal plants used by Quilombola communities in Brazil, with a focus on their therapeutic applications and cultural significance. The Population, Concept, and Context (PCC) strategy was utilized, where the population refers to the Quilombolas, the concept pertains to medicinal plants, and the context involves illness. A total of 888 studies were initially identified, but only 10 met the inclusion criteria, covering 297 plant species from 80 different families. These plants are employed in a wide range of therapeutic applications, with decoction, alcohol maceration, and infusion being the most common methods of preparation. The study highlights the rich ethnopharmacological knowledge held by Quilombola communities and underscores the need for greater recognition and integration of this traditional knowledge into public health practices. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of preserving and validating the use of medicinal plants by these communities, which could serve as a foundation for future pharmacological discoveries and the development of culturally appropriate health interventions.","Quilombola communities play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity through traditional management models.

10.1038/s41467-024-52204-w,A secreted fungal laccase targets the receptor kinase OsSRF3 to inhibit OsBAK1-OsSRF3-mediated immunity in rice.,"The identification effector targets and characterization of their functions are crucial for understanding pathogen infection mechanisms and components of plant immunity. Here, we identify the effector UgsL, a ustilaginoidin synthetase with a key role in regulating virulence of the rice false smut fungus Ustilaginoidea virens. Heterologous expression of UgsL in rice (Oryza sativa) enhances plant susceptibility to multiple pathogens, and host-induced gene silencing of UgsL enhances plant resistance to U. virens, indicating that UgsL inhibits rice immunity. UgsL interacts with STRUBBELIG RECEPTOR KINASE 3 (OsSRF3). Genome editing and overexpression of OsSRF3 demonstrate that OsSRF3 plays a pivotal role in the resistance of rice to multiple pathogens. Remarkably, overexpressing OsSRF3 enhances resistance without adversely affecting plant growth or yield. We show that BRASSINOSTEROID RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (OsBAK1) interacts with and phosphorylates OsSRF3 to activate pathogen-triggered immunity, inducing the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, a reactive oxygen species burst, callose deposition, and expression of defense-related genes. UgsL interferes with the phosphorylation of OsSRF3 by OsBAK1. Furthermore, UgsL mediates OsSRF3 degradation by facilitating its association with the ubiquitin-26S proteasome. Our results reveal that OsSRF3 positively regulates immunity in rice and that UgsL mediates its degradation, thereby inhibiting the activation of OsBAK1-OsSRF3-mediated immune pathways.","The identification effector targets and characterization of their functions are crucial for understanding pathogen infection mechanisms and components of plant immunity.

COVID-19 is a potentially life-threatening disease in SOT recipients, with an increased likelihood of progressing to severe disease, with the need of hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilatory support. This article presents an updated review of different aspects related to the outcome of COVID-19 in SOT recipients. In nvaccinated SOT recipients, COVID-19 is associated with a high mortality rate, in-patient care and ICU admission, and impaired graft function or rejection in severe disease. In vaccinated SOT recipients even after full vaccination, there is a reduction of the risk of mortality, but the course of COVID-19 may continue to be severe, influenced by the time from transplant, the net state of immunosuppression and having suffered graft rejection or dysfunction. SOT recipients develop lower immunity from mRNA vaccines with suboptimal response. Treatment with mAbs provides favorable outcomes in non-hospitalized SOT recipients at high risk for severe disease, with lower rates of hospitalization, emergency department visits, ICU care, progression to severe disease, and death. However, broad vaccination and therapeutic options are required, particularly in light of the tendency of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to adapt and evade both natural and vaccine-induced immunity.","Recipients of solid organ transplants (SOT) are at higher risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus especially due to chronic immunosuppression therapy and frequent multiple comorbid conditions.

10.1016/j.ebiom.2023.104607,IL-17C neutralization protects the kidney against acute injury and chronic injury.,"<h4>Background</h4>Interleukin-17C (IL-17C), a member of the IL-17 cytokine family, plays a pathogenic role in kidney diseases. Our previous studies have shown that pre-administration of IL-17C neutralizing antibody attenuated acute kidney injury (AKI, a common acute inflammation associated renal disease). In this study, we explored whether post-ischemia reperfusion (IR) of IL-17C blockade has therapeutic effects on AKI and whether IL-17C is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN), a major type of chronic inflammation-associated kidney disease.<h4>Methods</h4>12-week-old male C57BL/6JGpt mice were treated with IL-17C neutralizing antibody or normal IgG control antibody at 3 h after reperfusion. Renal injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed. Additionally, we examined renal IL-17C expression in patients with DN and db/db mice and evaluated albuminuria, mesangial matrix accumulation and podocyte loss in db/db mice with IL-17C neutralization. Knockdown of NF-κB p65 using siRNA, and blocking Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) using YC-1 in mice and HIF-1α Decoy in HK2 cells were investigated to explore the possible signaling pathway involved in IL-17C regulation.<h4>Findings</h4>We found that delayed IL-17C neutralization had similar reno-protective effects on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Additionally, renal IL-17C expression was increased in patients with DN and db/db mice, while IL-17C blockade significantly attenuated DN, accompanied with blunted albuminuria, mesangial matrix accumulation, and podocyte loss. Moreover, IL-17C neutralization significantly repressed the expression of downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory cell infiltration, and Th17/IL-17A activation both in mice with renal IRI and DN. Mechanistical studies demonstrated that hypoxia or high glucose-induced IL-17C up-regulation was predominantly mediated by NF-κB pathway.<h4>Interpretation</h4>IL-17C participates in the pathogenesis of AKI and DN and inhibition of IL-17C shows potential as a therapeutic strategy for AKI and DN.<h4>Funding</h4>The National Natural Science Foundation of China (81770741, 81700601 and 81870504).","<h4>Background</h4>Interleukin-17C (IL-17C), a member of the IL-17 cytokine family, plays a pathogenic role in kidney diseases.

Though several chemical measures are available to manage crop diseases, many of them have serious side effects on humans, animals and the environment. Therefore, the use of such chemicals must be limited by using effective and eco-friendly alternatives. In view of the same, we found a <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> BS-58 as a good antagonist towards the two most devastating phytopathogens, i.e., <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> and <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>. Both the pathogens attack several agricultural crops (including <i>amaranth</i>) and induce a variety of infections in them. The findings of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in this study suggested that <i>B. subtilis</i> BS-58 could inhibit the growth of both the pathogenic fungi by various means such as perforation, cell wall lysis, and cytoplasmic disintegration in the fungal hyphae. Thin-layer chromatography, LC-MS and FT-IR data revealed the antifungal metabolite to be macrolactin A with a molecular weight of 402 Da. Presence of the <i>mln</i> gene in the bacterial genome further endorsed that the antifungal metabolite produced by BS-58 was macrolactin A. Pot trial conducted in the present study showed that seed treatment by BS-58 effectively reduced seedling mortality (54.00 and 43.76%) in <i>amaranth</i>, when grown in pathogen infested soil (<i>F. oxysporum</i> and <i>R. solani</i>, respectively), when compared to their respective negative controls.

Primarily, genetically modified (GM) crops expressing double-stranded (ds)RNA-mediating gene silencing of foreign transcripts have been developed. However, since the cultivation of GM RNAi crops is viewed negatively in numerous countries, GM-free exogenous RNA spray applications attract tremendous scientific and political interest. The sudden rise in demand for pesticide alternatives has boosted research on sprayable RNA biopesticides, generating significant technological developments and advancing the potential for field applications in the near future. Here we review the latest advances that could pave the way for a quick lab-to-field transition for RNA sprays, which, as safe, selective, broadly applicable, and cost-effective biopesticides, represent an innovation in sustainable crop production. Given these latest advances, we further discuss technological limitations, knowledge gaps in the research, safety concerns and regulatory requirements that need to be considered and addressed before RNA sprays can become a reliable and realistic agricultural approach.","The drastic loss of biodiversity has alarmed the public and raised sociopolitical demand for chemical pesticide-free plant production, which is now treated by governments worldwide as a top priority.

Results show that the parasitoid resumed its development to the adult stage at normal rearing conditions (22 °C, 100% RH, 14L:10D) after 6- or 7-months cold chilling at both the semi-natural and laboratory conditions. It had a low survival rate (36.7%) on potted plants due to desiccation or tree wound defense response. No parasitoids survived at 44% RH, but survival rate increased with humidity, reaching the highest (93.7%) at 100% RH. Survival rate also increased from 21.0% at 2 °C to 82.8% at 12.5 °C. Post-diapause developmental time decreased with increased humidity or temperature. There was no difference in the lifetime fecundity of emerged females from 2 and 12.5 °C. These results suggest that 100% RH and 12.5 °C are the most suitable diapause conditions for laboratory rearing of this parasitoid.","<i>Aprostocetus fukutai</i> is a specialist egg parasitoid of the citrus longhorned beetle <i>Anoplophora chinensis</i>, a high-risk invasive pest of hardwood trees.

10.1016/j.jbc.2024.107147,Restricted glycolysis is a primary cause of the reduced growth rate of zinc-deficient yeast cells.,"Zinc is required for many critical processes, including intermediary metabolism. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Zap1 activator regulates the transcription of ∼80 genes in response to Zn supply. Some Zap1-regulated genes are Zn transporters that maintain Zn homeostasis, while others mediate adaptive responses that enhance fitness. One adaptive response gene encodes the 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin Tsa1, which is critical to Zn-deficient (ZnD) growth. Depending on its redox state, Tsa1 can function as a peroxidase, a protein chaperone, or a regulatory redox sensor. In a screen for possible Tsa1 regulatory targets, we identified a mutation (cdc19<sup>S492A</sup>) that partially suppressed the tsa1Δ growth defect. The cdc19<sup>S492A</sup> mutation reduced activity of its protein product, pyruvate kinase isozyme 1 (Pyk1), implicating Tsa1 in adapting glycolysis to ZnD conditions. Glycolysis requires activity of the Zn-dependent enzyme fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 1, which was substantially decreased in ZnD cells. We hypothesized that in ZnD tsa1Δ cells, the loss of a compensatory Tsa1 regulatory function causes depletion of glycolytic intermediates and restricts dependent amino acid synthesis pathways, and that the decreased activity of Pyk1<sup>S492A</sup> counteracted this depletion by slowing the irreversible conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. In support of this model, supplementing ZnD tsa1Δ cells with aromatic amino acids improved their growth. Phosphoenolpyruvate supplementation, in contrast, had a much greater effect on growth rate of WT and tsa1Δ ZnD cells, indicating that inefficient glycolysis is a major factor limiting yeast growth. Surprisingly however, this restriction was not primarily due to low fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 1 activity, but instead occurs earlier in glycolysis.","Zinc is required for many critical processes, including intermediary metabolism.

Recent studies demonstrated that certain infections induce innate immune memory (also termed trained immunity), especially in macrophages, to respond more strongly to future stimuli with broad specificity, involving in human inflammatory diseases. Metabolic reprogramming increases the capacity of the innate immune cells to respond to a secondary stimulation, is a crucial step for the induction of trained immunity. We hypothesize that specific metabolic reprogramming of lung trained macrophages induced by neonatal respiratory infection is crucial for childhood allergic asthma.<h4>Objective</h4>To address the role of metabolic reprogramming in lung trained macrophages induced by respiratory virus infection in allergic asthma.<h4>Methods</h4>Neonatal mice were infected and sensitized by the natural rodent pathogen Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), a mouse equivalent strain of human RSV, combined with ovalbumin (OVA). Lung CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the memory phase were re-stimulated to investigate trained immunity and metabonomics. Adoptive transfer, metabolic inhibitor and restore experiments were used to explore the role of specific metabolic reprogramming in childhood allergic asthma.<h4>Results</h4>PVM infection combined with OVA sensitization in neonatal mice resulted in non-Th2 (Th1/Th17) type allergic asthma following OVA challenge in childhood of mice. Lung CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the memory phage increased, and showed enhanced inflammatory responses following re-stimulation, suggesting trained macrophages. Adoptive transfer of the trained macrophages mediated the allergic asthma in childhood. The trained macrophages showed metabolic reprogramming after re-stimulation. Notably, proline biosynthesis remarkably increased. Inhibition of proline biosynthesis suppressed the development of the trained macrophages as well as the Th1/Th17 type allergic asthma, while supplement of proline recovered the trained macrophages as well as the allergic asthma.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Proline metabolism reprogramming of trained macrophages induced by early respiratory infection combined with allergen sensitization contributes to development of allergic asthma in childhood. Proline metabolism could be a well target for prevention of allergic asthma in childhood.","<h4>Background</h4>Infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated bronchiolitis are at increased risk of childhood asthma.

The best way to treat the condition is unclear.<h4>Objectives</h4>We assessed evidence in three areas of equipoise. 1. Induction. To compare efficacy and safety of initial therapy with liposomal amphotericin B versus initial therapy with alternative antifungals. 2. Maintenance. To compare efficacy and safety of maintenance therapy with 12 months of oral antifungal treatment with shorter durations of maintenance therapy. 3. Antiretroviral therapy (ART). To compare the outcomes of early initiation versus delayed initiation of ART.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane CENTRAL; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (Ovid); Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, and BIOSIS Previews (all three in the Web of Science); the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the ISRCTN registry, all up to 20 March 2020.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We evaluated studies assessing the use of liposomal amphotericin B and alternative antifungals for induction therapy; studies assessing the duration of antifungals for maintenance therapy; and studies assessing the timing of ART. We included randomized controlled trials (RCT), single-arm trials, prospective cohort studies, and single-arm cohort studies.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors assessed eligibility and risk of bias, extracted data, and assessed certainty of evidence. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess risk of bias in randomized studies, and ROBINS-I tool to assess risk of bias in non-randomized studies. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RRs), with 95% confidence intervals (CI).<h4>Main results</h4>We identified 17 individual studies. We judged eight studies to be at critical risk of bias, and removed these from the analysis. 1. Induction We found one RCT which compared liposomal amphotericin B to deoxycholate amphotericin B. Compared to deoxycholate amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B may have higher clinical success rates (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.11; 1 study, 80 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to deoxycholate amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B has lower rates of nephrotoxicity (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 study, 77 participants; high-certainty evidence). We found very low-certainty evidence to inform comparisons between amphotericin B formulations and azoles for induction therapy. 2. Maintenance We found no eligible study that compared less than 12 months of oral antifungal treatment to 12 months or greater for maintenance therapy. For both induction and maintenance, fluconazole performed poorly in comparison to other azoles. 3. ART We found one study, in which one out of seven participants in the 'early' arm and none of the three participants in the 'late' arm died.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Liposomal amphotericin B appears to be a better choice compared to deoxycholate amphotericin B for treating PDH in people with HIV; and fluconazole performed poorly compared to other azoles. Other treatment choices for induction, maintenance, and when to start ART have no evidence, or very low certainty evidence.

By contrast, infection by opportunistic fungi does not depend on vectors, although damage caused by an herbivore may facilitate infection. Manipulation of hosts and vectors, such as insect herbivores, has not been demonstrated in interactions with fungal pathogens. Herein, we establish a new paradigm for the plant-insect-fungus association in sugarcane. It has long been assumed that Fusarium verticillioides is an opportunistic fungus, where it takes advantage of the openings left by Diatraea saccharalis caterpillar attack to infect the plant. In this work, we show that volatile emissions from F. verticillioides attract D. saccharalis caterpillars. Once they become adults, the fungus is transmitted vertically to their offspring, which continues the cycle by inoculating the fungus into healthy plants. Females not carrying the fungus prefer to lay their eggs on fungus-infected plants than mock plants, while females carrying the fungus prefer to lay their eggs on mock plants than fungus-infected plants. Even though the fungus impacts D. saccharalis sex behavior, larval weight and reproduction rate, most individuals complete their development. Our data demonstrate that the fungus manipulates both the host plant and insect herbivore across life cycle to promote its infection and dissemination.","Vector-borne plant pathogens often change host traits to manipulate vector behavior in a way that favors their spread.

To potentiate the treatment of <i>C. albicans</i>-induced VVC by an alternative method as photodynamic therapy (PDT), hypericin (Hy), a potent photosensitizer compound was incorporated into a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) and dispersed in hydrogel (HG).<h4>Methods</h4>After preparation of the sonication process, an NLC loaded with Hy was dispersed in HG based on Poloxamer 407 and chitosan obtaining Hy.NLC-HG. This hydrogel system was physically and chemically characterized and its in vitro and in vivo photodynamic and antifungal effects were evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>Through scanning electron microscopy, it was possible to observe a hydrogel system with a porous polymeric matrix and irregular microcavities.

To potentiate the treatment of <i>C. albicans</i>-induced VVC by an alternative method as photodynamic therapy (PDT), hypericin (Hy), a potent photosensitizer compound was incorporated into a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) and dispersed in hydrogel (HG).<h4>Methods</h4>After preparation of the sonication process, an NLC loaded with Hy was dispersed in HG based on Poloxamer 407 and chitosan obtaining Hy.NLC-HG. This hydrogel system was physically and chemically characterized and its in vitro and in vivo photodynamic and antifungal effects were evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>Through scanning electron microscopy, it was possible to observe a hydrogel system with a porous polymeric matrix and irregular microcavities. The Hy.NLC-HG system showed mucoadhesive properties (0.45 ± 0.08 N) and a satisfactory injectability (15.74 ± 4.75 N.mm), which indicates that it can be easily applied in the vaginal canal, in addition to a controlled and sustained Hy release profile from the NLC-HG of 28.55 ± 0.15% after 720 min.

Recent advancements in genetic engineering can facilitate the development of entomopathogenic fungi with desired traits to enhance biocontrol efficacy. In this study, a CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein system was utilized to genetically improve the virulence of Beauveria bassiana, a broad-spectrum insect pathogen used in biocontrol of arthropod pests worldwide. CRISPR-Cas9-based disruption of the transcription factor-encoding gene Bbsmr1 led to derepression of the oosporein biosynthetic gene cluster resulting in overproduction of the red-pigmented dibenzoquinone oosporein involved in host immune evasion, thus increasing fungal virulence. Mutants defective for Bbsmr1 displayed a remarkable enhanced insecticidal activity by reducing lethal times and concentrations, while concomitantly presenting negligible or minor pleiotropic effects. In addition, these mutants displayed faster germination on the insect cuticle which correlated with higher density of free-floating blastospores in the hemolymph and accelerated mortality of the host. These findings emphasize the utility of genetic engineering in developing enhanced fungal biocontrol agents with customized phenotypic traits, and provide an efficient and versatile genetic transformation tool for application in other beneficial entomopathogenic fungi.","Biocontrol agents play a pivotal role in managing pests and contribute to sustainable agriculture.

10.1007/s00442-020-04697-7,Possible control of acute outbreaks of a marine fungal pathogen by nominally herbivorous tropical reef fish.,"Primary producers in terrestrial and marine systems can be affected by fungal pathogens threatening the provision of critical ecosystem services. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are ecologically important members of tropical reef systems and are impacted by coralline fungal disease (CFD) which manifests as overgrowth of the CCA crust by fungal lesions causing partial to complete mortality of the CCA host. No natural controls for CFD have been identified, but nominally herbivorous fish could play a role by consuming pathogenic fungi. We documented preferential grazing on fungal lesions by adults of six common reef-dwelling species of herbivorous Acanthuridae and Labridae, (surgeonfish and parrotfish) which collectively demonstrated an ~ 80-fold higher grazing rate on fungal lesions relative to their proportionate benthic coverage, and a preference for lesions over other palatable substrata (e.g. live scleractinian coral, CCA, or algae). Furthermore, we recorded a ~ 600% increase in live CFD lesion size over an approximately 2-week period when grazing by herbivorous fish was experimentally excluded suggesting that herbivorous reef fish could control CFD progression by directly reducing biomass of the fungal pathogen. Removal rates may be sufficient to allow CCA to recover from infection and explain historically observed natural waning behaviour after an outbreak. Thus, in addition to their well-known role as determinants of macroalgal overgrowth of reefs, herbivorous fish could thus also be important in control of diseases affecting crustose coralline algae that stabilize the foundation of coral reef substrata.","Primary producers in terrestrial and marine systems can be affected by fungal pathogens threatening the provision of critical ecosystem services.

Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in priming T-cell-mediated immune reactions through the antigen-presenting function. Combining immunotherapy and radiation therapy may generate more substantial anti-cancer efficacy through immunomodulation.<h4>Objectives</h4>Our research reported a preliminary result of the safety and outcome of a kind of immunotherapy, the allogeneic dendritic cell and autologous tumor cell fusion vaccine, alone or in combination with hypofractionated radiation therapy, in canine oral malignant melanoma.<h4>Methods</h4>Two groups of dogs with histopathological diagnoses of oral malignant melanoma were recruited. In group 1 (DCRT), dogs received a combination of DC fusion vaccine and radiotherapy. In group 2 (DC), dogs received DC fusion vaccine alone. DC vaccination was given once every 2 weeks for four doses. Radiotherapy was performed weekly for five fractions. Dogs that received carboplatin were retrospectively collected as a control group (group 3).<h4>Results</h4>Five dogs were included in group 1 (two stage II, three stage III), 11 in group 2 (three stage I/II, eight stage III/IV), and eight (two stage I/II, six stage III/IV) in the control group. Both DC and DCRT were well-tolerated, with only mild adverse events reported, including mucositis, gastrointestinal discomfort, and injection site reactions. The median progression-free intervals in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 214 (95% CI, NA, due to insufficient data), 100 (95% CI, 27-237), and 42 days (95% CI, NA-170), respectively, which were not significantly different. The 1-year survival rates were 20, 54.5, and 12.5% in groups 1, 2, and 3. Dogs in the DCRT group exhibited significantly higher TGF-β signals than the DC group throughout the treatment course, indicating a possible higher degree of immunosuppression.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The manuscript demonstrated the safety of dendritic cell/tumor cell fusion vaccine immunotherapy, alone or in combination with radiotherapy. The results support further expansion of this immunotherapy, modification of combination treatment and protocols, and investigation of combining DC vaccine with other treatment modalities.<h4>Clinical trial registration</h4>Preclinical Trials, PCTE0000475.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Immunotherapy represents a promising breakthrough in cancer management and is being explored in canine melanomas.

10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102068,Structural characterization of fungus-specific histone deacetylase Hos3 provides insights into developing selective inhibitors with antifungal activity.,"Fungal infection has long been a chronic and even life-threatening problem for humans. The demand for new antifungal drugs has increased dramatically as fungal infections have continued to increase, yet no new classes of drugs have been approved for nearly 15 years due to either high toxicity or development of drug resistance. Thus, validating new drug targets, especially fungus-specific targets, may facilitate future drug design. Here, we report the crystal structure of yeast Hos3 (ScHos3), a fungus-specific histone deacetylase (HDAC) that plays an important role in the life span of fungi. As acetylation modifications are important to many aspects of fungal infection, the species specificity of Hos3 makes it an ideal target for the development of new antifungal drugs. In this study, we show that ScHos3 forms a functional homodimer in solution, and key residues for dimerization crucial for its deacetylation activity were identified. We used molecular dynamics simulation and structural comparison with mammalian hHDAC6 to determine unique features of the ScHos3 catalytic core. In addition, a small-molecule inhibitor with a preference for ScHos3 was identified through structure-based virtual screening and in vitro enzymatic assays. The structural information and regulatory interferences of ScHos3 reported here provide new insights for the design of selective inhibitors that target fungal HDAC with high efficiency and low toxicity or that have the potential to overcome the prevailing problem of drug resistance in combination therapy with other drugs.","Fungal infection has long been a chronic and even life-threatening problem for humans.

It has long been speculated that these colonization events are assisted by waterbirds, transporting fish eggs attached to their feet and feathers, yet empirical support for this is lacking. Recently, it was suggested that endozoochory (i.e., internal transport within the gut) might play a more important role, but only highly resistant diapause eggs of killifish have been found to survive passage through waterbird guts. Here, we performed a controlled feeding experiment, where developing eggs of two cosmopolitan, invasive cyprinids (common carp, Prussian carp) were fed to captive mallards. Live embryos of both species were retrieved from fresh feces and survived beyond hatching. Our study identifies an overlooked dispersal mechanism in fish, providing evidence for bird-mediated dispersal ability of soft-membraned eggs undergoing active development. Only 0.2% of ingested eggs survived gut passage, yet, given the abundance, diet, and movements of ducks in nature, our results have major implications for biodiversity conservation and invasion dynamics in freshwater ecosystems.","Fish have somehow colonized isolated water bodies all over the world without human assistance.

The use of the phenomenon of local defect resonance (LDR) allows intensifying vibrations in defect zones, which can reliably be detected by means of laser vibrometry. The resonance acoustic stimulation of structural defects in materials causes compression/tension deformations, which are essentially lower than the material tensile strength, thus proving a nondestructive character of the LDR technique. In this study, the propagation of elastic waves in composites and their interaction with structural inhomogeneities were analyzed by performing 3D scanning of vibrations in Fast Fourier Transform mode. At each scanning point, the in-plane (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) and out of plane (<i>z</i>) vibration components were analyzed. The acoustic stimulation was fulfilled by generating a frequency-modulated harmonic signal in the range from 50 Hz to 100 kHz. In the case of a reference plate with a flat bottom hole, the resonance frequencies for all (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>) components were identical. In the case of impact damage in a carbon fiber reinforced plastic sample, the predominant contribution into total vibrations was provided by compression/tension deformations (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i> vibration component) to compare with vibrations by the <i>z</i> coordinate.

Despite the efficacy of synthetic fungicides, their health and environmental hazards have highlighted the urgent need for safer alternatives, such as phytochemical-based biocides. Owing to the upregulation of the plant secondary metabolism under stressful conditions, bioprospecting in harsh environments could reveal ore plants for bioactive metabolites. In this study, thirteen wild plants were collected from their natural habitat in a semiarid environment (Yanbu, Saudi Arabia) and extracted to obtain phenolics rich extracts. Total polyphenols, flavonoids, antioxidant capacities and the antifungal activities of the extracts against a pathogenic isolate of F. solani were assessed. Fusarium solani was isolated from infected zucchini and characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the phytochemical screening and in vitro bioactivity revealed that Rosmarinus officinalis, Pulicaria crispa, Achillea falcata and Haloxylon salicornicum were the richest in polyphenols and the most powerful against F. solani. Further, the extracts of these four plants significantly decreased the disease incidence in zucchini, where P. crispa was the premier.

10.3390/biomedicines10102448,Dual Role of Extracellular Vesicles in Sepsis-Associated Kidney and Lung Injury.,"Extracellular vesicles form a complex intercellular communication network, shuttling a variety of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, including regulatory RNAs, such as microRNAs. Transfer of these molecules to target cells allows for the modulation of sets of genes and mediates multiple paracrine and endocrine actions. EVs exert broad pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant, and pro-apoptotic effects in sepsis, mediating microvascular dysfunction and multiple organ damage. This deleterious role is well documented in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. On the other hand, protective effects of stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles have been reported in experimental models of sepsis. Stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles recapitulate beneficial cytoprotective, regenerative, and immunomodulatory properties of parental cells and have shown therapeutic effects in experimental models of sepsis with kidney and lung involvement. Extracellular vesicles are also likely to play a role in deranged kidney-lung crosstalk, a hallmark of sepsis, and may be key to a better understanding of shared mechanisms underlying multiple organ dysfunction. In this review, we analyze the state-of-the-art knowledge on the dual role of EVs in sepsis-associated kidney/lung injury and repair. PubMed library was searched from inception to July 2022, using a combination of medical subject headings (MeSH) and keywords related to EVs, sepsis, acute kidney injury (AKI), acute lung injury (ALI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Key findings are summarized into two sections on detrimental and beneficial mechanisms of actions of EVs in kidney and lung injury, respectively. The role of EVs in kidney-lung crosstalk is then outlined. Efforts to expand knowledge on EVs may pave the way to employ them as prognostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets to prevent or reduce organ damage in sepsis.","Extracellular vesicles form a complex intercellular communication network, shuttling a variety of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, including regulatory RNAs, such as microRNAs.

10.1038/s41598-022-20377-3,Quantifying wood decomposition by insects and fungi using computed tomography scanning and machine learning.,"Wood decomposition is a central process contributing to global carbon and nutrient cycling. Quantifying the role of the major biotic agents of wood decomposition, i.e. insects and fungi, is thus important for a better understanding of this process. Methods to quantify wood decomposition, such as dry mass loss, suffer from several shortcomings, such as destructive sampling or subsampling. We developed and tested a new approach based on computed tomography (CT) scanning and semi-automatic image analysis of logs from a field experiment with manipulated beetle communities. We quantified the volume of beetle tunnels in wood and bark and the relative wood volume showing signs of fungal decay and compared both measures to classic approaches. The volume of beetle tunnels was correlated with dry mass loss and clearly reflected the differences between beetle functional groups. Fungal decay was identified with high accuracy and strongly correlated with ergosterol content. Our data show that this is a powerful approach to quantify wood decomposition by insects and fungi. In contrast to other methods, it is non-destructive, covers entire deadwood objects and provides spatially explicit information opening a wide range of research options. For the development of general models, we urge researchers to publish training data.","Wood decomposition is a central process contributing to global carbon and nutrient cycling.

10.3390/microorganisms10020206,Effect of AM Fungi Inoculation on Litter Bacterial Community Characteristics under Heavy Metal Stress.,"Because microorganisms are the primary driving force behind litter decomposition, they play an important role in maintaining ecosystem material and chemical cycling. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can improve host plant tolerance to various environmental stressors, making their application in mining area remediation important. In this study, litter from the dominant plant species (<i>Imperata cylindrica</i>) in a copper tailings mining area was selected as the experimental material. We conducted a greenhouse-based heavy metal stress experiment to investigate how AM fungi affect litter microbial community characteristics and key ecological factors. Results showed that AM fungi species, heavy metal treatments, and their combined interaction had significant impacts on litter pH. Additionally, enzyme activities in litter were significantly affected by interactions between AM fungi species and heavy metal contaminates. <i>Ralstonia</i> was significantly positively correlated to lead (Pb) content, indicating that <i>Ralstonia</i> had a certain tolerance to Pb pollution. Sucrase and urease activity were increased when plants were inoculated with <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> under Pb stress. Furthermore, <i>Microbacterium</i>, <i>Brevundimonas</i>, and <i>Pseudonocardia</i> all may play important roles in litter decomposition, while a certain tolerance was observed in <i>Kushneria</i> and <i>Roseivivax</i> to heavy metal pollution when plants were inoculated with <i>Glomus mosseae</i>. Results showed that AM fungi affected litter bacterial community structure and function by influencing plant litter properties. By exploring interactions between AM fungi and bacterial communities in plant litter under heavy metal stress, we will better understand associative processes that promote the cycling of soil organic matter and nutrients contaminated by non-ferrous metal tailings.","Because microorganisms are the primary driving force behind litter decomposition, they play an important role in maintaining ecosystem material and chemical cycling.

10.3390/pharmaceutics12121161,A Critical Review on Emerging Trends in Dry Powder Inhaler Formulation for the Treatment of Pulmonary Aspergillosis.,"Pulmonary aspergillosis (PA), a pulmonary fungal infection caused by <i>Aspergillus</i> spp., is a concern for immunocompromised populations. Despite substantial research efforts, conventional treatments of PA using antifungal agents are associated with limitations such as excessive systemic exposure, serious side effects and limited availability of the therapeutics in the lungs for an adequate duration. To overcome the limitations associated with the conventional regimens, pulmonary delivery of antifungal agents has become a focal point of research because of the superiority of local and targeted drug delivery. Dry powder inhalers and nebulized formulations of antifungal agents have been developed and evaluated for their capability to effectively deliver antifungal agents to the lungs. Moreover, progress in nanotechnology and the utilization of nanocarriers in the development of pulmonary delivery formulations has allowed further augmentation of treatment capability and efficiency. Thus, the following review provides an insight into the advantages and therapeutic potential of the utilization of nanocarriers in pulmonary delivery of antifungal agents for the treatment of PA. In addition, discussions on formulation aspects and safety concerns together with the clinical and regulatory aspects of the formulations are presented, which suggest the possibility and desirability of utilization of nanocarriers in the treatment of PA.","Pulmonary aspergillosis (PA), a pulmonary fungal infection caused by <i>Aspergillus</i> spp., is a concern for immunocompromised populations.

Cases that occur in nonendemic regions of the world are imported through migration and travel. Due to the limited number of cases in Europe, most physicians are not familiar with paracoccidioidomycosis and its close clinical and histopathological resemblance to other infectious and noninfectious disease. To increase awareness of this insidious mycosis, we conducted a systematic review to summarize the evidence on cases diagnosed and reported in Europe. We searched PubMed and Embase to identify cases of paracoccidioidomycosis diagnosed in European countries. In addition, we used Scopus for citation tracking and manually screened bibliographies of relevant articles. We conducted dual abstract and full-text screening of references yielded by our searches. To identify publications published prior to 1985, we used the previously published review by Ajello et al. Overall, we identified 83 cases of paracoccidioidomycosis diagnosed in 11 European countries, published in 68 articles. Age of patients ranged from 24 to 77 years; the majority were male. Time from leaving the endemic region and first occurrence of symptoms considerably varied. Our review illustrates the challenges of considering systemic mycosis in the differential diagnosis of people returning or immigrating to Europe from endemic areas. Travel history is important for diagnostic-workup, though it might be difficult to obtain due to possible long latency period of the disease.","Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic mycosis that is endemic in geographical regions of Central and South America.

She had a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. On further investigation, using diagnostic and Interventional aids, a final diagnosis of maxillary fungal osteomyelitis was made. The infective fungal agents were a mixture of <i>Mucorales</i> and <i>Aspergillus</i> species. A review of all literatures on the subject in the past 13 years using different search engines showed that craniofacial fungal infections with primary maxillary involvement are a rare phenomenon. The primary aim of reporting this case, therefore, is to highlight its rarity, presentation, management and most importantly the outcome of management.","Fungal osteomyelitis is a life-threatening and seldom seen opportunistic infection.

A new lung CT image segmentation algorithm (U-Net+ deep convolution (DC)) was proposed based on U-Net network and compared with convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm. Then, it was applied to CT image diagnosis of 100 patients with severe lung infection in The Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University hospital and compared with traditional methods, and its sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were compared. It was found that the single training time and loss of U-Net + DC algorithm were reduced by 59.4% and 9.8%, respectively, compared with CNN algorithm, while Dice increased by 3.6%. The lung contour segmented by the proposed model was smooth, which was the closest to the gold standard. Fungal infection, bacterial infection, viral infection, tuberculosis infection, and mixed infection accounted for 28%, 18%, 7%, 7%, and 40%, respectively. 36%, 38%, 26%, 17%, and 20% of the patients had ground-glass shadow, solid shadow, nodule or mass shadow, reticular or linear shadow, and hollow shadow in CT, respectively. The incidence of various CT characteristics in patients with fungal and bacterial infections was statistically significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The specificity (94.32%) and accuracy (97.22%) of CT image diagnosis based on U-Net + DC algorithm were significantly higher than traditional diagnostic method (75.74% and 74.23%), and the differences were statistically significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The network of the algorithm in this study demonstrated excellent image segmentation effect.

The optimal antifungal treatment for <i>Aspergillus</i> osteomyelitis, including FRI, has not been established yet, as only cases have been documented and data on bone penetration of antifungal drugs are scarce. We describe a patient with <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> FRI of the tibia who was treated with isavuconazole after developing liver function disturbances during voriconazole therapy. Isavuconazole, the active moiety formed after hydrolysis of the prodrug isavuconazonium sulfate by plasma esterases, was administered in a maintenance dose of 200 mg q24 h, followed by 150 mg q24 h. The patient completed a six-month antifungal treatment course. Although fracture union was not achieved during six months of follow-up after therapy cessation, no confirmatory signs of FRI were observed. Additionally, two literature searches were conducted to review available data on antifungal treatment of <i>Aspergillus</i> osteomyelitis and bone penetration of antifungals. One hundred and eight cases of <i>Aspergillus</i> osteomyelitis, including six (5.6%) FRI cases, were identified.

Thus, the need for alternative formulations/route of administration for amphotericin B remains crucial.

Cellular phagocytosis of submicron particles can be used to courier encapsulated drugs. In this regard, nanoparticulate delivery systems have received much attention in the past decade. This review examines the trajectory of orally delivered amphotericin B and discusses key physical factors of nanoformulations that impact bioavailability.

The investigations are a continuation of experiments on the antitumor activity of coelomic fluid obtained from this species. The Venetin-1 nanoparticle was obtained after thermal treatment of the coelomic fluid, separation from coelomocytes, filtration, and lyophilization. The preparation showed a selective effect on cancer cells, whereas normal cells were unaffected. Venetin-1 was effective against the lung cancer cells at doses of 31.3 and 62.5 µg/ml, and the results were imaged using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The cells died mainly via the apoptosis pathway. Necrotic cells appeared sporadically in the microscopic view. SEM imaging revealed complete destruction of the A549 cells after the incubation with Venetin-1. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses showed changes in the topography, peak force error images, and Young's modulus (elasticity) of the A549 cells after the incubation with Venetin-1. The transmission electron cryomicroscopy (Cryo-TEM) analysis indicated a polymeric nature of the analyzed preparation. The samples of Venetin-1 showed a very homogeneous size profile with the microparticle size of approximately 58.23 nm. A significant decrease in Venetin-1 binding to sphingomyelin was observed. Venetin-1 lost its pore-forming activity or deactivation of the pore-forming activity occurred. This confirms the absence of hemolytic capacity of Venetin-1 towards red blood cells. The conducted analyses show the suitability of the obtained complex for biomedical research. The next step will consist in analyses of the effect of Venetin-1 on the immune system in mice.","The present research shows the antitumor activity of a protein-polysaccharide complex Venetin-1 obtained from the coelomic fluid of Dendrobaena veneta earthworms against A549 cancer cells.

The conducted analyses show the suitability of the obtained complex for biomedical research. The next step will consist in analyses of the effect of Venetin-1 on the immune system in mice.",EuropePMC

Phenotypic and genotypic differences have been associated with their geographic distribution, virulence, or clinical manifestation of sporotrichosis. In the past decade, the interest in identifying species of the <i>Sporothrix</i> sp. has been increasing, due to its epidemiological importance and, in consequence, is important to know how to preserve them for future studies, in culture collection.<h4>Aims</h4>The purposes of this study were to analyze the global distribution of environmental isolates and/or causal agents of sporotrichosis identified by polyphasic taxonomy, with mandatory use of molecular identification, and to evaluate the percentages and distribution of isolates stored in culture collections.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review of articles on animal and human sporotrichosis and/or environmental isolation of the fungus, from 2007 to 2023, was done. Results: Our results demonstrated that, <i>S. globosa</i>, <i>S. schenckii</i>, and <i>S. brasiliensis</i> were the most identified species.

The results showed that: (1) the rice seedling biomass of the AMF compound inoculant treatment group was significantly higher than that of the non-inoculation treatment group (P < 0.05); (2) under NaCl stress, inoculation with AMF compound inoculants can activate the rice antioxidant enzyme system and improve osmoregulation ability; (3) AMF compound inoculants can increase the concentration of K<sup>+</sup> in the plant and inhibit the transfer of Na<sup>+</sup> to rice leaves, maintaining a high K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup>; and (4) AMF compound inoculants could induce and regulate the overexpression of genes related to salt tolerance, photosynthesis and ion homeostasis in rice, and improve the tolerance of rice under salt stress.

In the present study, 55 maize inbred lines with Sipingtou blood were inoculated with <i>S. reilianum</i> and classified into three tassel symptom types (A, B, and C). Three maize inbred lines representing these classes (Huangzao4, Jing7, and Chang7-2, respectively) were used as test materials to investigate the physiological mechanisms of tassel formation in infected plants. Changes in enzyme activity, hormone content, and protein expression were analyzed in all three lines after infection and in control plants. The activities of peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and phenylalanine-ammonia-lyase (PAL) were increased in the three typical inbred lines after inoculation. POD and SOD activities showed similar trends between lines, with the increase percentage peaking at the V12 stage (POD: 57.06%, 63.19%, and 70.28% increases in Huangzao4, Jing7, and Chang7-2, respectively; SOD: 27.01%, 29.62%, and 47.07% in Huangzao4, Jing7, and Chang7-2, respectively. These were all higher than in the disease-resistant inbred line Mo17 at the same growth stage); this stage was found to be key in tassel symptom formation. Levels of gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and abscisic acid (ABA) were also altered in the three typical maize inbred lines after inoculation, with changes in GA<sub>3</sub> and IAA contents tightly correlated with tassel symptoms after <i>S. reilianum</i> infection. The differentially expressed proteins A5H8G4, P09233, and Q8VXG7 were associated with changes in enzyme activity, whereas P49353, P13689, and P10979 were associated with changes in hormone contents. Fungal infection caused reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) bursts in the three typical inbred lines.

10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102455,Pore-forming moss protein bryoporin is structurally and mechanistically related to actinoporins from evolutionarily distant cnidarians.,"Pore-forming proteins perforate lipid membranes and consequently affect their integrity and cell fitness. Therefore, it is not surprising that many of these proteins from bacteria, fungi, or certain animals act as toxins. While pore-forming proteins have also been found in plants, there is little information about their molecular structure and mode of action. Bryoporin is a protein from the moss Physcomitrium patens, and its corresponding gene was found to be upregulated by various abiotic stresses, especially dehydration, as well as upon fungal infection. Based on the amino acid sequence, it was suggested that bryoporin was related to the actinoporin family of pore-forming proteins, originally discovered in sea anemones. Here, we provide the first detailed structural and functional analysis of this plant cytolysin. The crystal structure of monomeric bryoporin is highly similar to those of actinoporins. Our cryo-EM analysis of its pores showed an actinoporin-like octameric structure, thereby revealing a close kinship of proteins from evolutionarily distant organisms. This was further confirmed by our observation of bryoporin's preferential binding to and formation of pores in membranes containing animal sphingolipids, such as sphingomyelin and ceramide phosphoethanolamine; however, its binding affinity was weaker than that of actinoporin equinatoxin II. We determined bryoporin did not bind to major sphingolipids found in fungi or plants, and its membrane-binding and pore-forming activity was enhanced by various sterols. Our results suggest that bryoporin could represent a part of the moss defense arsenal, acting as a pore-forming toxin against membranes of potential animal pathogens, parasites, or predators.","Pore-forming proteins perforate lipid membranes and consequently affect their integrity and cell fitness.

Based on the amino acid sequence, it was suggested that bryoporin was related to the actinoporin family of pore-forming proteins, originally discovered in sea anemones. Here, we provide the first detailed structural and functional analysis of this plant cytolysin. The crystal structure of monomeric bryoporin is highly similar to those of actinoporins. Our cryo-EM analysis of its pores showed an actinoporin-like octameric structure, thereby revealing a close kinship of proteins from evolutionarily distant organisms. This was further confirmed by our observation of bryoporin's preferential binding to and formation of pores in membranes containing animal sphingolipids, such as sphingomyelin and ceramide phosphoethanolamine; however, its binding affinity was weaker than that of actinoporin equinatoxin II. We determined bryoporin did not bind to major sphingolipids found in fungi or plants, and its membrane-binding and pore-forming activity was enhanced by various sterols. Our results suggest that bryoporin could represent a part of the moss defense arsenal, acting as a pore-forming toxin against membranes of potential animal pathogens, parasites, or predators.",EuropePMC

In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of rapid microbial identification by MALDI-TOF MS with and without AST on clinical outcomes. We searched PubMed and EMBASE databases from inception to 1 February 2022 to identify pre-post and parallel comparative studies that evaluated the use of MALDI-TOF MS for microorganism identification. Pooled effect estimates were derived using the random-effects model. Twenty-one studies with 14,515 patients were meta-analysed.

Currently,there are numerous stories of successful drug repositioning that have been reported and many repurposed drugs are already available on the market. Although drug repositioning is often a product of serendipity, repositioning opportunities can be uncovered systematically. There are three systematic approaches to drug repositioning: disease-centric approach, target-centric and drug-centric. Disease-centric approaches identify close relationships between an old and a new indication. A target-centric approach links a known target and its established drug to a new indication. Lastly, a drug-centric approach connects a known drug to a new target and its associated indication. These three approaches differ in their potential and their limitations, but above all else, in the required start information and computing power. This raises the question of which approach prevails in current drug discovery and what that implies for future developments. To address this question, we systematically evaluated over 100 drugs, 200 target structures and over 300 indications from the Drug Repositioning Database. Each analyzed case was classified as one of the three repositioning approaches. For the majority of cases (more than 60%) the disease-centric definition was assigned. Almost 30% of the cases were classified as target-centric and less than 10% as drug-centric approaches. We concluded that, despite the use of umbrella term ""drug"" repositioning, disease- and target-centric approaches have dominated the field until now. We propose the use of drug-centric approaches while discussing reasons, such as structure-based repositioning techniques, to exploit the full potential of drug-target-disease connections.","Drug repositioning aims to find new indications for existing drugs in order to reduce drug development cost and time.

In this study, three compounds, indole-3-carbaldehyde, indole-3-carboxylic acid (3-ICA), and jasmonic acid (JA), were isolated from the EtOAc extract of the culture filtrate of the endophytic fungus <i>Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae</i> LPS-1, which was previously isolated from the medicinal plant, <i>Ilex cornuta</i>. Some experiments were conducted to further determine the antifungal activity of these compounds on wheat powdery mildew. The results showed that JA was much more bioactive than indole-3-carbaldehyde and 3-ICA against <i>Blumeria graminis</i>, and the disease severity caused by <i>B. graminis</i> decreased significantly with the concentration increase of JA treatment. The assay of the interaction of 3-ICA and JA indicated that there was a significant synergistic effect between the two compounds on <i>B. graminis</i> in each of the ratios of 3-ICA to JA (3-ICA:JA) ranging from 1:9 to 9:1. When the compound ratio of 3-ICA to JA was 2:8, the synergistic coefficient was the highest as 22.95. Meanwhile, a histological investigation indicated that, under the treatment of JA at 500 μg/ml or 3-ICA:JA (2:8) at 40 μg/ml, the appressorium development and haustorium formation of <i>B. graminis</i> were significantly inhibited.

These are well-known for the production of aflatoxin (AF) B and G and other toxic metabolites, like cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). They are saprophytic soil dwellers and also become crop opportunistic epiphytes. The consequence is contamination of the crop with mycotoxins, such as carcinogenic AF. We investigated the Flavi community structure of maize and that of their surrounding soil, including their mycotoxigenicity. Furthermore, we investigated the link of the maize Flavi diversity with preharvest maize AF levels. The study was carried out in four selected districts of Zambia, in a low rainfall zone. The Flavi characterisation was triphasic, involving morphological (colony colour and sclerotia formation), metabolic (AF and CPA production) and genetic (calmodulin gene polymorphism) analyses. Flavi abundance was determined by dilution plate technique on modified rose Bengal agar. Results showed that Flavi communities on maize and in soil differed. Maize had a higher Flavi species diversity than soil. A. parasiticus dominated the soil community by frequency of field appearance (85%), while maize was dominated by A. minisclerotigenes (45%). CPA-producers with or without AF production dominated the maize (65%) while producers of only AF (B/G) dominated the soil (88%). The ratio between maize A. parasiticus and A. minisclerotigenes abundance seemed to have had a bearing on the levels of AF in maize, with a ratio close to 1:1 having higher levels than a pure community of either A. parasiticus or A. minisclerotigenes.","Aspergillus section Flavi (Flavi) is a diverse group of fungal species whose common members include A. flavus and A. parasiticus. These are well-known for the production of aflatoxin (AF) B and G and other toxic metabolites, like cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). They are saprophytic soil dwellers and also become crop opportunistic epiphytes. The consequence is contamination of the crop with mycotoxins, such as carcinogenic AF. We investigated the Flavi community structure of maize and that of their surrounding soil, including their mycotoxigenicity. Furthermore, we investigated the link of the maize Flavi diversity with preharvest maize AF levels. The study was carried out in four selected districts of Zambia, in a low rainfall zone. The Flavi characterisation was triphasic, involving morphological (colony colour and sclerotia formation), metabolic (AF and CPA production) and genetic (calmodulin gene polymorphism) analyses. Flavi abundance was determined by dilution plate technique on modified rose Bengal agar. Results showed that Flavi communities on maize and in soil differed. Maize had a higher Flavi species diversity than soil. A. parasiticus dominated the soil community by frequency of field appearance (85%), while maize was dominated by A. minisclerotigenes (45%). CPA-producers with or without AF production dominated the maize (65%) while producers of only AF (B/G) dominated the soil (88%).

An experiment with 90 days of feeding was conducted to investigate the efficacy of biochar obtained from different sources such as parthenium, farmyard manure, poultry waste, vegetable waste, and corncob waste at 2 mg/kg. There were15 fingerlings in each tank in the triplicate set of tanks. Fingerlings were fed at the rate of 5 % of their live wet weight. From each tank, feces were collected twice daily and stored to determine nutrient digestibility. Results showed that poultry waste biochar (test diet-IV) at 2 mg/kg was the best source to significantly (P < 0.05) improve weight gain % (256.58 %) and feed conversion ratio (1.19) than the other biochar sources and control diet. Furthermore, in terms of nutrient digestibility, optimum fat (81.90 %), protein (75.92 %), and gross energy (74.84 kcalg<sup>-1</sup>) values were obtained by using the same type of biochar (poultry waste). Conclusively, among all the five biochar sources, poultry waste biochar proved to be the best one, improving fish body performance.","The purpose of the current research was to determine the impact of various biochar supplements on nutrient digestibility and growth performance of <i>Catla catla</i> fingerlings fed on <i>Moringa oleifera</i> seed meal (MOSM) based diet.

10.1371/journal.pone.0288056,Evaluation of healing progression at surgical incision sites and the use of antiseptics for enhancing post-operative survival in subyearling Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha).,"In an attempt to develop more effective surgical implantation methods for fish, surgical incisions typical of those made for implanting micro-acoustic transmitters into the peritoneal cavity were evaluated on a weekly basis for healing progression using a suite of metrics. Additionally, four chemicals were evaluated at concentrations commonly used in aquaculture for their ability to prevent surgical site infection and thus to promote incision healing and survival. Chemical treatments included hydrogen peroxide (25, 50, and 100 mg l-1), salt (10 and 30 ppt), Argentyne (1:1, Argentyne:water), and PolyAqua (1/2 tsp 36 l-1). For all study fish, the presence of two intact sutures seven days post-surgery (generally associated with good suturing technique) was negatively correlated with survival. A generalized linear mixed effects model indicated that suture presence, increasing tagging temperature, and the presence of foreign material on sutures decreased survival by 0.56, 0.72 and 0.60 respectively. Conversely, evidence of suture tearing and increasing fork length at tagging increased survival by 0.24 and 0.17. The antiseptic treatments tested promoted neither faster healing of surgical incisions nor higher survival for fish held for 28 days compared to a reference group and two of the chemicals may be contraindicated for prophylactic use at published doses. These findings underscore the need for researchers to adopt a decidedly cautious approach to planning and interpretation of study outcomes that rely on telemetry tagging, carefully considering the study subjects, potential effects of the techniques used, and implications of the environmental conditions experienced.","In an attempt to develop more effective surgical implantation methods for fish, surgical incisions typical of those made for implanting micro-acoustic transmitters into the peritoneal cavity were evaluated on a weekly basis for healing progression using a suite of metrics.

10.1371/journal.pone.0201865,How symbiosis and ecological context influence the variable expression of transgenerational wing induction upon fungal infection of aphids.,"Aphids, like most animals, mount a diverse set of defenses against pathogens. For aphids, two of the best studied defenses are symbiont-conferred protection and transgenerational wing induction. Aphids can harbor bacterial symbionts that provide protection against pathogens, parasitoids and predators, as well as against other environmental stressors. In response to signals of danger, aphids also protect not themselves but their offspring by producing more winged than unwinged offspring as a way to ensure that their progeny may be able to escape deteriorating conditions. Such transgenerational wing induction has been studied most commonly as a response to overcrowding of host plants and presence of predators, but recent evidence suggests that pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) may also begin to produce a greater proportion of winged offspring when infected with fungal pathogens. Here, we explore this phenomenon further by asking how protective symbionts, pathogen dosage and environmental conditions influence this response. Overall, while we find some evidence that protective symbionts can modulate transgenerational wing induction in response to fungal pathogens, we observe that transgenerational wing induction in response to fungal infection is highly variable. That variability cannot be explained entirely by symbiont association, by pathogen load or by environmental stress, leaving the possibility that a complex interplay of genotypic and environmental factors may together influence this trait.","Aphids, like most animals, mount a diverse set of defenses against pathogens.

Specific indicators of environmental conditions and drying properties were analyzed using two seedless grape varieties (<i>Crimson</i>-red and <i>Thompson</i>-white), artificially inoculated with <i>Aspergillus carbonarius</i> under open air and tunnel drying. The air temperature (T), relative humidity, grape surface temperature (T<sub>s</sub>) and water activity throughout the drying experiment, the grapes' moisture content and the fungal colonization and OTA contamination during the drying process and their interactions were recorded and critically analyzed. Drying properties such as the water diffusivity (D<sub>eff</sub>) and peel resistance to water transfer were estimated.

OTA contamination was higher in tunnel vs. open air-dried grapes, but fungal colonies showed the opposite trend. The D<sub>eff</sub> was higher in tunnel than in the open air-drying by 54%; the infected grapes had more than 70% higher D<sub>eff</sub> than the control, differences explained by factors affecting the water transport.

This polymer is vital for cell wall stiffness and, ultimately, cell shape. Most fungal genomes contain numerous putative chitin synthase encoding genes. However, systematic functional analysis of the full chitin synthase catalogue in a given species is rare. This greatly limits fundamental understanding and potential applications of manipulating chitin synthesis across the fungal kingdom.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we conducted in silico profiling and subsequently deleted all predicted chitin synthase encoding genes in the multipurpose cell factory Aspergillus niger. Phylogenetic analysis suggested nine chitin synthases evolved as three distinct groups. Transcript profiling and co-expression network construction revealed remarkably independent expression, strongly supporting specific role(s) for the respective chitin synthases. Deletion mutants confirmed all genes were dispensable for germination, yet impacted colony spore titres, chitin content at hyphal septa, and internal architecture of submerged fungal pellets. We were also able to assign specific roles to individual chitin synthases, including those impacting colony radial growth rates (ChsE, ChsF), lateral cell wall chitin content (CsmA), chemical genetic interactions with a secreted antifungal protein (CsmA, CsmB, ChsE, ChsF), resistance to therapeutics (ChsE), and those that modulated pellet diameter in liquid culture (ChsA, ChsB). From an applied perspective, we show chsF deletion increases total protein in culture supernatant over threefold compared to the control strain, indicating engineering filamentous fungal chitin content is a high priority yet underexplored strategy for strain optimization.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study has conducted extensive analysis for the full chitin synthase encoding gene repertoire of A. niger. For the first time we reveal both redundant and non-redundant functional roles of chitin synthases in this fungus. Our data shed light on the complex, multifaceted, and dynamic role of chitin in fungal growth, morphology, survival, and secretion, thus improving fundamental understanding and opening new avenues for biotechnological applications in fungi.","<h4>Background</h4>Members of the fungal kingdom are heterotrophic eukaryotes encased in a chitin containing cell wall.

Human plasma protein α1-antitrypsin (AAT) exhibits pleiotropic immune-modulating properties by both preventing immunopathology and improving antimicrobial host defence. Genetic associations suggested a role for AAT in candidemia, the most frequent fungal blood stream infection in intensive care units, yet little is known about how AAT influences interactions between <i>Candida albicans</i> and the immune system. Here, we show that AAT differentially impacts fungal killing by innate phagocytes. We observed that AAT induces fungal transcriptional reprogramming, associated with cell wall remodelling and downregulation of filamentation repressors. At low concentrations, the cell-wall remodelling induced by AAT increased immunogenic β-glucan exposure and consequently improved fungal clearance by monocytes. Contrastingly, higher AAT concentrations led to excessive <i>C. albicans</i> filamentation and thus promoted fungal immune escape from monocytes and macrophages. This underscores that fungal adaptations to the host protein AAT can differentially define the outcome of encounters with innate immune cells, either contributing to improved immune recognition or fungal immune escape.","Our immune system possesses sophisticated mechanisms to cope with invading microorganisms, while pathogens evolve strategies to deal with threats imposed by host immunity.

We exploited the stepwise infection dynamics of an entomopathogenic fungus in a termite to explore how care-kill transitions occur, and identify the chemical cues behind these shifts. We found collective responses towards pathogen-injected individuals to vary according to severity and timing of pathogen challenge, with elimination, via cannibalism, occurring sooner in response to a severe active infection. However, injection with inactivated fungal blastospores also resulted in increased albeit delayed cannibalism, even though it did not universally cause host death. This indicates that the decision to eliminate an individual is triggered before pathogen viability or terminal disease status has been established. We then compared the surface chemistry of differently challenged individuals, finding increased amounts of long-chained methyl-branched alkanes with similar branching patterns in individuals injected with both dead and viable fungal blastospores, with the latter showing the largest increase. This coincided with the highest amounts of observed cannibalism as well as signs of severe moribundity. Our study provides new mechanistic insight into the emergent collective behaviors involved in the disease defense of a termite society.","The care-kill response determines whether a sick individual will be treated or eliminated from an insect society, but little is known about the physiological underpinnings of this process.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are functionally active, nanoscale, membrane-bound vesicles secreted by almost all eukaryotic cells. Intriguingly, plant-derived extracellular vesicles (PDEVs) also have been implicated to play an important role in therapeutic application. PDEVs were reported to have physical and chemical properties similar to mammalian EVs, which are rich in lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and pharmacologically active compounds. Besides these properties, PDEVs also exhibit unique advantages, especially intrinsic bioactivity, high stability, and easy absorption. PDEVs were found to be transferred into recipient cells and significantly affect their biological process involved in many diseases, such as inflammation and tumors. PDEVs also could offer unique morphological and compositional characteristics as natural nanocarriers by innately shuttling bioactive lipids, RNA, proteins, and other pharmacologically active substances. In addition, PDEVs could effectively encapsulate hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemicals, remain stable, and cross stringent biological barriers. Thus, this study focuses on the pharmacological action and mechanisms of PDEVs in therapeutic applications. We also systemically deal with facets of PDEVs, ranging from their isolation to composition, biological functions, and biotherapeutic roles. Efforts are also made to elucidate recent advances in re-engineering PDEVs applied as stable, effective, and non-immunogenic therapeutic applications to meet the ever-stringent demands. Considering its unique advantages, these studies not only provide relevant scientific evidence on therapeutic applications but could also replenish and inherit precious cultural heritage.","Medicinal plants are the primary sources for the discovery of novel medicines and the basis of ethnopharmacological research.

There are very few studies on the bioavailability of coumarins; therefore, further investigations are necessitated to study the bioavailability of different coumarins which already showed good biological activities in previous studies. On the evidence of varied pharmacological properties, the present work presents an overall review of the derivation, availability, and biological capacities of coumarins with further consideration of the essential mode of their therapeutic actions. In conclusion, a wide variety of coumarins are available, and their pharmacological activities are of current interest thanks to their synthetic accessibility and riches in medicinal plants. Coumarins perform the valuable function as therapeutic agents in a range of medical fields.","Coumarins belong to the benzopyrone family commonly found in many medicinal plants.

However, an accurate account of its burden in Africa, where most cases are thought to occur, is lacking. We aim to systematically evaluate the burden, aetiology and epidemiological trend of tinea capitis among children over a 30-year period in Africa.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>A systematic review will be conducted using Embase, PubMed, African Journals Online, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library of Systematic Review. These resources will be used to identify studies published between 1990 and December 2020, which report the prevalence, aetiology and trend of tinea capitis among children younger than 18 years in Africa. Articles in English and French will be considered. Two independent reviewers will screen the articles for eligibility, and any discrepancies will be resolved by discussion and consensus between the authors. Methodological quality of all studies will be assessed and critically appraised. We will perform a metaregression to assess the impact of study characteristics on heterogeneity and also to correct the meta-analytical estimates for biases. A qualitative synthesis will be performed, and STATA V.16.0 software will be used to estimate the pooled prevalence and aetiology of tinea capitis. The Mann-Kendall trend test will be use to evaluate the trend in the prevalence of tinea capitis over the study period.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>Ethical approval from an institutional review board or research ethics committee is not required for this systematic review and meta-analysis. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented in conferences.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Tinea capitis is the most common form of dermatophytosis among children, contributing significantly to the global burden of skin and hair infections.

Plant disease and land drought will make the situation more dire, and safer and environment-friendly materials are thus considered as a new countermeasure. The rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, causes one of the most destructive diseases of cultivated rice worldwide that seriously threatens rice production. Unfortunately, traditional breeding nor chemical approaches along control it well. Nowadays, nanotechnology stands as a new weapon against these mounting challenges and silica nanoparticles (SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs) have been considered as potential new safer agrochemicals recently but the systematically studies remain limited, especially in rice.<h4>Results</h4>Salicylic acid (SA) is a key plant hormone essential for establishing plant resistance to several pathogens and its further affected a special form of induced resistance, the systemic acquired resistance (SAR), which considered as an important aspect of plant innate immunity from the locally induced disease resistance to the whole plant. Here we showed that SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs could stimulate plant immunity to protect rice against M. oryzae through foliar treatment that significantly decreased disease severity by nearly 70% within an appropriate concentration range. Excessive concentration of foliar treatment led to disordered intake and abnormal SA responsive genes expressions which weaken the plant resistance and even aggravated the disease. Importantly, this SA-dependent fungal resistance could achieve better results with root treatment through a SAR manner with no phytotoxicity since the orderly and moderate absorption. What's more, root treatment with SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs could also promote root development which was better to deal with drought.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Taken together, our findings not only revealed SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs as a potential effective and safe strategy to protect rice against biotic and abiotic stresses, but also identify root treatment for the appropriate application method since it seems not causing negative effects and even have promotion on root development.","<h4>Background</h4>By 2050, the world population will increase to 10 billion which urged global demand for food production to double.

10.3390/jof9121166,Miltefosine: A Repurposing Drug against Mucorales Pathogens.,"Mucorales are a group of non-septated filamentous fungi widely distributed in nature, frequently associated with human infections, and are intrinsically resistant to many antifungal drugs. For these reasons, there is an urgent need to improve the clinical management of mucormycosis. Miltefosine, which is a phospholipid analogue of alkylphosphocholine, has been considered a promising repurposing drug to be used to treat fungal infections. In the present study, miltefosine displayed antifungal activity against a variety of Mucorales species, and it was also active against biofilms formed by these fungi. Treatment with miltefosine revealed modifications of cell wall components, neutral lipids, mitochondrial membrane potential, cell morphology, and the induction of oxidative stress. Treated Mucorales cells also presented an increased susceptibility to SDS. Purified ergosterol and glucosylceramide added to the culture medium increased miltefosine MIC, suggesting its interaction with fungal lipids. These data contribute to elucidating the effect of a promising drug repurposed to act against some relevant fungal pathogens that significantly impact public health.","Mucorales are a group of non-septated filamentous fungi widely distributed in nature, frequently associated with human infections, and are intrinsically resistant to many antifungal drugs.

To ensure whether inoculation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) with Chinese fir (<i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i>) under low P stress conditions could promote its growth and P utilization capacity, an indoor pot simulation experiment was carried out with the different P supply treatments and Chinese fir seedlings as the tested material.<h4>Methods</h4>The experiment had two P supply treatments, no P supply (P0, 0 mmol·L<sup>-1</sup> KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and normal P supply (P1, 1.0 mmol·L<sup>-1</sup> KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>). The seedling in each P supply treatment was inoculated with <i>Glomus intraradices</i> (Gi), a widespread species of AMF in the natural environment, and with no AMF inoculation as a control treatment (CK). The Gi infection rate in the root system, root cortex tissue dissolution rate, root morphological indexes and biomass, whole plant P use efficiency, and root P use efficiency of Chinese fir were determined under different treatment conditions.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>The results showed that P0 treatment significantly increased the Gi infection rate (<i>p</i>< 0.05). After inoculating AMF with different P supply treatments, the root cortex tissue dissolution rate was considerably enhanced. In contrast, the Chinese fir's root length and surface area were reduced; however, the root volume did not change significantly.

10.3390/plants11030436,Extracts from Environmental Strains of <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp. Effectively Control Fungal Plant Diseases.,"The use of synthetic chemical products in agriculture is causing severe damage to the environment and human health, but agrochemicals are still widely used to protect our crops. To counteract this trend, we have been looking for alternative strategies to control plant diseases without causing harm to the environment or damage to our health. However, these alternatives are still far from completely replacing chemical products. Microorganisms have been widely known as a biological tool to control plant diseases, but their use is still limited due to the high variability in their efficacy, together with issues in product registration. However, the metabolites produced by these microorganisms can represent a novel tool for the environment-friendly management of plant diseases, while reducing the issues mentioned above. In this study, we explore the soil microbial diversity in natural systems to look for microorganisms with the potential to be used in pre- and post-harvest protection against fungal plant pathogens. Using a simple workflow, we isolated 22 bacterial strains that were tested both in vitro and in vivo for their ability to counteract the growth of common plant pathogens. The three best isolates, identified as members of the bacterial genus <i>Pseudomonas</i>, were used to produce a series of alcoholic extracts, which were then tested for their action against plant pathogens in simulated real-world applications. Results show that extracts from these isolates have an exceptional biocontrol activity and can be successfully used to control plant pathogens in operational setups. Thus, this study shows that the environmental microbiome is an important source of microorganisms producing metabolites that might provide an alternative strategy to synthetic chemical products.","The use of synthetic chemical products in agriculture is causing severe damage to the environment and human health, but agrochemicals are still widely used to protect our crops.

10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15056.3,The diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis in adults and adolescents: protocol for a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis to inform a multivariable prediction model.,"<b>Background:</b> Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most lethal and disabling form of tuberculosis. Delayed diagnosis and treatment, which is a risk factor for poor outcome, is caused in part by lack of availability of diagnostic tests that are both rapid and accurate. Several attempts have been made to develop clinical scoring systems to fill this gap, but none have performed sufficiently well to be broadly implemented. We aim to identify and validate a set of clinical predictors that accurately classify TBM using individual patient data (IPD) from published studies. <b>Methods:</b> We will perform a systematic review and obtain IPD from studies published from the year 1990 which undertook diagnostic testing for TBM in adolescents or adults using at least one of, microscopy for acid-fast bacilli, commercial nucleic acid amplification test for <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> or mycobacterial culture of cerebrospinal fluid.  Clinical data that have previously been shown to be associated with TBM, and can inform the final diagnosis, will be requested. The data-set will be divided into training and test/validation data-sets for model building. A predictive logistic model will be built using a training set with patients with definite TBM and no TBM. Should it be warranted, factor analysis may be employed, depending on evidence for multicollinearity or the case for including latent variables in the model. <b>Discussion:</b> We will systematically identify and extract key clinical parameters associated with TBM from published studies and use a 'big data' approach to develop and validate a clinical prediction model with enhanced generalisability. The final model will be made available through a smartphone application. Further work will be external validation of the model and test of efficacy in a randomised controlled trial.","<b>Background:</b> Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most lethal and disabling form of tuberculosis.

Surprisingly, BABA soil drench of woodland strawberry (<i>Fragaria vesca</i>) plants two days before <i>B. cinerea</i> inoculation caused increased infection in leaf tissues, suggesting that BABA induce systemic susceptibility in <i>F. vesca</i>. To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in <i>B. cinerea</i> susceptibility in leaves of <i>F. vesca</i> plants soil drenched with BABA, we used RNA sequencing to characterize the transcriptional reprogramming 24 h post-inoculation. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in infected <i>vs</i>. uninfected leaf tissue in BABA-treated plants was 5205 (2237 upregulated and 2968 downregulated). Upregulated genes were involved in pathogen recognition, defense response signaling, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (terpenoid and phenylpropanoid pathways), while downregulated genes were involved in photosynthesis and response to auxin. In control plants not treated with BABA, we found a total of 5300 DEGs (2461 upregulated and 2839 downregulated) after infection. Most of these corresponded to those in infected leaves of BABA-treated plants but a small subset of DEGs, including genes involved in 'response to biologic stimulus', 'photosynthesis' and 'chlorophyll biosynthesis and metabolism', differed significantly between treatments and could play a role in the induced susceptibility of BABA-treated plants.","Grey mold caused by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> can affect leaves, flowers, and berries of strawberry, causing severe pre- and postharvest damage.

In the absence of any reviews on the subject, we conducted a systematic review of the aetiopathogenesis and pathophysiology of pigmented fungiform papillae (PFP) of the tongue, including its demographic and histopathological features, trying to outline a possible aetiology. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) was performed using PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE databases and manual searches, for publications between January 1974 and July 2022. Inclusion criteria were case reports defining patients' characteristics, their general medical and dental conditions, histopathological and/or immunohistochemical findings, all with a final definitive diagnosis of PFP. Overall, 51 studies comprising 69 cases of PFP which included histopathological descriptions were reviewed. Prominent features consisted of hyperpigmentation of melanocytes, melanophages, chromatophores, and a lymphocytic infiltrate in the subepidermal area of the fungiform papillae. On special staining, PFP contained melanin, not iron or hemosiderin. On immunohistochemistry, immune-reactive CD3+ T lymphocytes, S-100 and Sox10, but non-immune-reactive melan-A intraepithelial melanocytes were noted in some studies. The presence of hyperpigmented melanocytes and melanophages, with non-immune-reactive melan-A, suggests that PFP are a benign and physiological form of pigmentation. The inflammatory infiltrates described in some papillary lesions could possibly be due to traumatic events during mastication. Nevertheless, the true reasons for the hyperpigmentation of the fungiform papillae are as of yet elusive, and remain to be determined.","The pigmentation of the fungiform papillae of the tongue is a rare idiopathic condition in which only the fungiform papillae appear hyperpigmented.

10.12659/ajcr.924179,Coccidioidomycosis and Pulmonary Emboli: A Report of 5 Cases.,"BACKGROUND Coccidioidomycosis is endemic to the Sonoran life zone, which extends from Latin America to the western United States. The principle manifestation is pneumonia but disseminated disease also occurs. Venous thromboembolism occurring in association with this disease has not been reported. We encountered 5 cases of coccidioidomycosis, each complicated by pulmonary emboli, during a single year. We report these cases with the intent of making those caring for patients with coccidioidomycosis aware of this association. CASE REPORT A 35-year-old man developed fever and respiratory symptoms. He was initially treated with antibiotics as an outpatient and during a subsequent hospitalization.

The principle manifestation is pneumonia but disseminated disease also occurs. Venous thromboembolism occurring in association with this disease has not been reported. We encountered 5 cases of coccidioidomycosis, each complicated by pulmonary emboli, during a single year. We report these cases with the intent of making those caring for patients with coccidioidomycosis aware of this association. CASE REPORT A 35-year-old man developed fever and respiratory symptoms. He was initially treated with antibiotics as an outpatient and during a subsequent hospitalization. He was readmitted because of persistent respiratory symptoms and treated presumptively for coccidioidomycosis pneumonia. Hypoxemia persisted and multiple acute pulmonary emboli were evident on imaging. Serological study and organism identification confirmed a diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis infection. Details of this case and 4 additional cases are described. CONCLUSIONS Venous thromboembolism occurred in 5 patients with pulmonary coccidioidomycosis.

Vital to this success is their ability to secrete a diverse range of molecules, including hydrolytic enzymes, organic acids, and small molecular weight natural products. Industrial biotechnologists have successfully harnessed and re-engineered the secretory capacity of dozens of filamentous fungal species to make a diverse portfolio of useful molecules. The study of fungal secretion outside fermenters, e.g., during host infection or in mixed microbial communities, has also led to the development of novel and emerging technological breakthroughs, ranging from ultra-sensitive biosensors of fungal disease to the efficient bioremediation of polluted environments. In this review, we consider filamentous fungal secretion across multiple disciplinary boundaries (e.g., white, green, and red biotechnology) and product classes (protein, organic acid, and secondary metabolite). We summarize the mechanistic understanding for how various molecules are secreted and present numerous applications for extracellular products. Additionally, we discuss how the control of secretory pathways and the polar growth of filamentous hyphae can be utilized in diverse settings, including industrial biotechnology, agriculture, and the clinic.","Filamentous fungi are found in virtually every marine and terrestrial habitat.

10.1093/ofid/ofac655,Immune-Based Therapy for Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19 and Risk of Secondary Infections: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Immune-based therapies are standard-of-care treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients requiring hospitalization. However, safety concerns related to the potential risk of secondary infections may limit their use.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched OVID Medline, Ovid EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, and PROSPERO in October 2020 and updated the search in November 2021. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Pairs of reviewers screened abstracts and full studies and extracted data in an independent manner. We used RevMan to conduct a meta-analysis using random-effects models to calculate the pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI for the incidence of infection. Statistical heterogeneity was determined using the <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> statistic. We assessed risk of bias for all studies and rated the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. We conducted a meta-regression using the R package to meta-explore whether age, sex, and invasive mechanical ventilation modified risk of infection with immune-based therapies. The protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021229406).<h4>Results</h4>This was a meta-analysis of 37 RCTs including 32 621 participants (mean age, 60 years; 64% male). The use of immune-based therapy for COVID-19 conferred mild protection for the occurrence of secondary infections (711/15 721, 4.5%, vs 616/16 900, 3.6%; RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71-0.95; <i>P</i> = .008; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 28%). A subgroup analysis did not identify any subgroup effect by type of immune-based therapies (<i>P</i> = .85).

By being localised at the interface of the pollen-stigma interaction, the pollen coat plays a central role in mediating early pollination events, including molecular recognition. Amongst species of the Brassicaceae, a growing body of data has revealed that the pollen coat carries a range of proteins, with a number of small cysteine-rich proteins (CRPs) being identified as important regulators of the pollen-stigma interaction.

Arguably, zoospore root attachment is the most critical phase of infection; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This study investigated the potential role of root-surface cell-wall polysaccharides and proteins in cultivars resistant/susceptible to zoospore attachment. We first compared the effects of enzymatic removal of root cell-wall proteins, <i>N</i>-linked glycans and polysaccharides on <i>S. subterranea</i> attachment. Subsequent analysis of peptides released by trypsin shaving (TS) of root segments identified 262 proteins that were differentially abundant between cultivars. These were enriched in root-surface-derived peptides but also included intracellular proteins, e.g., proteins associated with glutathione metabolism and lignin biosynthesis, which were more abundant in the resistant cultivar. Comparison with whole-root proteomic analysis of the same cultivars identified 226 proteins specific to the TS dataset, of which 188 were significantly different. Among these, the pathogen-defence-related cell-wall protein stem 28 kDa glycoprotein and two major latex proteins were significantly less abundant in the resistant cultivar. A further major latex protein was reduced in the resistant cultivar in both the TS and whole-root datasets. In contrast, three glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase proteins were more abundant in the resistant cultivar (TS-specific), while the protein glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase was increased in both datasets.

Silks also provide entry points for pathogens into host tissues since fungal hyphae move along the surface of the silks to reach the site of infection, i.e., the developing kernel. The outer extracellular surface of the silk is covered by a protective hydrophobic cuticle, comprised of a complex array of long-chain hydrocarbons and small amounts of very long chain fatty acids and fatty alcohols. This work illustrates that two previously characterized cuticle-related genes separately exert roles on maize silk cuticle deposition and function. <i>ZmMYB94</i>/<i>FUSED LEAVES 1</i> (<i>ZmFDL1</i>) MYB transcription factor is a key regulator of cuticle deposition in maize seedlings. The <i>ZmGLOSSY2</i> (<i>ZmGL2</i>) gene, a putative member of the BAHD superfamily of acyltransferases with close sequence similarity to the Arabidopsis <i>AtCER2</i> gene, is involved in the elongation of the fatty acid chains that serve as precursors of the waxes on young leaves. In silks, lack of <i>ZmFDL1</i> action generates a decrease in the accumulation of a wide number of compounds, including alkanes and alkenes of 20 carbons or greater and affects the expression of cuticle-related genes. These results suggest that <i>ZmFDL1</i> retains a regulatory role in silks, which might be exerted across the entire wax biosynthesis pathway. Separately, a comparison between <i>gl2-ref</i> and wild-type silks reveals differences in the abundance of specific cuticular wax constituents, particularly those of longer unsaturated carbon chain lengths. The inferred role of <i>ZmGL2</i> is to control the chain lengths of unsaturated hydrocarbons.

Compared to the non-treated faba bean plants, the applications of 33504-Alex1 in either soil or foliar application significantly promoted growth and improved total chlorophyll content, resulting in a considerable reduction in disease incidence and severity and the inhibition index of BYMV in the treated faba bean plants. Furthermore, the protective activities of 33504-Alex1 were associated with significant reductions in non-enzymatic oxidative stress markers [hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and malondialdehyde (MDA)] and remarkably increased DPPH free radical scavenging activity and total phenolic content compared to the BYMV treatment at 20 days post-inoculation.

PCNSL is defined as a lymphoma that occurs in the brain, spinal cord, leptomeninges, or eyes. Efforts to treat PCNSL by traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy have generally been unsuccessful as a significant proportion of patients have frequent relapses or are refractory to treatment. The prognosis of patients with Refractory or Relapsed (R/R) PCNSL is abysmal. The optimal treatment for R/R PCNSL is poorly defined as there are only a limited number of studies in this setting.

10.1002/14651858.cd015064.pub2,Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide and cannot currently be prevented or cured. Topical anti-inflammatory treatments are used to control eczema symptoms, but there is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti-inflammatory treatments.<h4>Objectives</h4>To compare and rank the efficacy and safety of topical anti-inflammatory treatments for people with eczema using a network meta-analysis.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and trial registries on 29 June 2023, and checked the reference lists of included studies.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included within-participant or between-participant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people of any age with eczema of any severity, but excluded trials in clinically infected eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, contact eczema, or hand eczema. We included topical anti-inflammatory treatments used for at least one week, compared with another anti-inflammatory treatment, no treatment, or vehicle/placebo. Vehicle is a 'carrier system' for an active pharmaceutical substance, which may also be used on its own as an emollient for dry skin. We excluded trials of topical antibiotics used alone, complementary therapies, emollients used alone, phototherapy, wet wraps, and systemic treatments.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were patient-reported eczema symptoms, clinician-reported eczema signs and investigator global assessment. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, long-term control of eczema, withdrawal from treatment/study, and local adverse effects (application-site reactions, pigmentation changes and skin thinning/atrophy were identified as important concerns through patient and public involvement). We used CINeMA to quantify our confidence in the evidence for each outcome.<h4>Main results</h4>We included 291 studies involving 45,846 participants with the full spectrum of eczema severity, mainly conducted in high-income countries in secondary care settings. Most studies included adults, with only 31 studies limited to children aged < 12 years. Studies usually included male and female participants, multiple ethnic groups but predominantly white populations. Most studies were industry-funded (68%) or did not report their funding sources/details. Treatment duration and trial participation were a median of 21 and 28 days (ranging from 7 days to 5 years), respectively. Interventions used were topical corticosteroids (TCS) (172), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) (134), phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitors (55), janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (30), aryl hydrocarbon receptor activators (10), or other topical agents (21). Comparators included vehicle (170) or other anti-inflammatory treatments. The risk of bias was high in 242 of the 272 (89.0%) trials contributing to data analyses, most commonly due to concerns about selective reporting. Network meta-analysis (NMA) was only possible for short-term outcomes. Patient-reported symptoms NMA of 40 trials (6482 participants) reporting patient-reported symptoms as a binary outcome ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 6.27, 95% CI 1.19 to 32.98), potent TCS (OR 5.99, 95% CI 2.83 to 12.69), and ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 5.64, 95% CI 1.26 to 25.25) as the most effective, all with low confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, and crisaborole 2% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and was more effective than mild TCI and PDE-4 inhibitors. NMA of 29 trials (3839 participants) reporting patient-reported symptoms as a continuous outcome ranked very potent TCS (SMD -1.99, 95% CI -3.25 to -0.73; low confidence) and tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD -1.57, 95% CI -2.42 to -0.72; moderate confidence) the highest. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial of 60 participants at high risk of bias. Roflumilast 0.15%, delgocitinib 0.25% or 0.5%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and mild/moderate TCS was less effective than mild TCI. A further 50 trials (9636 participants) reported patient-reported symptoms as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA. Clinician-reported signs NMA of 32 trials (4121 participants) reported clinician signs as a binary outcome and ranked potent TCS (OR 8.15, 95% CI 4.99, 13.57), tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 8.06, 95% CI 3.30, 19.67), ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 7.72, 95% CI 4.92, 12.10), and delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 7.61, 95% CI 3.72, 15.58) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, crisaborole 2%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS more effective than potent TCI, mild TCI, JAK inhibitors, PDE-4 inhibitors; and mild TCS and PDE-4 inhibitors had similar effectiveness. NMA of 49 trials (5261 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome and ranked tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD -2.69, 95% CI -3.36, -2.02) and very potent TCS (SMD -1.87, 95% CI -2.69, -1.05) as most effective, both with moderate confidence; roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and tapinarof 1% were ranked as least effective. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial in 60 participants with a high risk of bias. For some sensitivity analyses, potent TCS, tacrolimus 0.1%, ruxolitinib 1.5%, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% became some of the most effective treatments. Class-level analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors, and moderate/mild TCS was more effective than mild TCI. A further 100 trials (22,814 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA. Investigator Global Assessment NMA of 140 trials (23,383 participants) reported IGA as a binary outcome and ranked ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 9.34, 95% CI 4.8, 18.18), delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 10.08, 95% CI 2.65, 38.37), delgocitinib 0.25% (OR 6.87, 95% CI 1.79, 26.33), very potent TCS (OR 8.34, 95% CI 4.73, 14.67), potent TCS (OR 5.00, 95% CI 3.80, 6.58), and tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 5.06, 95% CI 3.59, 7.13) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, crisaborole 2%, pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and 1%, and tacrolimus 0.03% were the least effective. In a sensitivity analysis of low risk of bias information (12 trials, 1639 participants), potent TCS, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% were most effective, and pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 1% and difamilast 0.3% least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and were more effective than PDE-4 inhibitors; mild/moderate TCS were less effective than potent TCI and had similar effectiveness to mild TCI. Longer-term outcomes over 6 to 12 months showed a possible increase in effectiveness for pimecrolimus 1% versus vehicle (4 trials, 2218 participants) in a pairwise meta-analysis, and greater treatment success with mild/moderate TCS than pimecrolimus 1% (based on 1 trial of 2045 participants). Local adverse effects NMA of 83 trials (18,992 participants, 2424 events) reporting application-site reactions ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.53, 3.17; moderate confidence), crisaborole 2% (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.18, 3.81; high confidence), tacrolimus 0.03% (OR 1.51, 95%CI 1.10, 2.09; low confidence), and pimecrolimus 1% (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01, 2.04; low confidence) as most likely to cause site reactions. Very potent, potent, moderate, and mild TCS were least likely to cause site reactions. NMA of eight trials (1786 participants, 3 events) reporting pigmentation changes found no evidence for increased pigmentation changes with TCS and crisaborole 2%, with low confidence for mild, moderate or potent TCS and moderate confidence for crisaborole 2%. NMA of 25 trials (3691 participants, 36 events) reporting skin thinning found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short-term (median 3 weeks, range 1-16 weeks) use of mild TCS (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.12, 4.31), moderate TCS (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.16, 5.33), potent TCS (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.21, 4.43) or very potent TCS (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.31, 2.49), all with low confidence. Longer-term outcomes over 6 to 60 months showed increased skin thinning with mild to potent TCS versus TCI (3 trials, 4069 participants, 6 events with TCS).<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Potent TCS, JAK inhibitors and tacrolimus 0.1% were consistently ranked as amongst the most effective topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema and PDE-4 inhibitors as amongst the least effective. Mild TCS and tapinarof 1% were ranked amongst the least effective treatments in three of five efficacy networks. TCI and crisaborole 2% were ranked most likely to cause local application-site reactions and TCS least likely. We found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short-term TCS but an increase with longer-term TCS.","<h4>Background</h4>Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide and cannot currently be prevented or cured.

10.4254/wjh.v11.i7.596,"Spontaneous fungal peritonitis: Micro-organisms, management and mortality in liver cirrhosis-A systematic review.","<h4>Background</h4>Spontaneous peritonitis is an infection of ascitic fluid without a known intra-abdominal source of infection. spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) is a potentially fatal complication of decompensated cirrhosis, defined as fungal infection of ascitic fluid in the presence of ascitic neutrophil count of greater than 250 cells/mL.<h4>Aim</h4>To determine the prevalence of fungal pathogens, management and outcomes (mortality) of SFP in critically ill cirrhotic patients.<h4>Methods</h4>Studies were identified using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Scopus databases until February 2019. Inclusion criteria included intervention trials and observation studies describing the association between SFP and cirrhosis. The primary outcome was in-hospital, 1-mo, and 6-mo mortality rates of SFP in cirrhotic patients. Secondary outcomes were fungal microorganisms identified and in hospital management by anti-fungal medications. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute quality assessment tools were used to assess internal validity and risk of bias for each included study.<h4>Results</h4>Six observational studies were included in this systematic review. The overall quality of included studies was good. A meta-analysis of results could not be performed because of differences in reporting of outcomes and heterogeneity of the included studies. There were 82 patients with SFP described across all the included studies. Candida species, predominantly <i>Candida albicans</i> was the fungal pathogen in majority of the cases (48%-81.8%) followed by <i>Candida krusei</i> (15%-25%) and <i>Candida glabrata</i> (6.66%-20%). <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> (53.3%) was the other major fungal pathogen. Antifungal therapy in SFP patients was utilized in 33.3% to 81.8% cases. The prevalence of in hospital mortality ranged from 33.3% to 100%, whereas 1-mo mortality ranged between 50% to 73.3%.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This systematic review suggests that SFP in end stage liver disease patient is associated with high mortality both in the hospital and at 1-mo, and that antifungal therapy is currently underutilized.","<h4>Background</h4>Spontaneous peritonitis is an infection of ascitic fluid without a known intra-abdominal source of infection. spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) is a potentially fatal complication of decompensated cirrhosis, defined as fungal infection of ascitic fluid in the presence of ascitic neutrophil count of greater than 250 cells/mL.<h4>Aim</h4>To determine the prevalence of fungal pathogens, management and outcomes (mortality) of SFP in critically ill cirrhotic patients.<h4>Methods</h4>Studies were identified using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Scopus databases until February 2019.

There were 82 patients with SFP described across all the included studies. Candida species, predominantly <i>Candida albicans</i> was the fungal pathogen in majority of the cases (48%-81.8%) followed by <i>Candida krusei</i> (15%-25%) and <i>Candida glabrata</i> (6.66%-20%). <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> (53.3%) was the other major fungal pathogen. Antifungal therapy in SFP patients was utilized in 33.3% to 81.8% cases. The prevalence of in hospital mortality ranged from 33.3% to 100%, whereas 1-mo mortality ranged between 50% to 73.3%.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This systematic review suggests that SFP in end stage liver disease patient is associated with high mortality both in the hospital and at 1-mo, and that antifungal therapy is currently underutilized.",EuropePMC

The sporangiospores of <i>R. arrhizus</i> are omnipresent in the environment and cause infection through inhalation or ingestion of contaminated air and foods. Therefore, the anti-sporangiospore activity of polyethyleneimine functionalized silver nanoparticles (PEI-f-Ag-NPs) with variable size and surface charge as a function of the molecular weight of PEI was explored. The results showed that both PEI-f-AgNP-1 and PEI-f-AgNP-2, potentially, attenuated the germination and reduced the viability of sporangiospores. Furthermore, the results showed that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of both PEI-f-AgNP-1 and PEI-f-AgNP-2 (1.65 and 6.50 μg/mL, respectively) were dependent on the nanoparticle size and surface ζ potentials. Similarly, the sporangiospore germination inhibition at MIC values was recorded, showing 97.33% and 94% germination inhibition, respectively, by PEI-f-AgNP-1 and 2 within 24 h, respectively. The confocal laser scanning microscopy, SEM-EDS, and confocal Raman spectroscopy investigation of PEI-f-Ag-NPs treated sporangiospores confirmed size and surface charge-dependent killing dynamics in sporangiospores.

10.1002/eji.202049068,Non-neutralizing antibodies protect against chronic LCMV infection by promoting infection of inflammatory monocytes in mice.,"Antibodies play an important role in host defense against microorganisms. Besides direct microbicidal activities, antibodies can also provide indirect protection via crosstalk to constituents of the adaptive immune system. Similar to many human chronic viral infections, persistence of Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is associated with compromised T- and B-cell responses. The administration of virus-specific non-neutralizing antibodies (nnAbs) prior to LCMV infection protects against the establishment of chronic infection. Here, we show that LCMV-specific nnAbs bind preferentially Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocytes (IMs), promote their infection in an Fc-receptor independent way, and support acquisition of APC properties. By constituting additional T-cell priming opportunities, IMs promote early activation of virus-specific CD8 T cells, eventually tipping the balance between T-cell exhaustion and effector cell differentiation, preventing establishment of viral persistence without causing lethal immunopathology. These results document a beneficial role of IMs in avoiding T-cell exhaustion and an Fc-receptor independent protective mechanism provided by LCMV-specific nnAbs against the establishment of chronic infection.","Antibodies play an important role in host defense against microorganisms.

In the global digitalization trend, digital technology based on optical sensors can perform the digitization of seed phenotype in a non-contact, high throughput way, thus significantly improving breeding efficiency.<h4>Aim of review</h4>This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the principles, characteristics, data processing methods, and bottlenecks associated with three digital technique types based on optical sensors: spectroscopy, digital imaging, and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction techniques. In addition, the applicability and adaptability of digital techniques based on the optical sensors of maize seed phenotype traits, namely external visible phenotype (EVP) and internal invisible phenotype (IIP), are investigated. Furthermore, trends in future equipment, platform, phenotype data, and processing algorithms are discussed. This review offers conceptual and practical support for seed phenotype digitization based on optical sensors, which will provide reference and guidance for future research.<h4>Key scientific concepts of review</h4>The digital techniques based on optical sensors can perform non-contact and high-throughput seed phenotype evaluation. Due to the distinct characteristics of optical sensors, matching suitable digital techniques according to seed phenotype traits can greatly reduce resource loss, and promote the efficiency of seed evaluation as well as breeding decision-making.

There is no single systematic review of the literature that indicates the different clinical aspects of RM.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic search of PubMed/Medline was performed to collect individual case reports of RM in patients of all ages published between 2010 and April 2022.<h4>Results</h4>Seventy-one individual cases were detected through PubMed bibliographic database searches, with a final assessment performed on 60 patients with RM. India and Asia had the largest number of reported cases, with 30 (50%) and 42 (70%) reports, respectively. Also, 74 and 26% of the patients with a mean age of 33 years were male and female, respectively. RM showed 44% mortality rate in the analyzed cases. Immunosuppressive agent therapy followed by tissue transplantation (kidney and liver) and diabetes were the most remarkable risk factors in patients. Nevertheless, 22% of the patients were immunocompetent with no apparent underlying condition. COVID-19 positivity was detected in eight adult patients with an 87% mortality rate. The most common signs of infection were fever, flank pain, and oliguria; additionally, isolated RM was reported in 57% of the cases.

10.3389/fmicb.2020.02058,A Plumieridine-Rich Fraction From <i>Allamanda polyantha</i> Inhibits Chitinolytic Activity and Exhibits Antifungal Properties Against <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>.,"Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection caused mainly by the pathogenic yeasts <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> and <i>Cryptococcus gattii</i>. The infection initiates with the inhalation of propagules that are then deposited in the lungs. If not properly treated, cryptococci cells can disseminate and reach the central nervous system. The current recommended treatment for cryptococcosis employs a three-stage regimen, with the administration of amphotericin B, flucytosine and fluconazole. Although effective, these drugs are often unavailable worldwide, can lead to resistance development, and may display toxic effects on the patients. Thus, new drugs for cryptococcosis treatment are needed. Recently, an iridoid named plumieridine was found in <i>Allamanda polyantha</i> seed extract; it exhibited antifungal activity against <i>C. neoformans</i> with a MIC of 250 μg/mL. To address the mode of action of plumieridine, several <i>in silico</i> and <i>in vitro</i> experiments were performed. Through a ligand-based a virtual screening approach, chitinases were identified as potential targets. Confirmatory <i>in vitro</i> assays showed that <i>C. neoformans</i> cell-free supernatant incubated with plumieridine displayed reduced chitinase activity, while chitinolytic activity was not inhibited in the insoluble cell fraction. Additionally, confocal microscopy revealed changes in the distribution of chitooligomers in the cryptococcal cell wall, from a polarized to a diffuse cell pattern state. Remarkably, further assays have shown that plumieridine can also inhibit the chitinolytic activity from the supernatant and cell-free extracts of bacteria, insect and mouse-derived macrophage cells (J774.A1). Together, our results suggest that plumieridine can be a broad-spectrum chitinase inhibitor.","Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection caused mainly by the pathogenic yeasts <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> and <i>Cryptococcus gattii</i>.

10.1556/1886.2019.00011,Immune Response in Bacterial and <i>Candida</i> Sepsis.,"Sepsis leads to a systemic immune response, and despite the progress of modern medicine, it is still responsible for a high mortality rate. The immune response to sepsis is dependent on the innate and adaptive immune systems. The first line is the innate system, which requires complex and multiple pathways in order to eliminate the invading threats. The adaptive responses start after the innate response. The cell-mediated arm of CD4+ and CD8+ T and B cells is the main responsible for this response. A coordinated cytokine response is essential for the host immune response. A dysregulated response can lead to a hyperinflammatory condition (cytokine storm). This hyperinflammation leads to neutrophils activation and may also lead to organ dysfunction. An imbalance of this response can increase the anti-inflammatory response, leading to compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS), persistent inflammation-immunsupression, catabolism syndrome (PICS), and, above all, an immune paralysis stat. This immune paralysis leads to opportunistic infections, <i>Candida</i> species being one of the emerging microorganisms involved. The host immune response is different for bacterial or <i>Candida</i> sepsis.

However, the lack of adequate storage facilities results in significant losses of sesame seeds. This study was designed to compare the effects of storage conditions and the subsequent impact on sesame seed germination, mold growth, and mycotoxin accumulation over the storage period. The efficacy of two hermetic bags (1. Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bags and 2. Super GrainPro (SGP) bags) was directly compared to sesame storage in polypropylene (PP bags) and Jute bags. Storage conditions (oxygen, carbon dioxide, temperature, moisture content and relative humidity) of samples were analyzed in the laboratory in three replicates. Results showed that the oxygen concentrations dropped to 6.9% (±0.02) in PICS bags and 8.7% (±0.06) in SGP bags at the end of 6 months of storage. In non-hermetic bags Jute and PP), oxygen levels were close to atmospheric levels at 2-, 4-, and 6-month storage periods. In non-hermetic bags throughout storage, the amount of seed infection by mold constantly increased, and seed germination decreased. Sesame seeds stored in hermetic bags had 89.7% (±0.58) to 88.3% (±2.89) germination rates versus 61.67% (±2.08) for non-hermetic storage bags over the 6-month seed storage period. All mycotoxin levels increased over the same storage period, whereas comparative levels were much lower in hermetic bags after six months. Sesame seeds stored in both hermetic bags had the lowest level of tested mycotoxins, and levels among the SGP and PICS bags were not significantly different from one another. This study provides strong evidence indicating that hermetic storage structures such as PICS and SGP significantly affect temperature, humidity, moisture content, CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen levels resulting in the lowering of fungal growth and mycotoxin accumulation and effectively preserving stored sesame without relying on synthetic pesticides in Ethiopia.","Sesame is an important oil crop for the Ethiopian economy.

Recent studies have demonstrated that dermoscopy can be used to diagnose onychomycosis. We performed this systematic review to identify the characteristic dermoscopic features of onychomycosis and understand their diagnostic utility.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched the Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane databases from conception until May 2021. Studies on the dermoscopic features of onychomycosis were screened. The exclusion criteria were as follows: fewer than 5 cases of onychomycosis, review articles, and studies including onychomycosis cases that were not mycologically verified. Studies on fungal melanonychia were analyzed separately. We adhered to the MOOSE guidelines. Independent data extraction was performed. Data were pooled using a random effects model to account for study heterogeneity. The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of the dermoscopic features of onychomycosis. This was determined by pooling the sensitivity and specificity values of the dermoscopic features identified during the systematic review using the DerSimonian-Laird method.

Functional impairment of CD18, which causes leukocyte adhesion deficiency type-1 results in an immunocompromised state characterized by severe infections, such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). The underlying immune defects have largely been attributed to an impaired migratory and phagocytic activity of polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN). However, the exact contribution of β2-integrins for PMN functions <i>in-vivo</i> has not been elucidated yet, since the mouse models available so far display a constitutive CD18 knockout (CD18<sup>-/-</sup> or CD18<sup>hypo</sup>). To determine the PMN-specific role of β2-integrins for innate effector functions and pathogen control, we generated a mouse line with a Ly6G-specific knockdown of the common β-subunit (CD18<sup>Ly6G</sup> cKO). We characterized CD18<sup>Ly6G</sup> cKO mice <i>in-vitro</i> to confirm the PMN-specific knockdown of β2-integrins. Next, we investigated the clinical course of IPA in <i>A. fumigatus</i> infected CD18<sup>Ly6G</sup> cKO mice with regard to the fungal burden, pulmonary inflammation and PMN response towards <i>A. fumigatus</i>. Our results revealed that the β2-integrin knockdown was restricted to PMN and that CD18<sup>Ly6G</sup> cKO mice showed an aggravated course of IPA. In accordance, we observed a higher fungal burden and lower levels of proinflammatory innate cytokines, such as TNF-α, in lungs of IPA-infected CD18<sup>Ly6G</sup> cKO mice. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed higher levels of CXCL1, a stronger PMN-infiltration, but concomitantly elevated apoptosis of PMN in lungs of CD18<sup>Ly6G</sup> cKO mice. E<i>x-vivo</i> analysis further unveiled a strong impairment of PMN effector function, as reflected by an attenuated phagocytic activity, and a diminished generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil-extracellular traps (NET) in CD18-deficient PMN. Overall, our study demonstrates that β2-integrins are required specifically for PMN effector functions and contribute to the clearance of <i>A. fumigatus</i> by infiltrating PMN, and the establishment of an inflammatory microenvironment in infected lungs.","β2-integrins are heterodimeric surface receptors that are expressed specifically by leukocytes and consist of a variable α (CD11a-d) and a common β-subunit (CD18).

Loaded hydrogels successfully inhibited <i>Candida</i> <i>albicans</i> growth as evident by zone of inhibition and time-kill assays. A significant reduction in retained <i>C. albicans</i> was demonstrated with the hydrogel at 2% <i>Melissa officinalis</i> concentration. This work demonstrated that an essential oil-loaded hydrogel had the potential to provide a novel antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of oral candidiasis.",EuropePMC
10.1038/s41598-021-02718-w,Temperature-dependent modelling and spatial prediction reveal suitable geographical areas for deployment of two Metarhizium anisopliae isolates for Tuta absoluta management.,"Tuta absoluta is one of the most devastating pests of Solanaceae crops in Africa. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of Metarhizium anisopliae isolates ICIPE 18, ICIPE 20 and ICIPE 665 against adult T. absoluta. However, adequate strain selection and accurate spatial prediction are fundamental to optimize their efficacy and formulations before field deployment. This study therefore assessed the thermotolerance, conidial yield and virulence (between 15 and 35 °C) of these potent isolates. Over 90% of conidia germinated at 20, 25 and 30 °C while no germination occurred at 15 °C. Growth of the three isolates occurred at all temperatures, but was slower at 15, 33 and 35 °C as compared to 20, 25 and 30 °C. Optimum temperatures for mycelial growth and spore production were 30 and 25 °C, respectively. Furthermore, ICIPE 18 produced higher amount of spores than ICIPE 20 and ICIPE 665. The highest mortality occurred at 30 °C for all the three isolates, while the LT<sub>50</sub> values of ICIPE 18 and ICIPE 20 were significantly lower at 25 and 30 °C compared to those of ICIPE 665. Subsequently, several nonlinear equations were fitted to the mortality data to model the virulence of ICIPE 18 and ICIPE 20 against adult T. absoluta using the Entomopathogenic Fungi Application (EPFA) software. Spatial prediction revealed suitable locations for ICIPE 18 and ICIPE 20 deployment against T. absoluta in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Our findings suggest that ICIPE 18 and ICIPE 20 could be considered as effective candidate biopesticides for an improved T. absoluta management based on temperature and location-specific approach.","Tuta absoluta is one of the most devastating pests of Solanaceae crops in Africa.

Physiological data can improve interpretation of predicted distributions and can be used in directed distribution models. Nonnative species provide useful case studies. Panther chameleons (Furcifer pardalis) are native to Madagascar and have established populations in Florida, USA, but standard correlative distribution modeling predicts no suitable habitat for F. pardalis there. We evaluated commonly collected thermal traits- thermal performance, tolerance, and preference-of F. pardalis and the acclimatization potential of these traits during exposure to naturally-occurring environmental conditions in North Central Florida. Though we observed temperature-dependent thermal performance, chameleons maintained similar thermal limits, performance, and preferences across seasons, despite long-term exposure to cool temperatures. Using the physiological data collected, we developed distribution models that varied in restriction: time-dependent exposure near and below critical thermal minima, predicted activity windows, and predicted performance thresholds. Our application of commonly collected physiological data improved interpretations on potential distributions of F. pardalis, compared with correlative distribution modeling approaches that predicted no suitable area in Florida. These straightforward approaches can be applied to other species with existing physiological data or after brief experiments on a limited number of individuals, as demonstrated here.","Predicting potential distributions of species in new areas is challenging.

10.7554/elife.85410,Neural mechanisms of parasite-induced summiting behavior in 'zombie' <i>Drosophila</i>.,"For at least two centuries, scientists have been enthralled by the ""zombie"" behaviors induced by mind-controlling parasites. Despite this interest, the mechanistic bases of these uncanny processes have remained mostly a mystery. Here, we leverage the <i>Entomophthora muscae</i>-<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> ""zombie fly"" system to reveal the mechanistic underpinnings of summit disease, a manipulated behavior evoked by many fungal parasites. Using a high-throughput approach to measure summiting, we discovered that summiting behavior is characterized by a burst of locomotion and requires the host circadian and neurosecretory systems, specifically DN1p circadian neurons, pars intercerebralis to corpora allata projecting (PI-CA) neurons and corpora allata (CA), the latter being solely responsible for juvenile hormone (JH) synthesis and release. Using a machine learning classifier to identify summiting animals in real time, we observed that PI-CA neurons and CA appeared intact in summiting animals, despite invasion of adjacent regions of the ""zombie fly"" brain by <i>E. muscae</i> cells and extensive host tissue damage in the body cavity. The blood-brain barrier of flies late in their infection was significantly permeabilized, suggesting that factors in the hemolymph may have greater access to the central nervous system during summiting. Metabolomic analysis of hemolymph from summiting flies revealed differential abundance of several compounds compared to non-summiting flies. Transfusing the hemolymph of summiting flies into non-summiting recipients induced a burst of locomotion, demonstrating that factor(s) in the hemolymph likely cause summiting behavior. Altogether, our work reveals a neuro-mechanistic model for summiting wherein fungal cells perturb the fly's hemolymph, activating a neurohormonal pathway linking clock neurons to juvenile hormone production in the CA, ultimately inducing locomotor activity in their host.","For at least two centuries, scientists have been enthralled by the ""zombie"" behaviors induced by mind-controlling parasites.

Mucormycosis is typically seen in immunocompromised patients, but has been increasingly documented in previously healthy trauma patients. Mortality due to these infections can be high due to delayed diagnosis from a subtle clinical presentation and spread of infection by angioinvasion. Early recognition and prompt treatment is critical for survival. We describe a case of invasive mucormycosis in a previously healthy trauma patient treated at a Level 1 trauma center.<h4>Case report</h4>A 22-year-old male presented to the hospital after being involved in a motor vehicle accident. He sustained multiple traumatic injuries and developed multi-system organ failure within 48 hours of admission. He developed invasive, soft tissue mucormycosis (<i>Rhizopus</i> sp) at the laparotomy site, requiring multiple surgical debridements and prompt antifungal therapy. The fungus was also cultured from respiratory secretions and likely associated with his abdominal infection. We suspect the patient was predisposed to an invasive fungal infection in the setting of multi-system organ failure and multiple blood transfusions. The patient ultimately did well and continued to improve on follow up in the outpatient setting.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Mucormycosis is a rare infection that has been increasingly documented in trauma patients. Early recognition together with prompt debridement and antifungal therapy is key to successful management. Understanding risk factors for post-traumatic mucormycosis should raise our index of suspicion and prompt early diagnosis and initiation of treatment. Aggressive debridement is a critical component of appropriate management due to the angioinvasive spread of the mucor fungi. This means frequent debridement beyond the demarcation of gangrenous tissue. The management of our patient demonstrates the importance of early recognition of the clinical presentation, prompt initiation of antifungal therapy, and aggressive debridement of the wound.","<h4>Background</h4><i>Mucor</i> fungi are found ubiquitously in the environment and rarely cause infections in humans.

Several studies on the reaction of apple plants to ARD are documented but less is known about the genetic mechanisms behind this symptomatology. RNA-seq analysis is a powerful tool for revealing candidate genes that are involved in the molecular responses to biotic stresses in plants. The aim of our work was to find differentially expressed genes in response to ARD in <i>Malus.</i> For this, we compared transcriptome data of the rootstock 'M9' (susceptible) and the wild apple genotype <i>M.</i> ×<i>robusta</i> 5 (Mr5, tolerant) after cultivation in ARD soil and disinfected ARD soil, respectively. When comparing apple plantlets grown in ARD soil to those grown in disinfected ARD soil, 1,206 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified based on a log2 fold change, (LFC) ≥ 1 for up- and ≤ -1 for downregulation (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Subsequent validation revealed a highly significant positive correlation (<i>r</i> = 0.91; <i>p</i> < 0.0001) between RNA-seq and RT-qPCR results indicating a high reliability of the RNA-seq data. PageMan analysis showed that transcripts of genes involved in gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis were significantly enriched in the DEG dataset. Most of these GA biosynthesis genes were associated with functions in cell wall stabilization. Further genes were related to detoxification processes. Genes of both groups were expressed significantly higher in Mr5, suggesting that the lower susceptibility to ARD in Mr5 is not due to a single mechanism. These findings contribute to a better insight into ARD response in susceptible and tolerant apple genotypes.

High-throughput drug screening and in-depth drug action mechanism analyzation are needed to address this problem.

10.3390/plants10122574,Proteomics and Interspecies Interaction Analysis Revealed Abscisic Acid Signalling to Be the Primary Driver for Oil Palm's Response against Red Palm Weevil Infestation.,"The red palm weevil (RPW; <i>Rhynchophorus ferrugineus</i> Olivier (Coleoptera Curculionidae)) is an invasive insect pest that is difficult to manage due to its nature of infesting the host palm trees from within. A holistic, molecular-based approach to identify proteins that correlate with RPW infestation could give useful insights into the vital processes that are prevalent to the host's infestation response and identify the potential biomarkers for an early detection technique. Here, a shotgun proteomic analysis was performed on oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>; OP) under untreated (control), wounding by drilling (wounded), and artificial larval infestation (infested) conditions at three different time points to characterise the RPW infestation response at three different stages. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed many overlapping pathways between the control, wounded, and infested groups. Further analysis via literature searches narrowed down biologically relevant proteins into categories, which were photosynthesis, growth, and stress response. Overall, the patterns of protein expression suggested abscisic acid (ABA) hormone signalling to be the primary driver of insect herbivory response. Interspecies molecular docking analysis between RPW ligands and OP receptor proteins provided putative interactions that result in ABA signalling activation. Seven proteins were selected as candidate biomarkers for early infestation detection based on their relevance and association with ABA signalling. The MS data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD028986. This study provided a deeper insight into the mechanism of stress response in OP in order to develop a novel detection method or improve crop management.","The red palm weevil (RPW; <i>Rhynchophorus ferrugineus</i> Olivier (Coleoptera Curculionidae)) is an invasive insect pest that is difficult to manage due to its nature of infesting the host palm trees from within.

Pooled estimates of the infection prevalence and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random-effects models.<h4>Results</h4>We found that pneumonia (67.7%) was the most prevalent infection followed by upper respiratory tract (59.0%) and gastrointestinal infections (36.3%). Furthermore, bacterial complications (41.7%) were higher in CVID patients compared to viral (25.4%), parasitic (18.8%), or fungal (3.4%) infections. Patients with longer age at diagnosis presented with fewer disease comorbidities. There was an inverse correlation between T lymphocyte count and viral infections. Moreover, we found that immunoglobulin M (IgM) serum level was inversely correlated with hepatitis C and gastrointestinal infections, and IgG serum level was inversely correlated with infectious arthritis. Higher numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells were associated with the lower frequencies of otitis media. CVID patients with infections had significantly lower percentages of CD3 T cells. In contrast, higher percentages of CD19 lymphocytes were found in CVID patients who had a history of infections.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings demonstrated that in addition to hypogammaglobulinemia, patients with CVID have an imbalance in the frequency of T lymphocytes, which is in parallel with the higher frequency of infectious complications.","<h4>Objectives</h4>Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia and increased susceptibility to recurrent infections.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases to find eligible studies from the earliest available date to January 2018 with standard keywords.

However, the role of PD-L1 on neutrophil-mediated antifungal immunity remains wholly unknown. Here, we show that the expression of PD-L1 on murine and human neutrophils was upregulated upon the engagement of C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1 with its ligand β-glucans, exposed on fungal pathogen Candida albicans yeast. Moreover, β-glucan stimulation induced PD-L1 translocation into nucleus to regulate the production of chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2, which control neutrophil mobilization. Importantly, C. albicans infection-induced expression of PD-L1 leads to neutrophil accumulation in bone marrow, through mediating their autocrine secretion of CXCL1/2. Furthermore, neutrophil-specific deficiency of PD-L1 impaired CXCL1/2 secretion, which promoted neutrophil migration from bone marrow into the peripheral circulation, thereby conferring host resistance to C. albicans infection. Finally, either PD-L1 blockade or pharmacological inhibition of PD-L1 expression significantly increased neutrophil release from bone marrow to enhance host antifungal immunity. Our data together indicate that activation of Dectin-1/PD-L1 cascade by β-glucans inhibits neutrophil release from bone marrow reserve, contributing to the negative regulation of antifungal innate immunity, which functions as a potent immunotherapeutic target against life-threatening fungi infections.","Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) has been shown to be inducibly expressed on neutrophils to suppress host immunity during polymicrobial sepsis, virus and parasite infections.

10.1007/s00248-018-1158-4,A Crispy Diet: Grazers of Achromatium oxaliferum in Lake Stechlin Sediments.,"Achromatium is the largest freshwater bacterium known to date and easily recognised by conspicuous calcite bodies filling the cell volume. Members of this genus are highly abundant in diverse aquatic sediments and may account for up to 90% of the bacterial biovolume in the oxic-anoxic interfaces. The high abundance implies that Achromatium is either rapidly growing or hardly prone to predation. As Achromatium is still uncultivated and does not appear to grow fast, one could assume that the cells might escape predation by their unusual shape and composition. However, we observed various members of the meiofauna grazing or parasitizing on Achromatium. By microphotography, we documented amoebae, ciliates, oligochetes and plathelminthes having Achromatium cells ingested. Some Achromatium cells harboured structures resembling sporangia of parasitic fungi (chytrids) that could be stained with the chitin-specific dye Calcofluor White. Many Achromatia carried prokaryotic epibionts in the slime layer surrounding the cells. Their regular distribution over the cell might indicate that they are commensalistic rather than harming their hosts. In conclusion, we report on various interactions of Achromatium with the sediment community and show that although Achromatium cells are a crispy diet, full of calcite bodies, predators do not spare them.","Achromatium is the largest freshwater bacterium known to date and easily recognised by conspicuous calcite bodies filling the cell volume.

By microphotography, we documented amoebae, ciliates, oligochetes and plathelminthes having Achromatium cells ingested. Some Achromatium cells harboured structures resembling sporangia of parasitic fungi (chytrids) that could be stained with the chitin-specific dye Calcofluor White. Many Achromatia carried prokaryotic epibionts in the slime layer surrounding the cells. Their regular distribution over the cell might indicate that they are commensalistic rather than harming their hosts. In conclusion, we report on various interactions of Achromatium with the sediment community and show that although Achromatium cells are a crispy diet, full of calcite bodies, predators do not spare them.",EuropePMC
10.3389/fpls.2021.646147,Heat Shock Protein HSP24 Is Involved in the BABA-Induced Resistance to Fungal Pathogen in Postharvest Grapes Underlying an NPR1-Dependent Manner.,"Although heat shock proteins (HSPs), a family of ubiquitous molecular chaperones, are well characterized in heat stress-related responses, their function in plant defense remains largely unclear. Here, we report the role of <i>VvHSP24</i>, a class B HSP from <i>Vitis vinifera</i>, in β-aminobutyric acid (BABA)-induced priming defense against the necrotrophic fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> in grapes. Grapes treated with 10 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> BABA exhibited transiently increased transcript levels of <i>VvNPR1</i> and several SA-inducible genes, including <i>PR1</i>, <i>PR2</i>, and <i>PR5</i>. Additionally, phytoalexins accumulated upon inoculation with the gray mold fungus <i>B. cinerea</i>, which coincided with the action of a priming mode implicated in pathogen-driven resistance. Intriguingly, electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA), yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and His pull-down assays demonstrated that the nuclear chaperone <i>VvHSP24</i> cannot modulate the transcript of <i>PR</i> genes but does directly interact with <i>VvNPR1 in vivo</i> or <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, we found that <i>VvHSP24</i> overexpression enhanced the transcript levels of NPR1 and SA-responsive genes (<i>PR1</i>, <i>PR2</i>, and <i>PR5</i>) and increased the resistance of transgenic <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to <i>B. cinerea</i> compared with wildtype Col-0. An opposite trend between CRISPR mutants of <i>AtHSFB1</i> (the orthologous gene of <i>VvHSP24</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i>) and wildtype plants was observed. Hence, our results suggest that <i>VvHSP24</i> has a potential role in NPR1-dependent plant resistance to fungal pathogen. BABA-induced priming defense in grapes may require posttranslational modification of the chaperone <i>VvHSP24</i> to activate <i>VvNPR1</i> transcript, leading to <i>PR</i> gene expressions and resistance phenotypes.","Although heat shock proteins (HSPs), a family of ubiquitous molecular chaperones, are well characterized in heat stress-related responses, their function in plant defense remains largely unclear.

Randomized trials comparing any ICI alone, with chemotherapy (CT), or with other agents versus placebo, CT, or other agents were included. Three independent reviewers extracted the data. The primary outcome was the RR of all-grade (G) and G3-5 infections for patients receiving ICI-based treatments. Random or fixed-effect models were used according to statistical heterogeneity.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 21,451 patients from N = 36 studies were eligible. ICIs were associated with a similar risk of all-grade infections (RR = 1.02; 95% CI 0.84-1.24; P = 0.85) versus non-ICI treatments (G1-5 events: 9.6 versus 8.3%). When the ICIs alone were compared to CT, their use was associated with 42% less risk of all-grade infections (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.4-0.85; P = 0.01).

Nonetheless, the trade-off between these lipid functions is still poorly understood. The migratory locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i> and the Italian locust <i>Calliptamus italicus</i> have dissimilar hygrothermal preferences: <i>L. migratoria</i> inhabits areas near water bodies with a reed bed, and <i>C. italicus</i> exploits a wide range of habitats and prefers steppes and semideserts with the predominance of sagebrushes. This paper presents significant differences between these species' nymphs in epicuticular lipid composition (according to gas chromatography with mass spectrometry) and in susceptibility to <i>Metarhizium robertsii</i> and <i>Beauveria bassiana</i>. The main differences in lipid composition are shifts to longer chain and branched hydrocarbons (di- and trimethylalkanes) in <i>C. italicus</i> compared to <i>L. migratoria</i>. <i>C. italicus</i> also has a slightly higher <i>n</i>-alkane content. Fatty acids showed low concentrations in the extracts, and <i>L. migratoria</i> has a wider range of fatty acids than <i>C. italicus</i> does. Susceptibility to <i>M. robertsii</i> and the number of conidia adhering to the cuticle proved to be significantly higher in <i>C. italicus</i>, although conidia germination percentages on epicuticular extracts did not differ between the species.

Nutrient exchange must be dynamically controlled to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship between the two symbiotic partners. The WRI5a and its homologues play a conserved role in lipid supply to AMF. Here, we demonstrate that the AP2/ERF transcription factor MtERM1 binds directly to AW-box and AW-box-like cis-elements in the promoters of MtSTR2 and MtSTR, which are required for host lipid efflux and arbuscule development. The EAR domain-containing transcription factor MtERF12 is also directly activated by MtERM1/MtWRI5a to negatively regulate arbuscule development, and the TOPLESS co-repressor is further recruited by MtERF12 through EAR motif to oppose MtERM1/MtWRI5a function, thereby suppressing arbuscule development. We therefore reveal an ERM1/WRI5a-ERF12-TOPLESS negative feedback loop that enables plants to flexibly control nutrient exchange and ensure a mutually beneficial symbiosis.","Most terrestrial plants establish a symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which provide them with lipids and sugars in exchange for phosphorus and nitrogen.

10.1128/mbio.00285-23,Cytosolic pH Controls Fungal MAPK Signaling and Pathogenicity.,"Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) regulate a variety of cellular processes in eukaryotes. In fungal pathogens, conserved MAPK pathways control key virulence functions such as infection-related development, invasive hyphal growth, or cell wall remodeling. Recent findings suggest that ambient pH acts as a key regulator of MAPK-mediated pathogenicity, but the underlying molecular events are unknown. Here, we found that in the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum, pH controls another infection-related process, hyphal chemotropism. Using the ratiometric pH sensor pHluorin we show that fluctuations in cytosolic pH (pH<sub>c</sub>) induce rapid reprogramming of the three conserved MAPKs in F. oxysporum, and that this response is conserved in the fungal model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Screening of a subset of S. cerevisiae mutants identified the sphingolipid-regulated AGC kinase Ypk1/2 as a key upstream component of pH<sub>c</sub>-modulated MAPK responses. We further show that acidification of the cytosol in F. oxysporum leads to an increase of the long-chain base (LCB) sphingolipid dihydrosphingosine (dhSph) and that exogenous addition of dhSph activates Mpk1 phosphorylation and chemotropic growth. Our results reveal a pivotal role of pH<sub>c</sub> in the regulation of MAPK signaling and suggest new ways to target fungal growth and pathogenicity. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Fungal phytopathogens cause devastating losses in global agriculture.

10.3390/molecules27051612,Exploring the Volatiles Released from Roots of Wild and Domesticated Tomato Plants under Insect Attack.,"Plants produce volatile organic compounds that are important in communication and defense. While studies have largely focused on volatiles emitted from aboveground plant parts upon exposure to biotic or abiotic stresses, volatile emissions from roots upon aboveground stress are less studied. Here, we investigated if tomato plants under insect herbivore attack exhibited a different root volatilome than non-stressed plants, and whether this was influenced by the plant's genetic background. To this end, we analyzed one domesticated and one wild tomato species, i.e., <i>Solanum lycopersicum cv</i> Moneymaker and <i>Solanum pimpinellifolium,</i> respectively, exposed to leaf herbivory by the insect <i>Spodoptera exigua.</i> Root volatiles were trapped with two sorbent materials, HiSorb and PDMS, at 24 h after exposure to insect stress. Our results revealed that differences in root volatilome were species-, stress-, and material-dependent. Upon leaf herbivory, the domesticated and wild tomato species showed different root volatile profiles. The wild species presented the largest change in root volatile compounds with an overall reduction in monoterpene emission under stress. Similarly, the domesticated species presented a slight reduction in monoterpene emission and an increased production of fatty-acid-derived volatiles under stress. Volatile profiles differed between the two sorbent materials, and both were required to obtain a more comprehensive characterization of the root volatilome. Collectively, these results provide a strong basis to further unravel the impact of herbivory stress on systemic volatile emissions.","Plants produce volatile organic compounds that are important in communication and defense.

Upon leaf herbivory, the domesticated and wild tomato species showed different root volatile profiles. The wild species presented the largest change in root volatile compounds with an overall reduction in monoterpene emission under stress. Similarly, the domesticated species presented a slight reduction in monoterpene emission and an increased production of fatty-acid-derived volatiles under stress. Volatile profiles differed between the two sorbent materials, and both were required to obtain a more comprehensive characterization of the root volatilome. Collectively, these results provide a strong basis to further unravel the impact of herbivory stress on systemic volatile emissions.",EuropePMC

Herein, we describe HIV-associated morbidity among hospitalised HIV/AIDS patients with advanced immunosuppression and assess the comorbidities, laboratory parameters, and immunological markers associated with mortality.<h4>Methods</h4>The cross-sectional study was conducted at the Fundação de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD) in Manaus, Brazil. In all, 83 participants aged between 12 and 70 years were enrolled by convenience within 72 h of their hospitalisation. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from electronic medical records. We prospectively measured the cytokines Th1/Th2/Th17 and inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-1β, and IL-12 using cytometric bead array, and the soluble CD14 using in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.<h4>Results</h4>The HIV/AIDS inpatients presented a scenario of respiratory syndromes as the most prevalent comorbidity. Almost all patients had CD4 T counts below 350 cells/mL and the mortality rate was 20.5%. Pulmonary tuberculosis, neurotoxoplasmosis and oropharyngeal-esophageal candidiasis were the most prevalent opportunistic infections. TB and weight loss were more prevalent in HIV/AIDS inpatients who died. The Mann Whitney analysis showed that those who died had higher platelet distribution width (PDW) on admission, which is suggestive for platelet activation. The Poisson multivariate analysis showed the prevalence of TB, digestive syndrome and increases in IL-8 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) associated to death.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The advanced immunosuppression characterized by the opportunistic infections presented in these HIV/AIDS inpatients was the major factor of mortality. The role of platelet activation in worse outcomes of hospitalisation and the IL-8 associated with the context of advanced immunosuppression may be promising markers in the prediction of mortality in HIV/AIDS patients.","<h4>Background</h4>The irregular use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and late diagnosis still account for a large part of HIV-associated mortality in people living with HIV (PLHIV).

The development of γδT cells in the thymus requires γδT cell receptor (γδTCR) signaling mediated by the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) family proteins, Syk and Zap70. Here, we show a critical role of Syk in the early phase of γδT cell development using mice deficient for Syk specifically in lymphoid lineage cells (Syk-conditional knockout (cKO) mice). The development of γδT cells in the Syk-cKO mice was arrested at the precursor stage where the expression of Rag genes and αβT-lineage-associated genes were retained, indicating that Syk is required for γδT-cell lineage commitment. Loss of Syk in γδT cells weakened TCR signal-induced phosphorylation of Erk and Akt, which is mandatory for the thymic development of γδT17 cells. Syk-cKO mice exhibited a loss of γδT17 cells in the thymus as well as throughout the body, and thereby are protected from γδT17-dependent psoriasis-like skin inflammation. Collectively, our results indicate that Syk is a key player in the lineage commitment of γδT cells and the priming of γδT17 cell differentiation.","The γδT cells that produce IL-17 (γδT17 cells) play a key role in various pathophysiologic processes in host defense and homeostasis.

10.1186/s10020-022-00515-3,Neutrophil trogocytosis during their trans-endothelial migration: role of extracellular CIRP.,"<h4>Background</h4>Neutrophils are the most abundant innate immune cells in the circulating blood, and they act as the first responder against bacterial and fungal infection. However, accumulation of activated neutrophils can cause severe inflammation and tissue damage. Recently, neutrophil trogocytosis or membrane transfer with neighboring cells was reported to modulate immune responses. Extracellular cold-inducible RNA binding protein (eCIRP) is a newly identified damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP). eCIRP can activate neutrophils to be more pro-inflammatory. This study aimed to identify the role of eCIRP in neutrophil trogocytosis during their trans-endothelial migration.<h4>Methods</h4>A trans-endothelial migration (TEM) assay using bone marrow neutrophils and mouse primary lung vascular endothelial cells was conducted using transwell chambers and neutrophil trogocytosis was assessed in vitro. In an in vivo mouse model of acute lung injury, neutrophil trogocytosis was assessed from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.<h4>Results</h4>In TEM assay, the trogocytosis of neutrophils occurred during trans-endothelial migration and eCIRP significantly increased the percentage of these neutrophils. The trogocytosed neutrophils acquired the endothelial membrane containing junctional adhesion molecule-C (JAM-C) and VE-cadherin, and these membrane patches were polarized by Mac-1 binding. Furthermore, eCIRP-induced JAM-C positive trogocytosed neutrophils are more pro-inflammatory than the JAM-C negative counterpart. JAM-C positive trogocytosed neutrophils were also observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a mouse model of acute lung injury.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These data suggest that during the paracellular trans-endothelial migration of neutrophils in response to inflammation, eCIRP induces trogocytosis of neutrophils, and the trogocytosed neutrophils exhibit an exaggerated pro-inflammatory phenotype promoting acute lung injury.","<h4>Background</h4>Neutrophils are the most abundant innate immune cells in the circulating blood, and they act as the first responder against bacterial and fungal infection.

10.3390/nano11020311,Recent Advances in Nanosystems and Strategies for Vaginal Delivery of Antimicrobials.,"Vaginal infections such as bacterial vaginosis (BV), chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, candidiasis, and trichomoniasis affect millions of women each year. They are caused by an overgrowth of microorganisms, generally sexually transmitted, which in turn can be favored by alterations in the vaginal flora. Conventional treatments of these infections consist in systemic or local antimicrobial therapies. However, in the attempt to reduce adverse effects and to contrast microbial resistance and infection recurrences, many efforts have been devoted to the development of vaginal systems for the local delivery of antimicrobials. Several topical dosage forms such as aerosols, lotions, suppositories, tablets, gels, and creams have been proposed, although they are sometimes ineffective due to their poor penetration and rapid removal from the vaginal canal. For these reasons, the development of innovative drug delivery systems, able to remain in situ and release active agents for a prolonged period, is becoming more and more important. Among all, nanosystems such as liposomes, nanoparticles (NPs), and micelles with tunable surface properties, but also thermogelling nanocomposites, could be exploited to improve local drug delivery, biodistribution, retention, and uptake in vulvovaginal tissues. The aim of this review is to provide a survey of the variety of nanoplatforms developed for the vaginal delivery of antimicrobial agents. A concise summary of the most common vaginal infections and of the conventional therapies is also provided.","Vaginal infections such as bacterial vaginosis (BV), chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, candidiasis, and trichomoniasis affect millions of women each year.

Different N forms affect plant defense against foliar pathogens and may alter soil-plant-microbe interactions. To date, however, the complex relationships between N forms and host defense are poorly understood. For this purpose, nitrate, ammonium, and cyanamide were compared in greenhouse pot trials with the aim to suppress two important fungal wheat pathogens <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Bgt</i>) and <i>Gaeumannomyces graminis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Ggt</i>). Wheat inoculated with the foliar pathogen <i>Bgt</i> was comparatively up to 80% less infested when fertilized with nitrate or cyanamide than with ammonium. Likewise, soil inoculation with the fungal pathogen <i>Ggt</i> revealed a 38% higher percentage of take-all infected roots in ammonium-fertilized plants. The bacterial rhizosphere microbiome was little affected by the N form, whereas the fungal community composition and structure were shaped by the different N fertilization, as revealed from metabarcoding data. Importantly, we observed a higher abundance of fungal pathogenic taxa in the ammonium-fertilized treatment compared to the other N treatments. Taken together, our findings demonstrated the critical role of fertilized N forms for host-pathogen interactions and wheat rhizosphere microbiome assemblage, which are relevant for plant fitness and performance.","Nitrogen (N) fertilization is indispensable for high yields in agriculture due to its central role in plant growth and fitness.

The aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial behavior of thiazole coumarin derivatives through in vitro and in silico studies. All the compounds showed activity against both antibacterial strains, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, except <b>5d</b> . Similarly, the compounds <b>5a</b> , <b>5b</b> , and <b>5d</b> were found to be active against Trichoderma harzianum. The compound <b>5d</b> of this series was found to have a higher activity with MIC 125 mg/ml against Trichoderma harzianum. Molecular studies showed the high activities of these compounds are due to the presence of strong H-bonding and π-π interaction with their respective targets. A good correlation was observed between computational and in vitro studies.",EuropePMC

Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that may cause several CNS manifestations, especially in immunocompromised patients. Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common type of involvement. Mass-effect lesions are uncommon: they are described as cryptococcomas and their prevalence is even lower among immunocompetent patients. The aim here was to report an extremely rare case of cryptococcoma causing a mass effect and mimicking a brain tumor in an immunocompetent patient. The literature on CNS cryptococcal infections was reviewed with emphasis on cryptococcomas. Clinical, surgical and radiological data on a female patient with this rare presentation of cryptococcoma mimicking a brain tumor are described.<h4>Case report</h4>A 54-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with a rapid-onset progressive history of confusion and completely dependency for basic activities. Neuroimaging showed a left occipital lesion and neurosurgical treatment was proposed. From histopathological evaluation, a diagnosis of cryptococcoma was established. She received clinical support with antifungals, but despite optimal clinical treatment, her condition evolved to death.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Cryptococcal infections have several forms of presentation and, in immunocompetent patients, their manifestation may be even more different. Cryptococcoma is an extremely rare presentation in which proper surgical and clinical treatment should be instituted as quickly as possible, but even so, there is a high mortality rate.","<h4>Context</h4>Central nervous system (CNS) infectious diseases have high prevalence in developing countries and their proper diagnosis and treatment are very important for public health planning.

10.3390/insects13030257,ddRAD Sequencing Identifies Pesticide Resistance-Related Loci and Reveals New Insights into Genetic Structure of <i>Bactericera cockerelli</i> as a Plant Pathogen Vector.,"(1) Background: Many hemipteran insects transmit plant pathogens that cause devastating crop diseases, while pest management frequently relies primarily on insecticide applications. These intense insecticide applications lead to the development of insecticide resistance, as was the case for potato psyllid, <i>Bactericera cockerelli</i> (Hemiptera: Triozidae), a vector of <i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter solanacearum, which causes zebra chip disease in potato. (2) Methods: Here, we use double-digest restriction site-associated DNA (ddRAD) to genotype eight psyllid populations (one susceptible and seven resistant to neonicotinoid insecticides). (3) Results: Association tests identified over 400 loci that were strongly segregated between susceptible and resistant populations. Several loci were located within genes involved in insecticide resistance, gene regulation, fertility, and development. Moreover, we explored the genetic structure of these eight populations and discovered that routinely utilized haplotyping was not an accurate predictor of population structure. Pairwise comparisons of the fixation index (<i>F</i><sub>ST</sub>) of populations of the same haplotype were not different from pairwise <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> of populations that belonged to different haplotypes. (4) Conclusions: Our findings suggest that neonicotinoid insecticide resistance has a genetic basis, most likely as a result of similar selection pressure. Furthermore, our results imply that using a single maternally inherited gene marker to designate genetic lineages for potato psyllids should be re-evaluated.","(1) Background: Many hemipteran insects transmit plant pathogens that cause devastating crop diseases, while pest management frequently relies primarily on insecticide applications.

This article introduces the characteristics of synchrotron X-ray imaging and its applications in agriculture and food science research. The agriculture and food sector are a vast area that comprises of plants, seeds, animals, food and their products; soils with thriving microbial communities; and natural resources such as water, fertilizers, and organic matter. These entities have unique internal features, structures and compositions which differentiate them from each other in varieties, species, grades, and types. The use of a bright and tuneable monochromatic source of synchrotron imaging techniques enables researchers to study the internal features and compositions of plants, seeds, soil and food in a quick and non-destructive way to enhance their use, conservation and productivity. Synchrotron's different X-ray imaging techniques offer a wide domain of applications, which make them perfect to enhance the understanding of structures of raw and processed food products to promote food safety and security. Therefore, this paper summarizes the results of major experiments carried out with seeds, plants, soil, food and relevant areas of agricultural sciences with more emphasis on two synchrotron X-ray imaging techniques: absorption and phase-contrast imaging and computed tomography.","Synchrotron imaging is widely used for research in many scientific disciplines.

10.1186/s12864-019-6417-3,The transcriptomic signature of low aggression in honey bees resembles a response to infection.,"<h4>Background</h4>Behavior reflects an organism's health status. Many organisms display a generalized suite of behaviors that indicate infection or predict infection susceptibility. We apply this concept to honey bee aggression, a behavior that has been associated with positive health outcomes in previous studies. We sequenced the transcriptomes of the brain, fat body, and midgut of adult sibling worker bees who developed as pre-adults in relatively high versus low aggression colonies. Previous studies showed that this pre-adult experience impacts both aggressive behavior and resilience to pesticides. We performed enrichment analyses on differentially expressed genes to determine whether variation in aggression resembles the molecular response to infection. We further assessed whether the transcriptomic signature of aggression in the brain is similar to the neuromolecular response to acute predator threat, exposure to a high-aggression environment as an adult, or adult behavioral maturation.<h4>Results</h4>Across all three tissues assessed, genes that are differentially expressed as a function of aggression significantly overlap with genes whose expression is modulated by a variety of pathogens and parasitic feeding. In the fat body, and to some degree the midgut, our data specifically support the hypothesis that low aggression resembles a diseased or parasitized state. However, we find little evidence of active infection in individuals from the low aggression group. We also find little evidence that the brain molecular signature of aggression is enriched for genes modulated by social cues that induce aggression in adults. However, we do find evidence that genes associated with adult behavioral maturation are enriched in our brain samples.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Results support the hypothesis that low aggression resembles a molecular state of infection. This pattern is most robust in the peripheral fat body, an immune responsive tissue in the honey bee. We find no evidence of acute infection in bees from the low aggression group, suggesting the physiological state characterizing low aggression may instead predispose bees to negative health outcomes when they are exposed to additional stressors. The similarity of molecular signatures associated with the seemingly disparate traits of aggression and disease suggests that these characteristics may, in fact, be intimately tied.","<h4>Background</h4>Behavior reflects an organism's health status.

More recently, apoE-derived peptides have been shown to exert antimicrobial effects. Here, we investigated the antibacterial activity of apoE using in vitro assays, advanced imaging techniques, and in vivo mouse models. The formation of macromolecular complexes of apoE and endotoxins from Gram-negative bacteria was explored using gel shift assays, transmission electron microscopy, and CD spectroscopy followed by calculation of the α-helical content. The binding affinity of apoE to endotoxins was also confirmed by fluorescent spectroscopy detecting the quenching and shifting of tryptophan intrinsic fluorescence. We showed that apoE exhibits antibacterial activity particularly against Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. ApoE protein folding was affected by binding of bacterial endotoxin components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipid A, yielding similar increases in the apoE α-helical content. Moreover, high-molecular-weight complexes of apoE were formed in the presence of LPS, but not to the same extent as with lipid A. Together, our results demonstrate the ability of apoE to kill Gram-negative bacteria, interact with their endotoxins, which leads to the structural changes in apoE and the formation of aggregate-like complexes.","ApoE is a well-known lipid-binding protein that plays a main role in the metabolism and transport of lipids.

Topically applied C8:0 was more toxic to adults than larvae (LD100 for adults 18.33 ± 2.49 vs. 33.56 ± 2.57 µg/mg of body mass for larvae). The administration of C8:0 on the cuticle of larvae and adults, in amounts corresponding to their LD50 and LD100 doses, had a considerable impact on the two main defense systems engaged in protecting against pathogens, causing serious changes in the developmental-stage-specific profiles of free fatty acids (FFAs) covering the cuticle of larvae and adults and damaging larval hemocytes. In vitro cultures of <i>G. mellonella</i> hemocytes, either directly treated with C8:0 or taken from C8:0 treated larvae, revealed deformation of hemocytes, disordered networking, late apoptosis, and necrosis, as well as caspase 1-9 activation and elevation of 8-OHdG level. C8:0 was also confirmed to have a cytotoxic effect on the SF-9 insect cell line, as determined by WST-1 and LDH tests.",EuropePMC

The glucan-rich cell wall of A. fumigatus is a protective structure that is absent from human cells and is a potential target for antifungal treatments. Glucan is synthesized from the donor uridine diphosphate glucose, with the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose-1-phosphate by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase (PGM) representing a key step in its biosynthesis. Here, we explore the possibility of selectively targeting A. fumigatus PGM (AfPGM) as an antifungal treatment strategy. Using a promoter replacement strategy, we constructed a conditional pgm mutant and revealed that pgm is required for A. fumigatus growth and cell wall integrity. In addition, using a fragment screen, we identified the thiol-reactive compound isothiazolone fragment of PGM as targeting a cysteine residue not conserved in the human ortholog. Furthermore, through scaffold exploration, we synthesized a para-aryl derivative (ISFP10) and demonstrated that it inhibits AfPGM with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2 μM and exhibits 50-fold selectivity over the human enzyme. Taken together, our data provide genetic validation of PGM as a therapeutic target and suggest new avenues for inhibiting AfPGM using covalent inhibitors that could serve as tools for chemical validation.","Aspergillus fumigatus is the causative agent of invasive aspergillosis, an infection with mortality rates of up to 50%.

10.7717/peerj.7632,Effects of <i>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</i> infection on the immune response of rabbits.,"<h4>Background</h4>Rabbit breeding has developed into a large-scale industry, and as such, the incidence of dermatophytosis in rabbits has become increasingly common. A rabbit model with <i>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</i> infection was established to study the changes within the immune responses after fungal infection.<h4>Methods</h4>After the <i>T. mentagrophytes</i> challenge on skin, pathogens on the skin were isolated from the rabbits in the fungal infection (FI) groups 20 days. Fungal observation under microscope were carried out. Identification of strains was achieved by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the CDR1 gene. The collected anticoagulant blood samples were analyzed for various blood cell parameters. The levels of antibodies, including IgM and IgA, cytokines, including IL-2, IL-6, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and soluble CD4 and CD8 in the serum of the FI group vs. the control group were determined independently. RNA isolation from blood samples and fluorescence-based quantitative PCR were carried out for the mRNA level of <i>M-csf</i> 20 days after fungal challenge.<h4>Results</h4>Our model resulted in typical symptoms of dermatophytosis on rabbit skin after challenged with fungus. Pathogens isolated from the infected rabbit skin were confirmed to be <i>T. mentagrophytes</i> by microscopic examination and PCR. The number of lymphocytes in the blood of the FI group was significantly decreased in comparison to the control group 2 days after the fungal challenge, but was significantly increased in comparison the control group 10 days after the fungal challenge (<i>P</i> < 0.01).

Antimicrobial prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy have improved survival of these patients; however, the failure rates of prophylaxis are not negligible. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the reasons behind failure of antimicrobial prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy.<h4>Setting</h4>This systematic review included prospective randomised controlled trials and prospective single-arm studies.<h4>Participants</h4>The studies included were on prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy of opportunistic infections in transplant recipients. Studies were included from databases MEDLINE, CENTRAL and Embase published until October first 2018.<h4>Primary and secondary outcome measures</h4>Primary outcome measures were breakthrough infections, adverse events leading to stopping of treatment, switching medication or dose reduction. Secondary outcome measures were acquired resistance to antimicrobials, antifungals or antivirals and death.<h4>Results</h4>From 3317 identified records, 30 records from 24 studies with 2851 patients were included in the systematic review. Seventeen focused on prophylactic and pre-emptive treatment of cytomegalovirus and seven studies on invasive fungal infection. The main reasons for failure of prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy were adverse events and breakthrough infections, which were described in 54% (13 studies) and 38% (9 studies) of the included studies, respectively. In 25%, six of the studies, a detailed description of patients who experienced failure of prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy was unclear or lacking.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results show that although failure is reported in the studies, the level of detail prohibits a detailed analysis of failure of prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy. Clearly reporting on patients with a negative outcome should be improved. We have provided guidance on how to detect failure early in a clinical setting in accordance to the results from this systematic review.<h4>Prospero registration number</h4>CRD42017077606.","<h4>Objectives</h4>Infections remain a threat for solid organ and stem cell transplant recipients.

However, severe pulmonary or disseminated cases require repeated intra-venous doses of amphotericin B or even surgical debridement of the infected tissue. The unavoidable adverse side-effects of the current treatments, besides the growing drug resistance among Sporothrix genus, demands exploration of alternative therapeutic options. Medicinal herbs, due to their multi-targeting capacity, are gaining popularity amidst the rising antimicrobial recalcitrance. Withania somnifera is a well-known medicinal herb with reported antifungal activities against several pathogenic fungal genera. In this study, the antifungal effect of the whole plant extract of W. somnifera (WSWE) has been explored for the first time, against an itraconazole resistant strain of S. globosa. WSWE treatment inhibited S. globosa yeast form growth in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 of 1.40 mg/ml. Minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) was found to be 50 mg/ml. Sorbitol protection and ergosterol binding assays, revealed that anti-sporotrichotic effects of WSWE correlated well with the destabilization of the fungal cell wall and cell membrane. This observation was validated through dose-dependent decrease in overall ergosterol contents in WSWE-treated S. globosa cells. Compositional analysis of WSWE through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) exhibited the presence of several anti-microbial phytochemicals like withanone, withaferin A, withanolides A and B, and withanoside IV and V. Withanone and withaferin A, purified from WSWE, were 10-20 folds more potent against S. globosa than WSWE, thus, suggesting to be the major phytocompounds responsible for the observed anti-sporotrichotic activity. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated the anti-sporotrichotic property of the whole plant extract of W. somnifera against S. globosa that could be further explored for the development of a natural antifungal agent against chronic Sporotrichosis.","Chronic topical cases of Sporotrichosis, a chronic fungal infection caused by the ubiquitously present cryptic members of the Sporothrix species complex, are treated with oral administrations of itraconazole.

In the present study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) using the 10x Genomics platform to analyze the changes in murine adrenal transcriptome following systemic <i>C.albicans</i> infection. A total of 16 021 cells were categorized into 18 transcriptionally distinct clusters, representing adrenocortical cells, endothelial cells, various immune cells, mesenchymal cells, smooth muscle cells, adrenal capsule, chromaffin cells, neurons and glials. As the main cell component in the adrenal gland responsible for steroidogenesis, the adrenocortical cells dramatically diminished and were further grouped into 10 subclusters, which differently distributed in the infected and uninfected samples. Pseudo-time analysis revealed transitions of the adrenocortical cells from the initial normal states to active or dysfunctional states following systemic <i>C.albicans</i> infection <i>via</i> two trajectory paths. Endothelial cells in the highly vascularized organ of adrenal gland further proliferated following infection, with the upregulation of genes positively regulating angiogenesis and downregulation of protective genes of endothelial cells.

It is a chronic relapsing and complex multifactorial disease that often necessitates long-term therapy. Despite various novel therapies, psoriasis remains a treatable but non-curable disease. Because the antitussive medication dextromethorphan (DXM) can inhibit murine bone marrow and human monocytes and slow the progression of arthritis in mice with type II collagen-induced arthritis, we explored whether the oral administration of DXM to mice with imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis can effectively alleviate psoriasis symptoms and improve immune regulation. Herein, we examined the therapeutic effects of DXM on psoriasis and its potential mechanisms of action in an IMQ-induced psoriasis mice model. We found that an oral dose of DXM (10 mg/kg) could more significantly reduce psoriasis symptoms compared with intraperitoneal injection. Seven days after the oral administration of DXM, the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score was significantly decreased compared with that in the vehicle group. Furthermore, DXM treatment also significantly ameliorated the psoriasis symptoms and the histopathological features of psoriasis, including stratum corneum thickening, desquamation, and immune cell infiltration. Additionally, DXM reduced the mRNA levels of the cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, IL-17A, and IL-22 in skin and the percentage of IL-17A and IL-22 producing T cell receptor γδ T cells (TCRγδT). Taken together, our research demonstrated that DXM could inhibit keratinocyte proliferation and alleviate psoriasis symptoms, which suggests the potential application of DXM in the treatment of chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases.","Psoriasis is an immune-mediated skin disease with a worldwide prevalence of 2-4% that causes scaling erythematous skin lesions.

Representative of this group, ns-LTP2.8, may be involved in the reaction to abiotic stress of germinating barley plants by mediating the intracellular transport of hydrophobic particles, such as lipids, helping to maintain homeostasis. The ns-LTP2.8 protein was selected for analysis due to its ability to transport not only linear hydrophobic molecules but also compounds with a more complex spatial structure. Moreover, ns-LTP2.8 has been qualified as a member of pathogenesis-related proteins, which makes it particularly important in relation to its high allergenic potential. This paper demonstrates for the first time the influence of various abiotic stresses acting separately as well as in their combinations on the change in the ns-LTP2.8 transcript, ns-LTP2.8 protein and total soluble protein content in the embryonal axes of germinating spring barley genotypes with different ns-LTP2.8 allelic forms and stress tolerance. Tissue localization of ns-LTP2.8 transcript as well as ns-LTP2.8 protein were also examined. Although the impact of abiotic stresses on the regulation of gene transcription and translation processes remains not fully recognized, in this work we managed to demonstrate different impact on applied stresses on the fundamental cellular processes in very little studied tissue of the embryonal axis of barley.","Abiotic stresses occur more often in combination than alone under regular field conditions limiting in more severe way crop production.

Assessment of stress, anxiety, masticatory performance and speech were determined using diurnal salivary cortisol level, Appearance Anxiety Inventory, multiple sieve technique and auditory perception analysis, respectively. Data were recorded at 6 different stages of rehabilitation (after maxillectomy, implant placement, and after prosthesis delivery (1 week, 1 month, 6 months and 1 year)). Demographic data were expressed as frequency distribution, while mean values were used to find differences between various rehabilitation stages using Friedman and chi-square test with statistical significance value at p < 0.05.<h4>Results</h4>Average daily salivary cortisol levels declined from post maxillectomy (22.80 ± 0.902) to 1 year after prosthesis wearing (8.65 ± 0.985), indicating stress reduction after ZI rehabilitation. Mean scores for appearance anxiety reduced from pre-prosthetic rehabilitation (27.350 ± 3.030) to 1 year (8.950 ± 0.887) following prosthesis wearing. Functional parameters for mastication and speech also improved significantly during the course of rehabilitation. All differences between pre-prosthetic to 1-year stage after prosthesis wearing were found to be statistically significant at p < 0.05.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Post ROCM maxillectomy cases after prosthetic rehabilitation using zygomatic implants showed significant improvement in the psychological (stress and anxiety) as well as function (mastication and speech) characteristics. Rehabilitation post ROCM maxillectomy with the present approach of fixed prosthesis using zygomatic implants mitigates deficient mastication and speech. It also impacts positively on patient psychology by decreasing stress and anxiety.","<h4>Purpose</h4>To determine the influence of prosthodontic rehabilitation using zygomatic implants in partial maxillectomy upon post-operative stress, anxiety and functional impairment, due to covid 19 associated rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM).<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Twenty maxillectomy patients fulfilling study criterion, received zygomatic implants (ZI) (quad zygoma) (ZDI Simpladent, Switzerland) retained/supported complete maxillary denture.

The host immune responses that define disease outcome during infection are largely unknown, although T helper responses are required. Adaptive immunity is influenced by innate immunity as antigen-presenting cells activate and educate adaptive responses. Macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) recognition of pathogen surface molecules are critical for <i>Coccidioides</i> clearance. We characterize the broad innate immune responses to <i>Coccidioides</i> by analyzing macrophage and dendritic cell responses to <i>Coccidioides</i> arthroconidia using avirulent, vaccine <i>Coccidioides</i> strain NR-166 (<i>Δcts2/Δard1/Δcts3</i>), developed from parental virulent strain C735.

Using bioactive compounds in plants to reduce the amounts of fungicides has become a clean and sustainable strategy of controlling <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i>. Our study found that selenium in soil mediated the phenylacetic acid-related metabolic pathway in oilseed rape and reduced the incidence rate of <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i>. The growth-inhibition rates of <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> were observed at 25.82%, 19.67%, and 52.61% for treatments of 0.8 mg·L<sup>-1</sup> dimethachlon, 0.1 mg·mL<sup>-1</sup> phenylacetic acid, and dimethachlon (0.8 mg·L<sup>-1</sup>) + phenylacetic acid (0.1 mg·mL<sup>-1</sup>), respectively. Phenylacetic acid reduced the application amount of dimethachlon and enhanced the inhibition effect for <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i>. Results also suggested that phenylacetic acid severely damaged the morphological structure, changed the electrical conductivity, and reduced the capacity of acid production and oxalic acid secretion of <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> mycelium. Further studies revealed that phenylacetic acid increased the gene-expression level of <i>Ssodc1</i>, <i>Ssodc2</i>, <i>CWDE2</i> and <i>CWDE10</i> in mycelium while decreasing the expression level of <i>SsGgt1</i>, and phenylacetic acid + dimethachlon reduced the relative expression level of <i>SsBil</i>.

The current research was aimed at assessing the activity of aloin A isolated from <i>Aloe barbadensis</i> Miller and its formulated ointment against six (6) selected clinical isolates.<h4>Methods</h4>The column chromatography was utilized in isolating aloin A from chloroform/methanol solvent polarity. The characterization of the isolated compound was performed by spectroscopy techniques corresponding to UV, IR, <sup>1</sup>H- and <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectroscopy. It was formulated as ointment using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and both the ointment and the isolated compound were probed for in vitro antimicrobial activity.<h4>Results</h4>Aloin A has been isolated from chloroform/methanol solvent mixture. The structure has been explicated as (10<i>S</i>)-10-β-d-glucopyranosyl-1,8-dihydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)-9(10<i>H</i>)-anthracenone(1<i>S</i>)-1,5-anhydro-1-[(9<i>S</i>)-4,5-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-10-oxo-9,10-dihydro-9-anthracenyl]-d-glucitol.

One particular approach is to develop control strategies for the non-feeding, soil-dwelling stages of WFT. Control of these stages could be enhanced through the use of granules impregnated with entomopathogenic fungi mixed in the soil.

To examine the efficacy of this approach, we evaluated the effects of a granular formulation of <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> on the soil-dwelling, pupal phases of <i>Frankliniella occidentalis</i> in laboratory bioassays and greenhouse experiments. Based on micromorphological observations of fungal conidia during the infection process after treatment of WFT with a <i>B. bassiana</i> suspension, fungal conidia complete the process of surface attachment, germination, and penetration of the body wall of the WFT pupa and enter the host within 60 h of treatment. Given these results, we undertook a controlled greenhouse experiment and applied <i>B. bassiana</i> granules to soil used to cultivate eggplants. Populations of <i>F. occidentalis</i> on eggplants grown in treated soil were 70% lower than those on plants grown in the untreated soil after 8 weeks.

10.1371/journal.pbio.3001182,Glyphosate inhibits melanization and increases susceptibility to infection in insects.,"Melanin, a black-brown pigment found throughout all kingdoms of life, has diverse biological functions including UV protection, thermoregulation, oxidant scavenging, arthropod immunity, and microbial virulence. Given melanin's broad roles in the biosphere, particularly in insect immune defenses, it is important to understand how exposure to ubiquitous environmental contaminants affects melanization. Glyphosate-the most widely used herbicide globally-inhibits melanin production, which could have wide-ranging implications in the health of many organisms, including insects. Here, we demonstrate that glyphosate has deleterious effects on insect health in 2 evolutionary distant species, Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and Anopheles gambiae (Diptera: Culicidae), suggesting a broad effect in insects. Glyphosate reduced survival of G. mellonella caterpillars following infection with the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans and decreased the size of melanized nodules formed in hemolymph, which normally help eliminate infection. Glyphosate also increased the burden of the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum in A. gambiae mosquitoes, altered uninfected mosquito survival, and perturbed the microbial composition of adult mosquito midguts. Our results show that glyphosate's mechanism of melanin inhibition involves antioxidant synergy and disruption of the reaction oxidation-reduction balance. Overall, these findings suggest that glyphosate's environmental accumulation could render insects more susceptible to microbial pathogens due to melanin inhibition, immune impairment, and perturbations in microbiota composition, potentially contributing to declines in insect populations.","Melanin, a black-brown pigment found throughout all kingdoms of life, has diverse biological functions including UV protection, thermoregulation, oxidant scavenging, arthropod immunity, and microbial virulence.

The most pronounced elevational changes are in climate conditions with characteristic decrease in air temperature with an increase in elevation. Studying intraspecific elevational variations in plant morphological traits and biomass allocation gives opportunity to understand how plants adapted to steep environmental gradients that change with elevation and how they may respond to climate changes related to global warming. In this study, phenotypic variation of an alpine plant <i>Soldanella carpatica</i> Vierh. (Primulaceae) was investigated on 40 sites distributed continuously across a 1,480-m elevation gradient in the Tatra Mountains, Central Europe. Mixed-effects models, by which plant traits were fitted to elevation, revealed that on most part of the gradient total leaf mass, leaf size and scape height decreased gradually with an increase in elevation, whereas dry mass investment in roots and flowers as well as individual flower mass did not vary with elevation. Unexpectedly, in the uppermost part of the elevation gradient overall plant size, including both below-and aboveground plant parts, decreased rapidly causing abrupt plant miniaturization. Despite the plant miniaturization at the highest elevations, biomass partitioning traits changed gradually across the entire species elevation range, namely, the leaf mass fraction decreased continuously, whereas the flower mass fraction and the root:shoot ratio increased steadily from the lowest to the highest elevations. Observed variations in <i>S. carpatica</i> phenotypes are seen as structural adjustments to environmental changes across elevations that increase chances of plant survival and reproduction at different elevations. Moreover, results of the present study agreed with the observations that populations of species from the 'Soldanella' intrageneric group adapted to alpine and subnival zones still maintain typical 'Soldanella'-like appearance, despite considerable reduction in overall plant size.","Plants growing along wide elevation gradients in mountains experience considerable variations in environmental factors that vary across elevations.

Although dermatophyte pathogens are normally susceptible to antifungal agents, onychomycosis often results in refractory chronic disease, and the formation of biofilms frequently underlines the inadequate responses and resistance to standard antifungal treatment. Numerous <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) studies have shown biofilm eradication or substantial reduction, however, such investigation has not yet been expanded to the biofilms of dermatophytes involved in onychomycosis. To shed a light on the potential application of aPDT in the clinic management of onychomycosis, in particular with the manifestation of dermatophytoma, we investigated photodynamic effects on the viabilities and the drug susceptibilities of the biofilm of dermatophytes <i>in vitro</i>. Here, methylene blue at the concentration of 8, 16, and 32 μg/ml applied as photosensitizing agent and LED (635 ± 10 nm, 60 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) as light source were employed against six strains of <i>Trichophyton rubrum</i>, ten strains of <i>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</i> and three strains of <i>Microsporum gypseum</i> isolated from clinical specimens. Our results indicated highly efficient photodynamic inhibition, exhibiting CFU (colony forming unit) reduction up to 4.6 log<sub>10</sub>, 4.3 log<sub>10</sub>, and 4.7 log<sub>10</sub> against the biofilms formed by <i>T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes</i>, and <i>M. gypseum</i>, respectively. Subjected biofilms displayed considerable decreases in SMICs (sessile minimum inhibitory concentrations) to multiple antifungal agents when compared with untreated groups, indicating the biofilms of dermatophytes became more susceptible to conventional antifungal drugs after aPDT. Additionally, the obliteration of biofilm after aPDT could be observed as shattered and ruptured structures being evident in SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) images. These findings suggest that aPDT is an attractive alternative treatment holding great promise for combating recalcitrant onychomycosis associated with the biofilm formation.","Dermatophytes are the most common cause of onychomycosis, counting for 90% fungal nail infection.

The interaction between A. baumannii infection and immune response can influence the prognosis of A. baumannii related pneumonia. The target of the present study was to investigate the role of immunodeficiency in A. baumannii induced pneumonia.<h4>Methods</h4>Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into the normal immunity control (NIC) group, normal immunity infection (NIA) group, immune compromised control (CIC) group, and immune compromised infection (CIA) group (n = 15 for each group). Intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide and intranasal instillation of A. baumannii solution were used to induce compromised immunity and murine pneumonia, respectively. The mice were sacrificed at 6 and 24 h later and the specimens were collected for further tests. Seven-day mortality of mice was also assessed.<h4>Results</h4>After A. baumannii stimulation, the recruitment of neutrophils in mice with normal immunity increased sharply (P = 0.030 at 6 h), while there was no significant raise of neutrophil counts in mice with compromised immune condition (P = 0.092 at 6 h, P = 0.772 at 24 h). The Th cell polarization presented with pulmonary interleukin (IL)-4 and interferon (IFN)-γ level in response to the A. baumannii in CIA group were significantly depressed in comparison with in NIA group (IFN-γ: P = 0.003 at 6 h; P = 0.001 at 24 h; IL-4: P < 0.001 at 6 h; P < 0.001 at 24 h). The pulmonary conventional dendritic cell accumulation was even found to be inhibited after A. baumannii infection in immunocompromised mice (P = 0.033). Correspondingly, A. baumannii associated pneumonia in mice with compromised immunity caused more early stage death, more severe histopathological impairment in lung.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A. baumannii could frustrate the immune response in immunocompromised conditions, and this reduced immune response is related to more severe lung injury and worse outcome in A. baumannii induced pneumonia.","<h4>Background</h4>Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) has become one of the most important opportunistic pathogens inducing nosocomial pneumonia and increasing mortality in critically ill patients recently.

Different factors can affect spermatophore quality. We manipulated males' diet and health to determine the balance of macronutrients deposited in the spermatophores of <i>Tenebrio molitor</i> beetles. For diet, we varied the concentration of proteins and carbohydrates, while for health status we used a fungal infection. Males with different condition copulated with unmanipulated females, and spermatophores were extracted to measure the amount of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. Diet and infection had an effect on the quality of the spermatophore. Diets with high protein and low carbohydrate contents produced spermatophores with higher protein, carbohydrate, and lipid contents. In contrast, diets with little protein and high in carbohydrates led to low quality spermatophores. Infected males produced spermatophores with the highest amount of all three macronutrients. In general, spermatophore content was carbohydrates>proteins>=lipids. The fact that sick males produced richer spermatophores can be explained as a terminal investment strategy. The large investment of carbohydrates may be related to the preparation of spermatozoa in males, and eggs in females.","Males of many insects deliver ejaculates with nutritious substances to females in the form of a spermatophore. Different factors can affect spermatophore quality. We manipulated males' diet and health to determine the balance of macronutrients deposited in the spermatophores of <i>Tenebrio molitor</i> beetles. For diet, we varied the concentration of proteins and carbohydrates, while for health status we used a fungal infection. Males with different condition copulated with unmanipulated females, and spermatophores were extracted to measure the amount of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates.

10.3892/etm.2021.11007,Role and mechanism of the Dectin-1-mediated Syk/NF-κB signaling pathway in <i>Talaromyces marneffei</i> infection.,"Dendritic cell-associated C-type lectin-1 (Dectin-1), a C-type lectin receptor, serves a critical role in host antifungal immunity. However, the molecular mechanism and function of Dectin-1-mediated signaling in response to infection by the pathogenic fungus <i>Talaromyces marneffei</i> remains unclear. To understand the role of Dectin-1 signaling against <i>T. marneffei</i> infection, the phosphorylation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, α (IκBα) and NF-κB were analyzed using western blotting, and the secretion of cytokines was detected using ELISA. Upon sporular or hyphal heat-killed <i>T. marneffei</i> stimulation, Dectin-1 in THP-1 macrophages recognized and induced the activation of Syk, and in turn triggered phosphorylation of downstream molecules IκBα and NF-κB, thus increasing the secretion of TNF-α and IL-8. Conversely, knockdown of Dectin-1 in THP-1 macrophages downregulated the phosphorylation of Syk, IκBα and NF-κB molecules, and significantly decreased the production of TNF-α and IL-8. These results indicated that Dectin-1 may have a crucial role in inducing the inflammatory response via increasing levels of TNF-α and IL-8 induced by <i>T. marneffei</i>, whereas NF-κB may be the key downstream molecule involved in the response to <i>T. marneffei</i> infection. Subsequently, THP-1 macrophages could orchestrate the innate immune system by releasing the cytokines TNF-α and IL-8. Therefore, it was hypothesized that regulation of the Dectin-1 signaling pathway may effectively interfere with the defense ability of the host against <i>T. marneffei</i> infection.","Dendritic cell-associated C-type lectin-1 (Dectin-1), a C-type lectin receptor, serves a critical role in host antifungal immunity.

Diagnostic confirmation is often delayed, with fatal prognosis in cases in which treatment is not rapidly established. <i>Case report:</i> We present two clinical cases of rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis with an atypical presentation form, consisting of a unilateral complete sudden vision loss. Intravenous treatment with liposomal amphotericin B was started and total orbital exenteration surgery was performed. The removed surgical area was filled with gauze impregnated with liposomal amphotericin B and was left open for cures every 12 hours. Due to the good clinical evolution, a reconstruction of the orbital exenteration defect was performed in Case 1 with a temporal muscle flap and a skin island pedicled flap. In Case 2, reconstruction was not performed due to the poor evolution of the patient. <i>Discussion:</i> As it is a very aggressive surgery, the aesthetic and functional sequelae are very important. When the survival of the patient is achieved, we should offer reconstructive solutions that improve their quality of life. The reconstruction carried out using a flap of the temporal muscle can be made in a single act without requiring microvascular surgery.","<i>Purpose:</i> Mucormycosis is an infection caused by fungi to the class Zygomycetes that usually appears in immunosuppressed patients.

Herein, ITZ was incorporated into a solution composed of ethanol, benzyl alcohol, hydrochloric acid, Transcutol P, and cyclomethicone as a delivery vehicle, solubilizer, protonating agent, permeation enhancer, and spreading agent, respectively. At 72 h, the optimal topical ITZ formulation (ITZ-TF#11) exhibited 135% enhanced skin permeability, which led to increases in drug deposition in the stratum corneum, epidermis, and dermis of 479%, 739%, and 2024%, respectively, compared with the deposition of 1% ITZ in ethanol (control). Moreover, on day 7, ITZ-TF#11 demonstrated 2.09- and 2.30-fold enhanced nail flux and drug deposition, compared with the control. At a dose of 40 mg/kg/day, ITZ-TF#11 showed 323% greater lesion recovery, a 165% lower mean erythema severity score, and a 37% lower mean logarithm of viable fungal cells in skin in the treated area, compared with mice that received oral ITZ at the same dose. Overall, the findings imply that ITZ-TF#11 is a superior alternative to oral ITZ for treatment of superficial mycosis.","In this study, a stable and highly skin-permeable topical delivery system for itraconazole (ITZ) was designed to provide effective treatment against superficial mycosis.

UV-C radiation can also be used as a pest management tool. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the effect of UV-C radiation on the physiology and gene expression level of <i>Plutella xylostella</i>, a destructive vegetable pest. Results showed that, after exposure to UV-C radiation for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, the activity of SOD (superoxide dismutase) and CAT (catalase) of <i>P. xylostella</i> increased, while the activity of PPO (polyphenol oxidase), POD (peroxidase), AChE (acetylcholinesterase), CarE (carboxylesterase), and ACP (acid phosphatase) decreased with increased exposure time. Correlation coefficient analyses indicated that the activity of CAT correlated positively, while PPO and CarE correlated negatively, with exposure time. Gene regulation analysis via qRT-PCR confirmed a significant increase in regulation in <i>CAT</i>, <i>CarE</i>, and <i>PPO</i>-related genes. We also investigated the effect of UV-C exposure on the virulence of <i>Cordyceps fumosorosea</i> against <i>P. xylostella</i>. Here, results indicated that when the fungal treatment was applied to larvae before UV-C radiation, the virulence of <i>C. fumosorosea</i> was significantly reduced. However, this decline in virulence of <i>C. fumosorosea</i> due to UV-C exposure remained only for one generation, and no effect was observed on secondary infection. On the other hand, when larvae were exposed to UV-C radiation before fungal application, the mortality rate significantly increased as the exposure time to UV-C radiation increased. From the current study, it could be concluded that UV-C exposure suppressed the immunity to <i>P. xylostella,</i> which later enhanced the virulence of entomopathogenic fungi. Moreover, the study also suggested that UV irradiation is an effective pest management tool that could be incorporated into pest management strategies, which could help reduce pesticide application, be economically beneficial for the farmer, and be environmentally safe.","Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) radiation significantly impacts living organisms.

Here an alternative view is proposed in which they occupy a spearheading role. In this view, drugs are technologies with an inherent therapeutic potential. Once created, they can spread from disease to disease independently of the drug creator's original intentions. Through the analysis of extensive literature and clinical trial records, it can be observed that successful drugs follow a life cycle in which they are studied at an increasing rate, and for the treatment of an increasing number of diseases, leading to clinical advancement. Such initial growth, following a power law on average, has a degree of momentum, but eventually decelerates, leading to stagnation and decay. A network model can describe the propagation of drugs from disease to disease in which diseases communicate with each other by receiving and sending drugs. Within this model, some diseases appear more prone to influence other diseases than be influenced, and vice versa. Diseases can also be organized into a drug-centric disease taxonomy based on the drugs that each adopts. This taxonomy reflects not only biological similarities across diseases, but also the level of differentiation of existing therapies. In sum, this study shows that drugs can become contagious technologies playing a driving role in the fight against disease. By better understanding such dynamics, pharmaceutical developers may be able to manage drug projects more effectively.","Drugs are often seen as ancillary to the purpose of fighting diseases.

Chemical insecticides used as fumigants to control overwintering M. alternatus in forests are highly toxic to the environment, so we investigated entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana ERL836 as an eco-friendly and alternative material to control overwintering M. alternatus. In this work, we evaluated the insecticidal activity of B. bassiana ERL836 against M. alternatus adults, the possibility of fungal colonization on pine tree bark, and finally the control efficacy of fungal pre-treatment on pine tree logs against emerging M. alternatus adults in semi-field and field conditions. M. alternatus adults were killed on the pine tree logs pre-treated with the B. bassiana ERL836. White conidia were observed not only on the surface of the dead adults but also on the pine tree logs, suggesting that the adults were killed by the fungus on the pine. A formulated ERL836 powder treatment on larvae-infested pine logs showed high insecticidal activity against adults, similar to that with the fungal powder suspension treatment, but we demonstrated that using the fungal powder was simpler than using the suspension in field conditions. Even in the field condition, the fungal powder treatment showed high insecticidal activity against M. alternatus adults, which we attribute to its ability to maintain fungal activity for a long time in field conditions by covering the pine tree logs with a film during overwintering. We confirmed that the risk that fungus-infected M. alternatus adults would spread the fungus to other non-target forest insects was low. Thus, even a high-concentration treatment in a specific area is unlikely to transmit the fungus outside that area, so it can be safely used to control this pine wilt nematode vector in forest ecosystems.","Monochamus alternatus is a major forest pest that spreads pine wilt disease in pine trees as a vector of pine wilt nematodes.

All ICA-negative isolates were considered as NTM suspects and further subjected to 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer gene sequencing for confirmation and species identification. Patients with active disease were treated with drug regimen as per the identified NTM species. Follow up of patients was done to determine clinical, radiological and microbiological outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 5409 TB suspects, 42 (0.77%) were diagnosed with NTM disease. Patients with active disease consenting for treatment were treated and followed up. Thirty four patients had NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) and the remaining eight had extrapulmonary NTM (EP-NTM) disease.

Paracoccidioides (mainly P. brasiliensis and P. lutzii) is responsible for paracoccidioidomycosis, a disease that affects mainly the lungs. The glycoprotein gp43 is involved in fungi adhesion to epithelial cells, which makes this protein an interesting target of study. A specific stretch of 15 amino acids that spans the region 181-195 (named P10) of gp43 is an important epitope of gp43 that is being envisioned as a vaccine candidate. Here we show that synthetic P10 forms typical amyloid aggregates in solution in very short times, a property that could hamper vaccine development. Seeds obtained by fragmentation of P10 fibrils were able to induce the aggregation of P4, but not P23, two other peptides derived from gp43. In silico analysis revealed several regions within the P10 sequence that can form amyloid with steric zipper architecture. Besides, in-silico proteolysis studies with gp43 revealed that aggregation-prone, P10-like peptides could be generated by several proteases, which suggests that P10 could be formed under physiological conditions. Considering our data in the context of a potential vaccine development, we redesigned the sequence of P10, maintaining the antigenic region (HTLAIR), but drastically reducing its aggregation propensity.","Fungal infection is an important health problem in Latin America, and in Brazil in particular.

A specific stretch of 15 amino acids that spans the region 181-195 (named P10) of gp43 is an important epitope of gp43 that is being envisioned as a vaccine candidate. Here we show that synthetic P10 forms typical amyloid aggregates in solution in very short times, a property that could hamper vaccine development. Seeds obtained by fragmentation of P10 fibrils were able to induce the aggregation of P4, but not P23, two other peptides derived from gp43. In silico analysis revealed several regions within the P10 sequence that can form amyloid with steric zipper architecture. Besides, in-silico proteolysis studies with gp43 revealed that aggregation-prone, P10-like peptides could be generated by several proteases, which suggests that P10 could be formed under physiological conditions. Considering our data in the context of a potential vaccine development, we redesigned the sequence of P10, maintaining the antigenic region (HTLAIR), but drastically reducing its aggregation propensity.",EuropePMC
10.3390/antibiotics11020265,"Ethyl Acetate Fraction of <i>Punica granatum</i> and Its Galloyl-HHDP-Glucose Compound, Alone or in Combination with Fluconazole, Have Antifungal and Antivirulence Properties against <i>Candida</i> spp.","Candidiasis is the most common fungal infection among immunocompromised patients. Its treatment includes the use of antifungals, which poses limitations such as toxicity and fungal resistance. Plant-derived extracts, such as <i>Punica granatum</i>, have been reported to have antimicrobial activity, but their antifungal effects are still unknown. We aimed to evaluate the antifungal and antiviral potential of the ethyl acetate fraction of <i>P. granatum</i> (PgEA) and its isolated compound galloyl-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-glucose (G-HHDP-G) against <i>Candida</i> spp. In silico analyses predicted the biological activity of G-HHDP-G. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of PgEA and G-HHDP-G, and their effects on biofilm formation, preformed biofilms, and phospholipase production were determined. In silico analysis showed that G-HHDP-G has antifungal and hepatoprotective effects. An in vitro assay confirmed the antifungal effects of PgEA and G-HHDP-G, with MIC in the ranges of 31.25-250 μg/mL and 31.25 ≥ 500 μg/mL, respectively. G-HHDP-G and PgEA synergistically worked with fluconazole against planktonic cells. The substances showed antibiofilm action, alone or in combination with fluconazole, and interfered with phospholipase production. The antifungal and antibiofilm actions of PgEA and G-HHDP-G, alone or in combination with fluconazole, in addition to their effects on reducing <i>Candida</i> phospholipase production, identify them as promising candidates for therapeutics.","Candidiasis is the most common fungal infection among immunocompromised patients.

Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster females are more likely than males to die from infection with several strains of the fungal entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana. The sexual dimorphism is not exclusively due to barrier defenses and persists when flies are inoculated by injection as well as by surface exposure. Loss of function mutations of Toll pathway genes remove the dimorphism in survivorship. Surprisingly, loss of function mutation of relish, a gene in the Imd pathway, also removes the dimorphism, but the dimorphism persists in flies carrying other Imd pathway mutations.

This fungus utilizes various transcriptional and morphological programs for host adaptation, but how this heterogeneity affects immunogenicity remains uncertain. We show that UME6, a transcriptional regulator of filamentation, is essential for intestinal C. albicans-primed systemic Th17 immunity. UME6 deletion and constitutive overexpression strains are non-immunogenic during commensal colonization, whereas immunogenicity is restored by C. albicans undergoing oscillating UME6 expression linked with β-glucan and mannan production. In turn, intestinal reconstitution with these fungal cell wall components restores protective Th17 immunity to mice colonized with UME6-locked variants. These fungal cell wall ligands and commensal C. albicans stimulate Th17 immunity through multiple host pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4, Dectin-1, and Dectin-2, which work synergistically for colonization-induced protection. Thus, dynamic gene expression fluctuations by C. albicans during symbiotic colonization are essential for priming host immunity against disseminated infection.","Systemic immunity is stringently regulated by commensal intestinal microbes, including the pathobiont Candida albicans.

Sophorolipids are emerging as key biosurfactants of yeast origins, used in various industrial sectors to lower surface tension. Recently, sophorolipid complexes have been applied in biomedicals and agriculture to eradicate infectious problems related to human and plant fungal pathogens. This study aimed to characterize the functional properties and antifungal activities of sophorolipids produced by a newly characterized Starmerella riodocensis GT-SL1R sp. nov. strain.<h4>Results</h4>Starmerella riodocensis GT-SL1R sp. nov. strain was belonged to Starmerella clade with 93.12% sequence similarity using the ITS technique for strain identification. Sophorolipids production was examined, using co-carbon substrates glucose and palm oil, with a yield on the substrate between 30 and 46%. Using shake-flasks, the S. riodocensis GT-SL1R strain produced biosurfactants with an emulsification activity of 54.59% against kerosene compared to the S. bombicola BCC5426 strain with an activity of 60.22%. Maximum productivities of GT-SL1R and the major sophorolipid-producer S. bombicola were similar at 0.8 gl<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. S. riodocensis GT-SL1R produced mixed forms of lactonic and acidic sophorolipids, shown by TCL, FTIR, and HPLC. Importantly, the complex sophorolipid mixture displayed antifungal activity against an opportunistic yeast pathogen Candida albicans by effectively reducing hyphal and biofilm formation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Sophorolipids derived from S. riodocensis demonstrate potential industrial and biomedical applications as green surfactant and antifungal agent. Since numerous renewable bioresources and industrial wastes could be used by microbial cell factories in the biosynthesis of biosurfactants to reduce the production cost, sophorolipids hold a promising alternative to current antimicrobials in treatments against infectious diseases in humans, animals, and plants.","<h4>Background</h4>Microbial derived-surfactants display low eco-toxicity, diverse functionality, high biodegradability, high specificity, and stability under extreme conditions.

This study aimed to characterize the functional properties and antifungal activities of sophorolipids produced by a newly characterized Starmerella riodocensis GT-SL1R sp. nov. strain.<h4>Results</h4>Starmerella riodocensis GT-SL1R sp. nov. strain was belonged to Starmerella clade with 93.12% sequence similarity using the ITS technique for strain identification. Sophorolipids production was examined, using co-carbon substrates glucose and palm oil, with a yield on the substrate between 30 and 46%. Using shake-flasks, the S. riodocensis GT-SL1R strain produced biosurfactants with an emulsification activity of 54.59% against kerosene compared to the S. bombicola BCC5426 strain with an activity of 60.22%. Maximum productivities of GT-SL1R and the major sophorolipid-producer S. bombicola were similar at 0.8 gl<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. S. riodocensis GT-SL1R produced mixed forms of lactonic and acidic sophorolipids, shown by TCL, FTIR, and HPLC. Importantly, the complex sophorolipid mixture displayed antifungal activity against an opportunistic yeast pathogen Candida albicans by effectively reducing hyphal and biofilm formation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Sophorolipids derived from S. riodocensis demonstrate potential industrial and biomedical applications as green surfactant and antifungal agent. Since numerous renewable bioresources and industrial wastes could be used by microbial cell factories in the biosynthesis of biosurfactants to reduce the production cost, sophorolipids hold a promising alternative to current antimicrobials in treatments against infectious diseases in humans, animals, and plants.",EuropePMC
10.1538/expanim.21-0191,The C-type lectin receptor Clec1A plays an important role in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by enhancing antigen presenting ability of dendritic cells and inducing inflammatory cytokine IL-17.,"Clec1A, a member of C-type lectin receptor family, has a carbohydrate recognition domain in its extracellular region, but no known signaling motif in the cytoplasmic domain. Clec1a is highly expressed in endothelial cells and weakly in dendritic cells. Although this molecule was reported to play an important role in the host defense against Aspergillus fumigatus by recognizing 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin on the fungal surface, the roles of this molecule in un-infected animals remain to be elucidated. In this study, we found that Clec1a<sup>-/-</sup> mice develop milder symptoms upon induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis. The maximum disease score was significantly lower, and demyelination and inflammation of the spinal cord were much milder in Clec1a<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to wild-type mice. No abnormality was detected in the immune cell composition in the draining lymph nodes and spleen on day 10 and 16 after EAE induction. Recall memory T cell proliferation after restimulation with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG<sub>35-55</sub>) in vitro was decreased in Clec1a<sup>-/-</sup> mice, and antigen presenting ability of Clec1a<sup>-/-</sup> dendritic cells was impaired. Interestingly, RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR analyses clearly showed that the expression of inflammatory cytokines including Il17a, Il6 and Il1b was greatly decreased in Clec1a<sup>-/-</sup> mice after induction of EAE, suggesting that this reduced cytokine production is responsible for the amelioration of EAE in Clec1a<sup>-/-</sup> mice. These observations suggest a novel function of Clec1A in the immune system.","Clec1A, a member of C-type lectin receptor family, has a carbohydrate recognition domain in its extracellular region, but no known signaling motif in the cytoplasmic domain.

The clinical signs and symptoms in humans are non-specific and case definitions vary. We reviewed and analysed the clinical manifestations of RVF in humans.<h4>Methods</h4>In this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched on different dates, the Embase (from 1947 to 13th October 2019), Medline (1946 to 14th October 2019), Global Health (1910 to 15th October 2019), and Web of Science (1970 to 15th October 2019) databases. Studies published in English, reporting frequency of symptoms in humans, and laboratory confirmed RVF were included. Animal studies, studies among asymptomatic volunteers, and single case reports for which a proportion could not be estimated, were excluded. Quality assessment was done using a modified Hoy and Brooks et al tool, data was extracted, and pooled frequency estimates calculated using random effects meta-analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 3765 articles retrieved, less than 1% (32 articles) were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Nine RVF clinical syndromes were reported including the general febrile, renal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, haemorrhagic, visual, neurological, cardio-pulmonary, and obstetric syndromes. The most common clinical manifestations included fever (81%; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 69-91; [26 studies, 1286 patients]), renal failure (41%; 23-59; [4, 327]), nausea (38%; 12-67; [6, 325]), jaundice (26%; 16-36; [15, 393]), haemorrhagic disease (26%; 17-36; [16, 277]), partial blindness (24%; 7-45; [11, 225]), encephalitis (21%; 11-33; [4, 327]), cough (4%; 0-17; [4, 11]), and miscarriage (54%) respectively. Death occurred in 21% (95% CI 14-29; [16 studies, 328 patients]) of cases, most of whom were hospitalised.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study delineates the complex symptomatology of human RVF disease into syndromes. This approach is likely to improve case definitions and detection rates, impact outbreak control, increase public awareness about RVF, and subsequently inform 'one-health' policies. This study provides a pooled estimate of the proportion of RVF clinical manifestations alongside a narrative description of clinical syndromes. However, most studies reviewed were case series with small sample sizes and enrolled mostly in-patients and out-patients, and captured symptoms either sparsely or using broad category terms.","<h4>Background</h4>Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an emerging, neglected, mosquito-borne viral zoonosis associated with significant morbidity, mortality and expanding geographical scope.

10.1038/s41598-017-03720-x,Proboscis infection route of Beauveria bassiana triggers early death of Anopheles mosquito.,"Entomopathogenic fungi are known to control vector mosquito populations. Thus, understanding the infection dynamics of entomopathogenic fungi is crucial for the effective control of insect pests such as mosquitoes. We investigated the dynamics of Beauveria bassiana s.l. 60-2 infection of Anopheles stephensi by exposing the mosquito to fungus-impregnated filter paper through two infection routes and then comparing the mortality and extent of infection. Fungal development was observed after using this inoculation method with both the tarsus route and the proboscis route, but early mosquito death occurred only after infection through the proboscis route. Fungal hyphae invaded almost all the tissues and organs before or after the death of the host, and fungal invasion of the brain was highly correlated with mortality. Moreover, although all mosquitoes that were alive at various time points after inoculation showed no fungal infection in the brain, fungal infection was detected in the brain in all dead mosquitoes. Our results suggest that fungal invasion of the brain represents one of the factors affecting mortality, and that the proboscis route of infection is critical for the early death of vector mosquitoes.","Entomopathogenic fungi are known to control vector mosquito populations.

Host spruce trees resist fungal invasion through structural and inducible defenses, but the underlying mechanisms at the molecular level, particularly with respect to the interaction between bark beetle-associated fungi and host trees, remain unclear. The aim of this study was to observe the pathological physiology and molecular changes in <i>Picea koraiensis</i> seedlings after artificial inoculation with <i>O. bicolor</i> strains (TS, BH, QH, MX, and LWQ). This study showed that <i>O. bicolor</i> was a weakly virulent pathogen of spruce, and that the virulent of the five <i>O. bicolor</i> strains showed differentiation. All <i>O. bicolor</i> strains could induce monoterpenoid release. A positive correlation between fungal virulence and release of monoterpenoids was observed. Furthermore, the release rate of monoterpenoids peaked at 4 days post-inoculation (dpi) and then decreased from 4 to 90 dpi. Transcriptomic analysis at 4 dpi showed that many plant-pathogen interaction processes and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) metabolic processes were activated. The expression of monoterpenoid precursor synthesis genes and diterpenoid synthesis genes was upregulated, indicating that gene expression regulated the release rate of monoterpenoids at 4 dpi.

This study was conducted to elucidate the correlation of the neuroprotective mechanism of resveratrol to protect cerebral ischemic damage with modulation of the levels of lipid peroxidation, anti-oxidants, transition elements, and toxic metals. Experimentally, 20 mg/kg of resveratrol was given once daily for 10 days. The cerebral ischemic operation was performed via occlusion of the right common carotid artery together with the right middle cerebral artery for 60 min followed by homogenization of the brain cortex and collection of supernatants for biochemical analysis. In the ligation group, levels of malondialdehyde, Fe, Cu, Al, and As increased but those of the anti-oxidants superoxide dismutase and catalase decreased. Pretreating rats with resveratrol before ischemia significantly reversed these effects. Our findings highlight the association of overload of Fe, Cu, As, and Al with the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia.

The cerebral ischemic operation was performed via occlusion of the right common carotid artery together with the right middle cerebral artery for 60 min followed by homogenization of the brain cortex and collection of supernatants for biochemical analysis. In the ligation group, levels of malondialdehyde, Fe, Cu, Al, and As increased but those of the anti-oxidants superoxide dismutase and catalase decreased. Pretreating rats with resveratrol before ischemia significantly reversed these effects. Our findings highlight the association of overload of Fe, Cu, As, and Al with the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia. In conclusion, resveratrol protects against cerebral ischemic injury via restraining lipid peroxidation, transition elements, and toxic metals, but increasing anti-oxidant activity.",EuropePMC
10.3390/polym14010135,"Formulation Development, Characterization and Antifungal Evaluation of Chitosan NPs for Topical Delivery of Voriconazole In Vitro and Ex Vivo.","This study aims to develop chitosan-based voriconazole nanoparticles (NPs) using spray-drying technique. The effect of surfactants and polymers on the physicochemical properties, in vitro release, and permeation of NPs was investigated. The prepared NPs containing various surfactants and polymers (e.g., Tween 20 (T20), Tween 80 (T80), sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), propylene glycol (PG), and Polyethylene glycol-4000 (PEG-4000)) were physiochemically evaluated for size, zeta potential, drug content, percent entrapment efficiency, in vitro release, and permeation across rats' skin. A Franz diffusion cell was used for evaluating the in vitro release and permeation profile. The voriconazole-loaded NPs were investigated for antifungal activity against <i>Candida albicans</i> (<i>C. albicans</i>). The prepared NPs were in the nano range (i.e., 160-500 nm) and positively charged. Images taken by a scanning electron microscope showed that all prepared NPs were spherical and smooth. The drug content of NPs ranged from 75% to 90%. Nanoparticle formulations exhibited a good in vitro release profile and transport voriconazole across the rat's skin in a slow control release manner. The NPs containing SLS, T80, and PG exhibited the best penetration and skin retention profile. In addition, the formulation exhibited a potential antifungal effect against <i>C. albicans</i>. It was concluded that the development of chitosan NPs has a great potential for the topical delivery of voriconazole against fungal infection.","This study aims to develop chitosan-based voriconazole nanoparticles (NPs) using spray-drying technique.

Nosemosis is a fungal infection of honey bees caused by either Nosema apis or N. ceranae. The putative greater virulence of N. ceranae has spurred interest in understanding how it differs from N. apis. Little is known of effects of N. apis or N. ceranae on honey bee learning and memory. Following a Pavlovian model that relies on the proboscis extension reflex, we compared acquisition learning and long-term memory recall of uninfected (control) honey bees versus those inoculated with N. apis, N. ceranae, or both. We also tested whether spore intensity was associated with variation in learning and memory. Neither learning nor memory differed among treatments. There was no evidence of a relationship between spore intensity and learning, and only limited evidence of a negative effect on memory; this occurred only in the co-inoculation treatment. Our results suggest that if Nosema spp. are contributing to unusually high colony losses in recent years, the mechanism by which they may affect honey bees is probably not related to effects on learning or memory, at least as assessed by the proboscis extension reflex.","Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) face an increasing number of challenges that in recent years have led to significant economic effects on apiculture, with attendant consequences for agriculture.

Diagnosis and management of COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) are challenging and our aim was to develop practical guidance.<h4>Methods</h4>A group of 28 international experts reviewed current insights in the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of CAPA and developed recommendations using GRADE methodology.<h4>Results</h4>The prevalence of CAPA varied between 0 and 33%, which may be partly due to variable case definitions, but likely represents true variation. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) remain the cornerstone of CAPA diagnosis, allowing for diagnosis of invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis and collection of the best validated specimen for Aspergillus diagnostics. Most patients diagnosed with CAPA lack traditional host factors, but pre-existing structural lung disease and immunomodulating therapy may predispose to CAPA risk. Computed tomography seems to be of limited value to rule CAPA in or out, and serum biomarkers are negative in 85% of patients. As the mortality of CAPA is around 50%, antifungal therapy is recommended for BAL positive patients, but the decision to treat depends on the patients' clinical condition and the institutional incidence of CAPA. We recommend against routinely stopping concomitant corticosteroid or IL-6 blocking therapy in CAPA patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>CAPA is a complex disease involving a continuum of respiratory colonization, tissue invasion and angioinvasive disease. Knowledge gaps including true epidemiology, optimal diagnostic work-up, management strategies and role of host-directed therapy require further study.","<h4>Purpose</h4>Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is increasingly reported in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

Macrophages and natural killer cells (NK cells) are two important types of innate immune cells that serve an important role in anti‑infection immunity. There has been limited research into the interactions between fungi and macrophages. In the present in vitro study, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR, ELISA and flow cytometry were performed to reveal that the interaction between macrophages and NK cells, regulated by Aspergillus fumigatus conidia, induced macrophages to polarize into M1 macrophages by secreting large quantities of tumor necrosis factor‑α, interleukin‑18 and Galectin‑9. In addition, when NK cells were co‑cultured with the conidia of A. fumigatus‑stimulated M1 macrophages, they exhibited increased activation levels and secretion of interferon‑γ (IFN‑γ). It was further demonstrated via antibody neutralization and gene silencing experiments that galectin‑9 served an important role in the interaction between macrophages and NK cells regulated by A. fumigatus. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that A. fumigatus induced the polarization of macrophages into M1 macrophages by secreting Galectin‑9, which then promoted NK cell activity and IFN‑γ secretion. The results provided improved understanding of the role of innate immune cells in invasive fungal infections. The present study also provided novel insight into the study of macrophages and NK cells in inflammatory infections caused by A. fumigatus and potential strategies to control the progression of inflammation.","The progression of disease caused by fungal infection is closely associated with the human immune system.

There are currently approximately 300,000 acute cases of aspergillosis, most of which result from a pulmonary infection of immunocompromised patients by the common soil organism and opportunistic pathogen <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> Patients are treated with antifungal drugs, such as amphotericin B (AmB). However, AmB has serious limitations due to human organ toxicity. AmB is slightly less toxic if loaded in liposomes, such as AmBisome or AmB-loaded liposomes (AmB-LLs). Even with antifungal therapy, recurrent infections are common, and 1-year fatality rates may exceed 50%. We have previously shown that coating AmB-LLs with the extracellular oligomannan-binding domain of the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-2 (DEC2-AmB-LLs) effectively targets DEC2-AmB-LLs to cell walls, exopolysaccharide matrices, and biofilms of fungal pathogens <i>in vitro</i><i>In vitro</i>, DEC2-AmB-LLs reduce the effective dose of AmB for 95% inhibition and killing of <i>A. fumigatus</i> 10-fold compared to that of untargeted AmB-LLs. Herein we tested the antifungal activity of DEC2-AmB-LLs relative to that of untargeted AmB-LLs in immunosuppressed mice with pulmonary aspergillosis. Remarkably, DEC2-AmB-LLs bound 30-fold more efficiently to <i>A. fumigatus</i> at sites of infection in the lungs. Furthermore, Dectin-2-targeted liposomes delivering AmB at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg of body weight significantly reduced the fungal burden in lungs compared to results with untargeted AmB-LLs at 0.2 mg/kg and micellar voriconazole at 20 mg/kg and prolonged mouse survival. By dramatically increasing the efficacy of antifungal drugs at low doses, targeted liposomes have the potential to create a new clinical paradigm to treat diverse fungal diseases.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Invasive aspergillosis (IA) generally results from a pulmonary infection of immunocompromised patients by the common soil organism and opportunistic pathogen <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> The susceptible population has expanded rapidly due to the increased number of cancer patients with immunocompromising chemotherapy and transplant patients taking immunosuppressants. Patients are treated with antifungals, such as liposomal amphotericin B, with per-patient costs exceeding $50,000 in the United States. However, AmB has serious side effects due to host toxicity, which limits its usage and contributes to the lack of fungal clearance in patients at safe doses. Fifty percent of IA patients die within a year. Herein, we employed liposomal amphotericin B coated with the innate immune receptor Dectin-2 to direct antifungals specifically to the fungal pathogen. Using two mouse models of pulmonary aspergillosis, we demonstrate that Dectin-2-targeted delivery of amphotericin B to <i>A. fumigatus</i> resulted in remarkably higher efficacy than that of the untargeted antifungal formulations.","Invasive fungal diseases cause millions of deaths each year.

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that emodin protects the intestinal function and is involved in the immune response in SAP.<h4>Methods</h4>The network pharmacology was established using the Swiss target prediction and pathway enrichment analysis. The SAP mice model was induced by cerulein (50 μg/kg) and lipopolysaccharide (10 mg/kg) hyperstimulation. The pharmacological effect of emodin in treating SAP was evaluated at mRNA and protein levels by various methods.<h4>Results</h4>The network analysis provided the connectivity between the targets of emodin and the intestinal barrier-associated proteins and predicted the BAX/Bcl-2/caspase 3 signaling pathway. Emodin alleviated the pathological damages to the pancreas and intestine and reduced the high concentrations of serum amylase and cytokines in vivo. Emodin increased the expression of intestinal barrier-related proteins and reversed the changes in the apoptosis-related proteins in the intestine. Simultaneously, emodin regulated the ratio of T helper type 1 (TH1), TH2, TH17, γδ T cells, and interferon γ/interleukin 17 producing γδ T cells.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings partly verified the mechanism underlying the regulation of the intestinal barrier and immune response by emodin.","<h4>Objective</h4>The intestinal barrier injury caused by severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) can induce enterogenous infection, further aggravating the inflammatory reactions and immune responses.

To date, more than thousands of chemical constituents have been identified from the cannabis plant, all of which possess different chemical properties that require different conditions for preservation during drying and extraction. However, scientific publications that explore these areas for the cannabis plant are currently lacking.<h4>Method</h4>This is a narrative review paper which focuses on critiquing drying and extraction methods of Cannabis sativa L. plant. Relevant keywords such as medicinal cannabis, extraction, solvent, cannabinoids, and terpenes have been searched in PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library (Wiley) databases.<h4>Result</h4>To find relevant papers for this narrative review, 93 papers have been reviewed. Among them, 12 irrelevant papers were discarded. The excluded papers were either about hemp seed oil or hemp fiber and protein. Based on this review, solvent extraction is the most common method for cannabis plants. Although solventless and hydrodynamic extraction are known for their high yield and feasibility, more investigation is needed in these areas. Regarding the drying process, hang-drying is the most convenient method; however, it may be substituted by freeze-drying in the near future.<h4>Discussion</h4>This review analyses various drying and extraction processes to guide the selection of suitable methods for various types of cannabis products and applications. This is done by outlining traditional and modern methods of drying techniques, exploring the importance of solvents for extraction, visiting solventless extraction procedures, and finally comparing conventional and alternative methods of extraction.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In conclusion, based on the current knowledge, using organic solvents is the most convenient method for medicinal cannabis extraction. However, more research is needed for some of the drying and extraction methods. Also, developing a green and sustainable cannabis extraction method should be considered for future studies.","<h4>Introduction</h4>As the cannabis industry transitions from a black market to a legal market, product development, and methods of extraction have become a focal point.

10.2147/ptt.s367744,Bimekizumab for the Treatment of Psoriasis: A Review of the Current Knowledge.,"Bimekizumab, a novel humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that neutralizes both IL-17A and IL-17F, was recently approved the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. Bimekizumab represents the latest anti IL-17 treatment available for the management of moderate to severe psoriasis. Bimekizumab safety and efficacy profiles were evaluated in four Phase III clinical trials, which evaluated bimekizumab versus placebo and ustekinumab (BE VIVID), versus placebo (BE READY), versus adalimumab (BE SURE), and versus secukinumab (BE RADIANT). Overall, bimekizumab displayed promising results in terms of both efficacy and safety, allowing reach PASI90 and PASI100 in short time (as early as week 4) and maintain it in the long term (52 weeks), with acceptable safety profile. Also, bimekizumab showed a rapid onset of response and a higher efficacy when compared to adalimumab, ustekinumab and secukinumab, with comparable safety profile. Herein, we carried out a comprehensive literature review of the available literature data about bimekizumab in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.","Bimekizumab, a novel humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that neutralizes both IL-17A and IL-17F, was recently approved the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.

Pepper exhibits the potential to prevent or attenuate carcinogenesis as therapeutic tools. However, the related mechanism remains unelucidated. <b>Aim of the Study:</b> The present study aims to provide reasonable information for the explanation of the dissimilarity of the essential oils from white (WPEO) and black pepper (BPEO). <b>Materials and Methods:</b> WPEO, BPEO, and their single active component, as well as synthetic antioxidants, were compared by the cell model methods and chemical methods, including intracellular antioxidant activity (CAA), total antioxidant activities (TAA), superoxide radical (SR), hydroxyl radical (HR), DPPH radical (DR) scavenging activities and inhibition ability of lipoprotein lipid peroxidation (ILLP). <b>Results:</b> The median effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) values (mg/mL) of the WPEO and BPEO of SR, HR, DR, and ILLP were 0.437 and 0.327, 0.486 and 0.204, 7.332 and 6.348, 0.688, and 0.624 mg/mL, respectively. The CAA units of WPEO and BPEO were 50.644 and 54.806, respectively. CAA, DR, and TAA of BPEO were significantly higher than those of WPEO (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The BPEO and WPEO can be differentiated as the former have higher correlations with 3-carene, α-pinene, β-pinene, and limonene while the latter has a higher caryophyllene correlation. The WPEO and BPEO show a good intracellular scavenging ability of reactive oxygen species in HeLa cells. <b>Conclusion:</b> Generally, pepper oil has stronger activities than single components, indicating that pepper is a broad-spectrum natural antioxidant.","<b>Ethnopharmacological Relevance:</b> Pepper essential oils have potential immunomodulatory, anti-tumor, and anti-cancer activities.

However, risk mitigation by monitoring for multiple mycotoxins remains a challenge using existing methods due to their complex matrices. A multi-toxin method for 22 mycotoxins (aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>; ochratoxin A, B, C; Fumonisin B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub>; 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, diace-toxyscirpenol, HT-2, T-2, deepoxy-deoxynivalenol, deoxynivalenol, neosolaniol, zearalenone, and sterigmatocystin) using centrifugation-assisted solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up prior to ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis for Arecae Semen and its processed products was developed and validated. Several experimental parameters affecting the extraction and clean-up efficiency were systematically optimized. The results indicated good linearity in the range of 0.1-1000 μg/kg (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> > 0.99), low limits of detection (ranging from 0.04 μg/kg to 1.5 μg/kg), acceptable precisions, and satisfactory recoveries for the selected mycotoxins. The validated method was then applied to investigate mycotoxin contamination levels in <i>Areca catechu</i> and its processed products. The mycotoxins frequently contaminating <i>Areca catechu</i> were aflatoxins (AFs), and the average contamination level and number of co-occurring mycotoxins in the Arecae Semen slices (Binlangpian) were higher than those in commercially whole Arecae Semen and Arecae Semen Tostum (Jiaobinlang). Sterigmatocystin was detected in 5 out of 30 Arecae Semen slices. None of the investigated mycotoxins were detected in Arecae pericarpium (Dafupi).

10.3390/jof7110984,Entomopathogenic Fungi Biodiversity in the Soil of Three Provinces Located in Southwest China and First Approach to Evaluate Their Biocontrol Potential.,"Entomopathogenic fungi (EF), who represent active agents to control insect natural populations, usually persist in terrestrial habitats. Southwest area in China has various climate conditions and abundant plant biodiversity (crop, forest, grassy, orchard and arable areas). Nevertheless, the potential of soil-inhabitant EF as insect pest biocontrol agents, is unknown. In this study, first the EF biodiversity from soil of three provinces (Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan) was surveyed. Then, the virulence of 29 isolated strains against <i>Bemesia tabaci</i> and <i>Spodoptera litura</i> was assessed. After analyzing 212 soil samples, 497 isolated fungi were identified. Out of them, 490 isolates were classified in 45 species of 24 genera, whereas the other seven isolates, belonging to <i>Paecilomyces</i> and <i>Purpureocillium</i> genera, were not identified under species level. Furthermore, the EF biodiversity from soil of Sichuan, Yunan, and Guizhou areas, analyzed by Shannon Wiener Index (SWI) was rated at 2.98, 1.89, and 2.14, while SWIs-biodiversity in crop, forest, grassy, orchard and arable areas was rated at 2.88, 2.74, 3.05, 2.39, and 2.47. SWI data suggested that soil from Sichuan area and grassy had higher EF biodiversity compared with other analyzed provinces and areas. Virulence bioassay results indicated that, out of the 29 isolates tested, 24 were pathogenic against <i>B. tabaci</i> and <i>S. litura</i>, resulting in mortality rates >10%. In conclusion, this study reports the EF distribution and biodiversity in soil from three provinces located at Southwest China, whereas their potential use as a tool for the <i>B. tabaci</i> and <i>S. litura</i> biocontrol must be further investigated.","Entomopathogenic fungi (EF), who represent active agents to control insect natural populations, usually persist in terrestrial habitats.

10.1038/s41598-019-45453-z,Field trial of a probiotic bacteria to protect bats from white-nose syndrome.,"Tools for reducing wildlife disease impacts are needed to conserve biodiversity. White-nose syndrome (WNS), caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, has caused widespread declines in North American bat populations and threatens several species with extinction. Few tools exist for managers to reduce WNS impacts. We tested the efficacy of a probiotic bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, to reduce impacts of WNS in two simultaneous experiments with caged and free-flying Myotis lucifugus bats at a mine in Wisconsin, USA. In the cage experiment there was no difference in survival between control and P. fluorescens-treated bats. However, body mass, not infection intensity, predicted mortality, suggesting that within-cage disturbance influenced the cage experiment. In the free-flying experiment, where bats were able to avoid conspecific disturbance, infection intensity predicted the date of emergence from the mine. In this experiment treatment with P. fluorescens increased apparent overwinter survival five-fold compared to the control group (from 8.4% to 46.2%) by delaying emergence of bats from the site by approximately 32 days. These results suggest that treatment of bats with P. fluorescens may substantially reduce WNS mortality, and, if used in combination with other interventions, could stop population declines.","Tools for reducing wildlife disease impacts are needed to conserve biodiversity.

10.1098/rsos.140470,Sex and hibernaculum temperature predict survivorship in white-nose syndrome affected little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus).,"White-nose syndrome (WNS), an emerging infectious disease caused by the novel fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, has devastated North American bat populations since its discovery in 2006. The little brown myotis, Myotis lucifugus, has been especially affected. The goal of this 2-year captive study was to determine the impact of hibernacula temperature and sex on WNS survivorship in little brown myotis that displayed visible fungal infection when collected from affected hibernacula. In study 1, we found that WNS-affected male bats had increased survival over females and that bats housed at a colder temperature survived longer than those housed at warmer temperatures. In study 2, we found that WNS-affected bats housed at a colder temperature fared worse than unaffected bats. Our results demonstrate that WNS mortality varies among individuals, and that colder hibernacula are more favourable for survival. They also suggest that female bats may be more negatively affected by WNS than male bats, which has important implications for the long-term survival of the little brown myotis in eastern North America.","White-nose syndrome (WNS), an emerging infectious disease caused by the novel fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, has devastated North American bat populations since its discovery in 2006.

We aimed to compare the effectiveness and comfort evaluation of HFNC with different initial flow settings in patients with AHRF.<h4>Methods</h4>Studies published by October 10, 2022, were searched exhaustively in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database. Network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed with STATA 17.0 and R software (version 4.2.1). A Bayesian framework was applied for this NMA. Comparisons of competing models based on the deviance information criterion (DIC) were used to select the best model for NMA. The primary outcome is the intubation at day 28. Secondary outcomes included short-term and long-term mortality, comfort score, length of ICU or hospital stay, and 24-h PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>.<h4>Results</h4>This NMA included 23 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 5774 patients. With NIV as the control, the HFNC_high group was significantly associated with lower intubation rates (odds ratio [OR] 0.72 95% credible interval [CrI] 0.56 to 0.93; moderate quality evidence) and short-term mortality (OR 0.81 95% CrI 0.69 to 0.96; moderate quality evidence). Using HFNC_Moderate (Mod) group (mean difference [MD] - 1.98 95% CrI -3.98 to 0.01; very low quality evidence) as a comparator, the HFNC_Low group had a slight advantage in comfort scores but no statistically significant difference. Of all possible interventions, the HFNC_High group had the highest probability of being the best in reducing intubation rates (73.04%), short-term (82.74%) and long-term mortality (67.08%). While surface under the cumulative ranking curve value (SUCRA) indicated that the HFNC_Low group had the highest probability of being the best in terms of comfort scores.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The high initial flow settings (50-60 L/min) performed better in decreasing the occurrence of intubation and mortality, albeit with poor comfort scores. Treatment of HFNC for AHRF patients ought to be initiated from moderate flow rates (30-40 L/min), and individualized flow settings can make HFNC more sensible in clinical practice.","<h4>Background</h4>High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has been proven effective in improving patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF), but a discussion of its use for initial flow settings still need to be provided.

10.1038/s41598-020-74870-8,Behaviours indicating cannibalistic necrophagy in ants are modulated by the perception of pathogen infection level.,"Cannibalistic necrophagy is rarely observed in social hymenopterans, although a lack of food could easily favour such behaviour. One of the main supposed reasons for the rarity of necrophagy is that eating of nestmate corpses carries the risk of rapid spread of pathogens or parasites. Here we present an experimental laboratory study on behaviour indicating consumption of nestmate corpses in the ant Formica polyctena. We examined whether starvation and the fungal infection level of the corpses affects the occurrence of cannibalistic necrophagy. Our results showed that the ants distinguished between corpses of different types and with different levels of infection risk, adjusting their behaviour accordingly. The frequency of behaviours indicating cannibalistic necrophagy increased during starvation, although these behaviours seem to be fairly common in F. polyctena even in the presence of other food sources. The occurrence and significance of cannibalistic necrophagy deserve further research because, in addition to providing additional food, it may be part of the hygienic behaviour repertoire. The ability to detect infections and handle pathogens are important behavioural adaptations for social insects, crucial for the fitness of both individual workers and the entire colony.","Cannibalistic necrophagy is rarely observed in social hymenopterans, although a lack of food could easily favour such behaviour.

The networks form a lubricious, hydrated protective shield along epithelial regions within the human body. The critical role played by mucin networks in impacting the transport properties of biofunctional molecules (e.g., biogenic molecules, probes, nanoparticles), and its effect on bioavailability are well described in the literature. An alternate perspective is provided in this paper, presenting mucin's complex network structure, and its interdependent functional characteristics in human physiology. We highlight the recent advances that were achieved through the use of mucin in diverse areas of bioengineering applications (e.g., drug delivery, biomedical devices and tissue engineering). Mucin network formation is a highly complex process, driven by wide variety of molecular interactions, and the network possess structural and chemical variations, posing a great challenge to understand mucin's bulk behavior. Through this review, the prospective potential of polymer based analogs to serve as mucin mimic is suggested.

10.1128/msystems.01116-20,Dissecting Disease-Suppressive Rhizosphere Microbiomes by Functional Amplicon Sequencing and 10× Metagenomics.,"Disease-suppressive soils protect plants against soilborne fungal pathogens that would otherwise cause root infections. Soil suppressiveness is, in most cases, mediated by the antagonistic activity of the microbial community associated with the plant roots. Considering the enormous taxonomic and functional diversity of the root-associated microbiome, identification of the microbial genera and mechanisms underlying this phenotype is challenging. One approach to unravel the underlying mechanisms is to identify metabolic pathways enriched in the disease-suppressive microbial community, in particular, pathways that harbor natural products with antifungal properties. An important class of these natural products includes peptides produced by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Here, we applied functional amplicon sequencing of NRPS-associated adenylation domains (A domains) to a collection of eight soils that are suppressive or nonsuppressive (i.e., conducive) to Fusarium culmorum, a fungal root pathogen of wheat. To identify functional elements in the root-associated bacterial community, we developed an open-source pipeline, referred to as dom2BGC, for amplicon annotation and putative gene cluster reconstruction through analyzing A domain co-occurrence across samples. We applied this pipeline to rhizosphere communities from four disease-suppressive and four conducive soils and found significant similarities in NRPS repertoires between suppressive soils. Specifically, several siderophore biosynthetic gene clusters were consistently associated with suppressive soils, hinting at competition for iron as a potential mechanism of suppression. Finally, to validate dom2BGC and to allow more unbiased functional metagenomics, we performed 10× metagenomic sequencing of one suppressive soil, leading to the identification of multiple gene clusters potentially associated with the disease-suppressive phenotype. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Soil-borne plant-pathogenic fungi continue to be a major threat to agriculture and horticulture. The genus Fusarium in particular is one of the most devastating groups of soilborne fungal pathogens for a wide range of crops. Our approach to develop novel sustainable strategies to control this fungal root pathogen is to explore and exploit an effective, yet poorly understood naturally occurring protection, i.e., disease-suppressive soils. After screening 28 agricultural soils, we recently identified four soils that were suppressive to root disease of wheat caused by Fusarium culmorum. We also confirmed, via sterilization and transplantation, that the microbiomes of these soils play a significant role in the suppressive phenotype. By adopting nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) functional amplicon screening of suppressive and conducive soils, we here show how computationally driven comparative analysis of combined functional amplicon and metagenomic data can unravel putative mechanisms underlying microbiome-associated plant phenotypes.","Disease-suppressive soils protect plants against soilborne fungal pathogens that would otherwise cause root infections.

However, in addition to fungal spores, humans are simultaneously exposed to other inflammatory agents such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), with uncertain relevance to disease expression. To determine how high dose inhalation of LPS influences the expression of allergic airway disease induced by the allergenic mold Aspergillus niger (A. niger).<h4>Methods</h4>C57BL/6J mice were intranasally challenged with the viable spores of A. niger with and without 1 μg of LPS over two weeks. Changes in airway hyperreactivity, airway and lung inflammatory cell recruitment, antigen-specific immunoglobulins, and histopathology were determined.<h4>Results</h4>In comparison to mice challenged only with A. niger, addition of LPS (1 μg) to A. niger abrogated airway hyperresponsiveness and strongly attenuated airway eosinophilia, PAS+ goblet cells and T<sub>H</sub>2 responses while enhancing T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>17 cell recruitment to lung. Addition of LPS resulted in more severe, diffuse lung inflammation with scattered, loosely-formed parenchymal granulomas, but failed to alter fungus-induced IgE and IgG antibodies.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In contrast to the strongly allergic lung phenotype induced by fungal spores alone, addition of a relatively high dose of LPS abrogates asthma-like features, replacing them with a phenotype more consistent with acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP).

By far the most common presentation of the disease is cryptococcal meningitis (CM), which leads to an estimated 15-20% of all HIV related deaths worldwide, 75% of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. However, to the best of our knowledge there is quite limited reviewed data on the epidemiology of cryptococcal antigenemia in a large HIV-infected population in resource limited settings.<h4>Methods</h4>Articles published in English irrespective of the time of publication were systematically searched using comprehensive search strings from PubMed/Medline and SCOPUS. In addition, Google Scholar and Google databases were searched manually for grey literature. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The pooled prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia was determined with 95% confidence interval (CI).<h4>Results</h4>Among 2941 potential citations, we have included 22 studies with a total of 8338 HIV positive individuals. The studies were reported in ten different countries during the year (2007-2018). Most of the articles reported the mean CD4 count of the participants below 100 cells/μl.

By far the most common presentation of the disease is cryptococcal meningitis (CM), which leads to an estimated 15-20% of all HIV related deaths worldwide, 75% of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. However, to the best of our knowledge there is quite limited reviewed data on the epidemiology of cryptococcal antigenemia in a large HIV-infected population in resource limited settings.<h4>Methods</h4>Articles published in English irrespective of the time of publication were systematically searched using comprehensive search strings from PubMed/Medline and SCOPUS. In addition, Google Scholar and Google databases were searched manually for grey literature. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The pooled prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia was determined with 95% confidence interval (CI).<h4>Results</h4>Among 2941 potential citations, we have included 22 studies with a total of 8338 HIV positive individuals. The studies were reported in ten different countries during the year (2007-2018). Most of the articles reported the mean CD4 count of the participants below 100 cells/μl. The pooled prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia at different CD4 count and ART status was at 8% (95%CI: 6-10%) (ranged between 1.7 and 33%).

The marked depletion in the beneficial <i>Lactobacillus</i> sp. increases the risk of infection with sexually transmitted pathogens, resulting in gynaecological issues. Vaginal infections that are becoming increasingly prevalent, especially among women of reproductive age, require an effective concentration of antimicrobial drugs at the infectious sites for complete disease eradication. Thus, topical treatment is recommended as it allows direct therapeutic action, reduced drug doses and side effects, and self-insertion. However, the alterations in the physiological conditions of the vagina affect the effectiveness of vaginal drug delivery considerably. Conventional vaginal dosage forms are often linked to low retention time in the vagina and discomfort which significantly reduces patient compliance. The lack of optimal prevention and treatment approaches have contributed to the unacceptably high rate of recurrence for vaginal diseases. To combat these limitations, several novel approaches including nano-systems, mucoadhesive polymeric systems, and stimuli-responsive systems have been developed in recent years. This review discusses and summarises the recent research progress of these novel approaches for vaginal drug delivery against various vaginal diseases. An overview of the concept and challenges of vaginal infections, anatomy and physiology of the vagina, and barriers to vaginal drug delivery are also addressed.","An optimal host-microbiota interaction in the human vagina governs the reproductive health status of a woman.

One question regards the efficacy of reconstruction of acetabular defects using a combination of tantalum metal augments (TMAs) and impaction graft in single-stage revision for periprosthetic infection.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In the period between July 2009 and August 2014, 24 patients with combined segmental and cavitary acetabular defects and Paprosky classification grade IIB, IIC, and IIIA had hips reconstructed using the combination of TMAs and antibiotic-loaded impaction grafting. A similar group of 30 patients who received single-stage revision without metal augments were identified and taken as control. All patients received a polyethylene cemented cup and long cementless (Wagner SL) stem. Patients were prospectively evaluated using the modified Harris Hip Score (HHS) in addition to radiological evaluation at 3, 6, and 12 months then annually thereafter.<h4>Results</h4>At an average follow-up period of 4 years (range 2-7 years), all but one patient in the study group were free of infection, indicating a 96% success rate. This rate of eradicating infection was comparable to the 97% success rate in the control group. All metal augments were stable, and good incorporation of the impacted bone graft was observed. The HHS improved significantly from 27 preoperatively to 83 postoperatively (P < 0.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Metal augments can convert massive acetabular defects to a more contained defect suitable for grafting. The combination of tantalum augments that provide strong structural support and antibiotic-loaded allograft is successful in the mid-term in single-stage revisions for infection.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>Level IV (prospective case series).","<h4>Background</h4>Reconstruction of combined segmental and cavitary defects of the acetabulum is a challenge to the hip surgeon.

Recently, CmsA and CmsB were identified as the α-(1→2)-mannosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of the α-core-mannan. However, the α-(1→6)-mannosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of the α-core-mannan has not been identified yet. In this study, we analyzed 9 putative α-(1→6)-mannosyltransferase gene disruption strains of A. fumigatus. The Δ<i>anpA</i> strain resulted in decreased mycelial elongation and reduced conidia formation. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed that the Δ<i>anpA</i> strain failed to produce the α-core-mannan of fungal-type galactomannan. We also found that recombinant AnpA exhibited much stronger α-(1→6)-mannosyltransferase activity toward α-(1→2)-mannobiose than α-(1→6)-mannobiose in vitro. Molecular simulations corroborated the fact that AnpA has a structure that can recognize the donor and acceptor substrates suitable for α-(1→6)-mannoside bond formation and that its catalytic activity would be specific for the elongation of the α-core-mannan structure <i>in vivo</i>. The identified AnpA is similar to Anp1p, which is involved in the elongation of the N-glycan outer chain in budding yeast, but the building sugar chain structure is different. The difference was attributed to the difference in substrate recognition of AnpA, which was clarified by simulations based on protein conformation. Thus, even proteins that seem to be functionally identical due to amino acid sequence similarity may be glycosyltransferase enzymes that make different glycans upon detailed analysis. This study describes an example of such a case. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Fungal-type galactomannan is a polysaccharide incorporated into the cell wall of filamentous fungi belonging to the subphylum Pezizomycotina.

The effects of the parasitoids and fungus were individually and jointly assessed in Plexiglas cages. Application of B. bassiana dry conidia to soil produced 40% mortality in A. obliqua adults. However, mortality was lower (21.2%) on evaluation under field cage conditions. According to the multiple decrement life table analysis, the probability of death of A. obliqua was 88% when C. haywardi parasitoids and B. bassiana conidia were used in conjunction, 89% when only C. haywardi parasitoids were released and 23% when only B. bassiana conidia were applied. These results demonstrate that no synergistic, additive or antagonistic interaction took place with the simultaneous use of these natural enemies, since the presence of B. bassiana had no effect on the C. haywardi parasitism. These results indicate that the parasitoid is a better natural enemy for the control of A. obliqua, and show that, although the two biological control agents can be used simultaneously, their joint application will not produce increased control.","The interaction between the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) and the parasitoid Coptera haywardi (Oglobin), as potential biological control agents for Anastrepha obliqua (Macquart) fruit flies, was evaluated under laboratory and semi-protected field cage conditions.

We aimed to develop a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted image analysis platform that quantifies cytokine-driven vascular inflammation from routine CT angiograms, and sought to validate its prognostic value in COVID-19.<h4>Methods</h4>For this prospective outcomes validation study, we developed a radiotranscriptomic platform that uses RNA sequencing data from human internal mammary artery biopsies to develop novel radiomic signatures of vascular inflammation from CT angiography images. We then used this platform to train a radiotranscriptomic signature (C19-RS), derived from the perivascular space around the aorta and the internal mammary artery, to best describe cytokine-driven vascular inflammation. The prognostic value of C19-RS was validated externally in 435 patients (331 from study arm 3 and 104 from study arm 4) admitted to hospital with or without COVID-19, undergoing clinically indicated pulmonary CT angiography, in three UK National Health Service (NHS) trusts (Oxford, Leicester, and Bath). We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic value of C19-RS for death in hospital due to COVID-19, did sensitivity analyses based on dexamethasone treatment, and investigated the correlation of C19-RS with systemic transcriptomic changes.<h4>Findings</h4>Patients with COVID-19 had higher C19-RS than those without (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2·97 [95% CI 1·43-6·27], p=0·0038), and those infected with the B.1.1.7 (alpha) SARS-CoV-2 variant had higher C19-RS values than those infected with the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 variant (adjusted OR 1·89 [95% CI 1·17-3·20] per SD, p=0·012). C19-RS had prognostic value for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 in two testing cohorts (high [≥6·99] vs low [<6·99] C19-RS; hazard ratio [HR] 3·31 [95% CI 1·49-7·33], p=0·0033; and 2·58 [1·10-6·05], p=0·028), adjusted for clinical factors, biochemical biomarkers of inflammation and myocardial injury, and technical parameters. The adjusted HR for in-hospital mortality was 8·24 (95% CI 2·16-31·36, p=0·0019) in patients who received no dexamethasone treatment, but 2·27 (0·69-7·55, p=0·18) in those who received dexamethasone after the scan, suggesting that vascular inflammation might have been a therapeutic target of dexamethasone in COVID-19. Finally, C19-RS was strongly associated (r=0·61, p=0·00031) with a whole blood transcriptional module representing dysregulation of coagulation and platelet aggregation pathways.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Radiotranscriptomic analysis of CT angiography scans introduces a potentially powerful new platform for the development of non-invasive imaging biomarkers. Application of this platform in routine CT pulmonary angiography scans done in patients with COVID-19 produced the radiotranscriptomic signature C19-RS, a marker of cytokine-driven inflammation driving systemic activation of coagulation and responsible for adverse clinical outcomes, which predicts in-hospital mortality and might allow targeted therapy.<h4>Funding</h4>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, British Heart Foundation, Oxford BHF Centre of Research Excellence, Innovate UK, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Wellcome Trust, Onassis Foundation.","<h4>Background</h4>Direct evaluation of vascular inflammation in patients with COVID-19 would facilitate more efficient trials of new treatments and identify patients at risk of long-term complications who might respond to treatment.

In past decades, research has focused on newer targeted agents with the aim of decreasing the rates of side effects on healthy cells. Unfortunately, even targeted anticancer therapies show significant rates of toxicity on healthy tissue. mTOR inhibitors display some adverse events, such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypophosphatemia, hematologic toxicities, and mucocutaneous eruption, but the most important are still stomatitis and skin rash, which are often dose-limiting side effects.<h4>Aim</h4>This review was performed to answer the question ""What is the incidence of stomatitis in patients treated with everolimus?""<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a systematic search on the PubMed and Medline online databases using a combination of MESH terms and free text: ""everolimus"" (MESH) AND ""side effects"" OR ""toxicities"" OR ""adverse events"". Only studies fulfilling the following inclusion criteria were considered eligible for inclusion in this study: performed on human subjects, reporting on the use of everolimus (even if in combination with other drugs or ionizing radiation), written in the English language, and reporting the incidence of side effects.<h4>Results</h4>The analysis of literature revealed that the overall incidence of stomatitis after treatment with everolimus was 42.6% (3,493) and that of stomatitis grade G1/2 84.02% (2,935), while G3/4 was 15.97% (558).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Results of the analysis showed that the incidence of stomatitis of grade 1 or 2 is higher than grade 3 or 4. However, it must be taken into account that it is not possible to say if side effects are entirely due to everolimus therapy or combinations with other drugs.","<h4>Background</h4>Oral toxicities, such as mucositis and stomatitis, are some of the most significant and unavoidable side effects associated with anticancer therapies.

Unfortunately, even targeted anticancer therapies show significant rates of toxicity on healthy tissue. mTOR inhibitors display some adverse events, such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypophosphatemia, hematologic toxicities, and mucocutaneous eruption, but the most important are still stomatitis and skin rash, which are often dose-limiting side effects.<h4>Aim</h4>This review was performed to answer the question ""What is the incidence of stomatitis in patients treated with everolimus?""<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a systematic search on the PubMed and Medline online databases using a combination of MESH terms and free text: ""everolimus"" (MESH) AND ""side effects"" OR ""toxicities"" OR ""adverse events"". Only studies fulfilling the following inclusion criteria were considered eligible for inclusion in this study: performed on human subjects, reporting on the use of everolimus (even if in combination with other drugs or ionizing radiation), written in the English language, and reporting the incidence of side effects.<h4>Results</h4>The analysis of literature revealed that the overall incidence of stomatitis after treatment with everolimus was 42.6% (3,493) and that of stomatitis grade G1/2 84.02% (2,935), while G3/4 was 15.97% (558).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Results of the analysis showed that the incidence of stomatitis of grade 1 or 2 is higher than grade 3 or 4. However, it must be taken into account that it is not possible to say if side effects are entirely due to everolimus therapy or combinations with other drugs.",EuropePMC

These secondary metabolites, derived from 3-deoxy flavonoids, are thought to have an important role in plants' resistance against various pathogens, e.g. by reducing fungal infection, and also to have beneficial effects on human and animal health due to their high antioxidant power. The aim of this work was to determine the role of phlobaphenes in reducing mycotoxin contamination on maize kernels. We analysed the effect of the P1 (pericarp color 1) gene on phlobaphenes accumulation, pericarp thickness and fumonisins accumulation. Analysing fumonisins accumulation in different genetic backgrounds through three seasons, we found a clear decrease of these toxins through the three years (Wilcoxon test, Z = 2.2, p = 0.0277) in coloured lines compared with the isogenic non-coloured ones. The coloured lines, carrying P1 allele showed an increase of phlobaphenes (about 10-14 fold) with respect to colourless lines. Furthermore there was a correlation between phlobaphenes accumulation and pericarp thickness (R = 0.9318; p = 0.0067). Taken together, these results suggest that the P1 gene plays a central role in regulating phlobaphenes accumulation in maize kernels, and indirectly, also tackles mycotoxins accumulation. The development and cultivation of corn varieties rich in phlobaphenes could be a powerful tool to reduce the loss of both quality and yield due to mycotoxin contamination, increasing the safety and the quality of the maize product.","Phlobaphenes are insoluble phenolic compounds which are accumulated in a limited number of tissues such as seed pericarp and cob glumes, conferring on them a typical red-brown pigmentation.

Despite proven success as a clinical target for azole antifungals, there is an urgent need to develop next-generation antifungals that target CYP51 to overcome the resistance of pathogenic fungi to existing azole drugs, toxic adverse reactions and drug interactions due to human drug-metabolizing CYPs. <i>Candida parapsilosis</i> is a readily transmitted opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes candidiasis in health care environments. In this study, we have characterised wild type <i>C. parapsilosis</i> CYP51 and its clinically significant, resistance-causing point mutation Y132F by expressing these enzymes in a <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> host system. In some cases, the enzymes were co-expressed with their cognate NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). Constitutive expression of CpCYP51 Y132F conferred a 10- to 12-fold resistance to fluconazole and voriconazole, reduced to ~6-fold resistance for the tetrazoles VT-1161 and VT-1129, but did not confer resistance to the long-tailed triazoles. Susceptibilities were unchanged in the case of CpCPR co-expression. Type II binding spectra showed tight triazole and tetrazole binding by affinity-purified recombinant CpCYP51. We report the X-ray crystal structure of ScCYP51 in complex with VT-1129 obtained at a resolution of 2.1 Å. Structural analysis of azole-enzyme interactions and functional studies of recombinant CYP51 from <i>C. parapsilosis</i> have improved understanding of their susceptibility to azole drugs and will help advance structure-directed antifungal discovery.","The fungal cytochrome P450 lanosterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51) is required for the biosynthesis of fungal-specific ergosterol and is the target of azole antifungal drugs.

Yet, the effects of invasive earthworms on defense traits of native plants from previously earthworm-free ecosystems as well as the consequences for multitrophic interactions are virtually unknown.Here we use a combination of an observational study and a complementary experimental study to investigate the effects of invasive earthworms on leaf defense traits, herbivore damage and pathogen infection in two poplar tree species (<i>Populus balsamifera</i> and <i>Populus tremuloides</i>) native to North American boreal forests.Our observational study showed that earthworm invasion was associated with enhanced leaf herbivory (by leaf-chewing insects) in saplings of both tree species. However, we only detected significant shifts in the concentration of chemical defense compounds in response to earthworm invasion for <i>P. balsamifera</i>. Specifically, leaf phenolic concentrations, including salicinoids and catechin, were lower in <i>P. balsamifera</i> from earthworm-invaded sites.Our experimental study confirmed an earthworm-induced reduction in leaf defense levels in <i>P. balsamifera</i> for one of the defense compounds, tremulacin. The experimental study additionally showed that invasive earthworms reduced leaf dry matter content, potentially increasing leaf palatability, and enhanced susceptibility of trees to infection by a fungal pathogen, but not to aphid infestation, in the same tree species. <i>Synthesis</i>. Our results show that invasive earthworms can decrease the concentrations of some chemical defense compounds in <i>P. balsamifera</i>, which could make them susceptible to leaf-chewing insects. Such potential impacts of invasive earthworms are likely to have implications for tree survival and competition, native tree biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.","Recent research shows that earthworms can alter defense traits of plants against herbivores and pathogens by affecting soil biochemistry.

Most frequently involved sites of mucormycosis are rhino-orbital, rhino-sinusal and rhino-orbito-cerebral. The hallmark sign of mucormycosis is tissue necrosis, which is often a late sign. The fatality rate of mucormycosis is 46% globally. Despite early aggressive combined surgical and medical therapy, the prognosis of mucormycosis is poor.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched the electronic database of PubMed, web of science, Embase, Scopus and Google Scholar from Jan 2020 until December 2021 using keywords. We retrieved all the granular details of original research articles, case reports/series of patients with rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM), and COVID-19 reported worldwide. Subsequently, we analyzed the patient characteristics, associated comorbidities, location of mucormycosis, treatment given and its outcome in people with COVID-19.

10.1111/mpp.12867,Suppression of abscisic acid biosynthesis at the early infection stage of Verticillium longisporum in oilseed rape (Brassica napus).,"Verticillium longisporum infects oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and Arabidopsis thaliana. To investigate the early response of oilseed rape to the fungal infection, we determined transcriptomic changes in oilseed rape roots at 6 days post-inoculation (dpi) by RNA-Seq analysis, in which non-infected roots served as a control. Strikingly, a subset of genes involved in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis was found to be down-regulated and the ABA level was accordingly attenuated in 6 dpi oilseed rape as compared with the control. Gene expression analysis revealed that this was mainly attributed to the suppression of BnNCED3-mediated ABA biosynthesis, involving, for example, BnWRKY57. However, this down-regulation of ABA biosynthesis could not be observed in infected Arabidopsis roots. Arabidopsis ABA- defective mutants nced3 and aao3 displayed pronounced tolerance to the fungal infection with delayed and impeded symptom development, even though fungal colonization was not affected in both mutants. These data suggest that ABA appears to be required for full susceptibility of Arabidopsis to the fungal infection. Furthermore, we found that in both 6 dpi oilseed rape and the Arabidopsis nced3 mutant, the salicylic acid (SA) signalling pathway was induced while the jasmonic acid (JA)/ethylene (ET) signalling pathway was concomitantly mitigated. Following these data, we conclude that in oilseed rape the V. longisporum infection triggers a host-specific suppression of the NCED3-mediated ABA biosynthesis, consequently increasing plant tolerance to the fungal infection. We believe that this might be part of the virulence strategy of V. longisporum to initiate/establish a long-lasting compatible interaction with oilseed rape (coexistence), which appears to be different from the infection process in Arabidopsis.","Verticillium longisporum infects oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and Arabidopsis thaliana.

10.1098/rsos.220247,Enhanced durability of round bamboo treated with copper naphthenate under heat-cold impregnation.,"Round bamboo has aroused much interest in construction for its mechanical properties, but poor biological durability seriously restricts its application. In order to develop a suitable and effective preservative treatment method for round bamboo, copper naphthenate (CuN) was adopted and impregnated into round bamboo using heat-cold procedure. The distribution and retention of copper naphthenate in round bamboo were studied, and the biological durability represented by the mould and decay resistance were investigated. The results showed that the retention and fixation of copper reached 0.39 kg⋅m<sup>-3</sup> and 85.3%, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry further disclosed an increasing trend in the composition of CuN from the end inward. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses later revealed that CuN could be fixed on bamboo in the form of hydrogen bond or complex reaction. Statistical analysis showed that the increasing concentration of CuN from 0.3% to 0.5% and 0.8% (calculated as Cu<sup>2+</sup> content) has significant contribution against <i>Trametes versicolor</i> and <i>Gloeophyllum trabeum</i> in comparison with the untreated bamboo. Meanwhile, when the concentration of treating solution increased to 0.8 wt%, the resisting efficacy for <i>Aspergillus niger</i>, <i>Penicillium citrinum</i> and <i>Trichoderma viride</i> soared as high as 85.9%, 94.8% and 70.3%, respectively.","Round bamboo has aroused much interest in construction for its mechanical properties, but poor biological durability seriously restricts its application.

However, some of B. bassiana isolates show similar morphology and virulence against insect pests, and so it is hard to differentiate them. Herein we used two patented isolates, ERL836 and JEF-007, and investigated their virulence against western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, and further analyzed genome structures and transcriptional responses when interacting with cuticles of thrips to see possible differences on the initial step of fungal infection.<h4>Results</h4>The two isolates showed no significant differences in fungal growth, conidial production, and virulence against thrips, and they were structurally similar in genome. But, in transcription level, ERL836 appeared to infect thrips easily, while JEF-007 appeared to have more difficulty. In the GO analysis of ERL836 DEGs (differentially expressed genes), the number of up-regulated genes was much larger than that of down-regulated genes, when compared to JEF-007 DEGs (more genes down-regulated). Interestingly, in the enrichment analysis using shared DEGs between two infecting isolates, plasma membrane-mediated transporter activity and fatty acid degradation pathway including cytochrome P450 were more active in infecting ERL836.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The two B. bassiana isolates had similar morphology and virulence as well as genome structure, but in transcription level they differently interacted with the cuticle of western flower thrips. This comparative approach using shared DEG analysis could be easily applied to characterize the difference of the two B. bassiana isolates, JEF-007 and ERL836.","<h4>Background</h4>Insect-killing fungal species, Beauveria bassiana, is as an environment-friendly pest management tool, and many isolates are on the track of industrialization.

10.1002/ece3.7815,Condition-dependent male copulatory courtship and its benefits for females.,"Postcopulatory sexual selection has shaped the ornaments used during copulatory courtship. However, we know relatively little about whether these courtship ornaments are costly to produce or whether they provide indirect benefits to females. We used the mealworm beetle, <i>Tenebrio molitor</i>, to explore this. We challenged males using an entomopathogenic fungus and compared their courtship (frequency of leg and antennal contacts to the female), copulation duration, number of eggs laid, and hatching rate against control males. Infected males copulated for longer yet they reduced their leg and antennal contacts compared to control males. However, there was no obvious relation between infection, copulation duration, and courtship with egg production and hatching success. In general, our results indicate that the ornaments used during postcopulatory courtship are condition-dependent. Moreover, such condition dependence cannot be linked to male fitness.","Postcopulatory sexual selection has shaped the ornaments used during copulatory courtship.

Schott Inhibits <i>Trichophyton rubrum</i> Growth via Membrane Permeability Alternation and Ergosterol Biosynthesis Disruption.,"Isoflavaspidic acid PB (PB), a phloroglucinol derivative extracted from aerial parts of <i>Dryopteris fragrans</i> (L.) Schott, had antifungal activity against several dermatophytes. This study was aimed at exploring the antifungal mechanism of PB against <i>Trichophyton rubrum</i> (<i>T. rubrum</i>). The effectiveness of PB in inhibiting <i>T. rubrum</i> growth was detected by time-kill kinetics study and fungal biomass determination. Studies on the mechanism of action were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), sorbitol and ergosterol assay, nucleotide leakage measurement, and UPLC-based test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fungicidal activity of PB was concentration- and time-dependent at 2 × MIC (MIC: 20 <i>μ</i>g/mL) after 36 h. The total biomass of <i>T. rubrum</i> was reduced by 64.17%, 77.65%, and 84.71% in the presence of PB at 0.5 × MIC, 1 × MIC, and 2 × MIC, respectively. SEM analysis showed that PB changed mycelial morphology, such as shrinking, twisting, collapsing, and even flattening. TEM images of treated cells exhibited abnormal distributions of polysaccharide particles, plasmolysis, and cytoplasmic content degradation accompanied by plasmalemma disruption. There were no changes in the MIC of PB in the presence of sorbitol. However, the MIC values of PB were increased by 4-fold with exogenous ergosterol. At 4 h and 8 h, PB increased nucleotide leakage. Besides, ergosterol content in <i>T. rubrum</i> membrane treated with PB at 0.5 × MIC, 1 × MIC, and 2 × MIC was decreased by 9.58%, 15.31%, and 76.24%, respectively. There was a dose-dependent decrease in the squalene epoxidase (SE) activity. And the reduction in the sterol 14<i>α</i>-demethylase P450 (CYP51) activity was achieved after PB treatments at 1 × MIC and 2 × MIC. These results suggest that PB displays nonspecific action on the cell wall. The membrane damaging effects of PB were attributed to binding with ergosterol to increase membrane permeability and interfering ergosterol biosynthesis involved with the reduction of SE and CYP51 activities.

10.1093/humupd/dmac025,Bioengineering trends in female reproduction: a systematic review.,"<h4>Background</h4>To provide the optimal milieu for implantation and fetal development, the female reproductive system must orchestrate uterine dynamics with the appropriate hormones produced by the ovaries. Mature oocytes may be fertilized in the fallopian tubes, and the resulting zygote is transported toward the uterus, where it can implant and continue developing. The cervix acts as a physical barrier to protect the fetus throughout pregnancy, and the vagina acts as a birth canal (involving uterine and cervix mechanisms) and facilitates copulation. Fertility can be compromised by pathologies that affect any of these organs or processes, and therefore, being able to accurately model them or restore their function is of paramount importance in applied and translational research. However, innate differences in human and animal model reproductive tracts, and the static nature of 2D cell/tissue culture techniques, necessitate continued research and development of dynamic and more complex in vitro platforms, ex vivo approaches and in vivo therapies to study and support reproductive biology. To meet this need, bioengineering is propelling the research on female reproduction into a new dimension through a wide range of potential applications and preclinical models, and the burgeoning number and variety of studies makes for a rapidly changing state of the field.<h4>Objective and rationale</h4>This review aims to summarize the mounting evidence on bioengineering strategies, platforms and therapies currently available and under development in the context of female reproductive medicine, in order to further understand female reproductive biology and provide new options for fertility restoration. Specifically, techniques used in, or for, the uterus (endometrium and myometrium), ovary, fallopian tubes, cervix and vagina will be discussed.<h4>Search methods</h4>A systematic search of full-text articles available in PubMed and Embase databases was conducted to identify relevant studies published between January 2000 and September 2021. The search terms included: bioengineering, reproduction, artificial, biomaterial, microfluidic, bioprinting, organoid, hydrogel, scaffold, uterus, endometrium, ovary, fallopian tubes, oviduct, cervix, vagina, endometriosis, adenomyosis, uterine fibroids, chlamydia, Asherman's syndrome, intrauterine adhesions, uterine polyps, polycystic ovary syndrome and primary ovarian insufficiency. Additional studies were identified by manually searching the references of the selected articles and of complementary reviews. Eligibility criteria included original, rigorous and accessible peer-reviewed work, published in English, on female reproductive bioengineering techniques in preclinical (in vitro/in vivo/ex vivo) and/or clinical testing phases.<h4>Outcomes</h4>Out of the 10 390 records identified, 312 studies were included for systematic review. Owing to inconsistencies in the study measurements and designs, the findings were assessed qualitatively rather than by meta-analysis. Hydrogels and scaffolds were commonly applied in various bioengineering-related studies of the female reproductive tract. Emerging technologies, such as organoids and bioprinting, offered personalized diagnoses and alternative treatment options, respectively. Promising microfluidic systems combining various bioengineering approaches have also shown translational value.<h4>Wider implications</h4>The complexity of the molecular, endocrine and tissue-level interactions regulating female reproduction present challenges for bioengineering approaches to replace female reproductive organs. However, interdisciplinary work is providing valuable insight into the physicochemical properties necessary for reproductive biological processes to occur. Defining the landscape of reproductive bioengineering technologies currently available and under development for women can provide alternative models for toxicology/drug testing, ex vivo fertility options, clinical therapies and a basis for future organ regeneration studies.","<h4>Background</h4>To provide the optimal milieu for implantation and fetal development, the female reproductive system must orchestrate uterine dynamics with the appropriate hormones produced by the ovaries.

Thus, fungal infections of preharvested crops and stored food by plant pathogens such as <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> and <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> can have detrimental socioeconomic effects due to food insecurity. Current antifungal strategies are based mainly on small molecule antifungal drugs. However, these drugs are limited by poor solubility and bioavailability. Furthermore, antifungal resistance against these drugs are on the rise. Thus, antimicrobial polymers offer an alternative antifungal strategy. Antifungal polymers are characterised by cationic and hydrophobic regions where the cationic regions have been shown to interact with microbial phospholipids and membranes. These polymers can be synthetic or natural and demonstrate distinct antifungal mechanisms ranging from fungal cell membrane permeabilisation, cell membrane depolarisation or cell entry. Although the relative importance of such mechanisms is difficult to decipher. Due to the chemical properties of these polymers, they can be combined with other antimicrobial compounds including existing antifungal drugs, charcoals, lipids and metal ions to elicit synergistic effects. In some cases, antifungal polymers and nanocomposites show better antifungal effects or reduced toxicity compared to the widely used small molecule antifungal drugs.

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of emodin on acute lung injury (ALI) in rats with SAP and investigate the role of the Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and its association with neutrophil recruitment. Sodium taurocholate (5.0%) was used to establish the SAP model. All animals were randomly assigned into four groups: Sham, SAP, emodin and dexamethasone (positive control drug) groups (n=10 mice per group). Histopathology observation of pancreatic and lung tissues was detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The levels of serum amylase, IL-1β and IL-18 were measured by ELISA. Single-cell suspensions were obtained from enzymatically digested lung tissues, followed by flow cytometric analysis for apoptosis. In addition, the expression levels of NLRP3 inflammasome-associated and apoptosis-associated proteins in lung tissues were measured by western blotting. Moreover, lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus G6D<sup>+</sup> (Ly6G<sup>+</sup>) cell recruitment was detected using immunohistochemical analysis. The results revealed that emodin markedly improved pancreatic histological injury and decreased the levels of serum amylase, IL-1β and IL-18. Pulmonary edema and apoptosis were significantly alleviated by emodin. Additionally, the protein expression levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD and cleaved caspase-1 were downregulated following emodin treatment. Moreover, emodin inhibited Ly6G<sup>+</sup> cell recruitment in lung tissues. The present study demonstrated that emodin may offer protection against ALI induced by SAP via inhibiting and suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neutrophil recruitment and may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the clinical treatment of ALI.","Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) activates the systemic inflammatory response and is potentially lethal.

Single-cell suspensions were obtained from enzymatically digested lung tissues, followed by flow cytometric analysis for apoptosis. In addition, the expression levels of NLRP3 inflammasome-associated and apoptosis-associated proteins in lung tissues were measured by western blotting. Moreover, lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus G6D<sup>+</sup> (Ly6G<sup>+</sup>) cell recruitment was detected using immunohistochemical analysis. The results revealed that emodin markedly improved pancreatic histological injury and decreased the levels of serum amylase, IL-1β and IL-18. Pulmonary edema and apoptosis were significantly alleviated by emodin. Additionally, the protein expression levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD and cleaved caspase-1 were downregulated following emodin treatment. Moreover, emodin inhibited Ly6G<sup>+</sup> cell recruitment in lung tissues. The present study demonstrated that emodin may offer protection against ALI induced by SAP via inhibiting and suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neutrophil recruitment and may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the clinical treatment of ALI.",EuropePMC
10.3389/fbioe.2022.846632,The Growing Medical Need for Tracheal Replacement: Reconstructive Strategies Should Overcome Their Limits.,"Breathing, being predominantly an automatic action, is often taken for granted. However, respiratory diseases affect millions of people globally, emerging as one of the major causes of disability and death overall. Among the respiratory dysfunctions, tracheal alterations have always represented a primary challenge for clinicians, biologists, and engineers. Indeed, in the case of wide structural alterations involving more than 50% of the tracheal length in adults or 30% in children, the available medical treatments are ineffective or inapplicable. So far, a plethora of reconstructive approaches have been proposed and clinically applied to face this growing, unmet medical need. Unfortunately, none of them has become a well-established and routinely applied clinical procedure to date. This review summarizes the main clinical reconstructive attempts and classifies them as non-tissue engineering and tissue engineering strategies. The analysis of the achievements and the main difficulties that still hinder this field, together with the evaluation of the forefront preclinical experiences in tracheal repair/replacement, is functional to promote a safer and more effective clinical translation in the near future.","Breathing, being predominantly an automatic action, is often taken for granted.

10.1007/s12105-018-0965-8,Acute Invasive Fungal Rhinosinusitis: Frozen Section Histomorphology and Diagnosis with PAS Stain.,"Acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (AIFRS) is a fulminant infection in immunocompromised patients requiring rapid diagnosis (DX), frequently made on frozen section (FS) of sinonasal biopsies, followed by prompt surgical debridement. However, FS interpretation is often difficult and DX sometimes not possible. In this study we sought to characterize reasons for misinterpretation and methods to improve diagnostic accuracy. The FS slides from 271 biopsies of suspected AIFRS in a 16-year period were reviewed and the morphologic features evaluated for their utility in DX. Recurring specific patterns of necrosis were identified, which to our knowledge have not been described in the literature. Although they provide strong evidence for AIFRS, identifying fungus consistently in necrotic tissue is essential for DX. Clues to identifying fungus and pitfalls in misidentification were identified, but even with expert knowledge of these, a gap in accurate DX remained. The key to FS DX of AIFRS is to improve fungus identification in necrotic tissues. Methods had been sought in the past to stain fungus at FS without consistent success. The Periodic Acid Schiff's Reaction for Fungi was modified by our histopathology department for use on frozen tissue (PASF-fs) resulting in effective staining of the fungus. It stained fungus on all 62 positive slides when applied retrospectively over hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained FSs and used prospectively at FS for DX.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects and mechanisms of action of C tropicalis infection on intestinal inflammation and injury in mice.<h4>Methods</h4>C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with C tropicalis, and colitis was induced by administration of dextran sodium sulfate in drinking water. Disease severity and intestinal permeability subsequently were evaluated by endoscopy, histology, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, as well as 16S ribosomal RNA and NanoString analyses (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA).<h4>Results</h4>Infected mice showed more severe colitis, with alterations in gut mucosal helper T cells (Th)1 and Th17 cytokine expression, and an increased frequency of mesenteric lymph node-derived group 2 innate lymphoid cells compared with uninfected controls. Gut microbiome composition, including changes in the mucin-degrading bacteria, Akkermansia muciniphila and Ruminococcus gnavus, was altered significantly, as was expression of several genes affecting intestinal epithelial homeostasis in isolated colonoids, after C tropicalis infection compared with uninfected controls. In line with these findings, fecal microbiome transplantation of germ-free recipient mice using infected vs uninfected donors showed altered expression of several tight-junction proteins and increased susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>C tropicalis induces dysbiosis that involves changes in the presence of mucin-degrading bacteria, leading to altered tight junction protein expression with increased intestinal permeability and followed by induction of robust Th1/Th17 responses, which ultimately lead to an accelerated proinflammatory phenotype in experimental colitic mice.","<h4>Background & aims</h4>We previously showed that abundance of Candida tropicalis is significantly greater in Crohn's disease patients compared with first-degree relatives without Crohn's disease.

Although procalcitonin and presepsin have been identified as potential biomarkers to differentiate between sepsis and other non-infectious causes of systemic inflammation, the diagnostic accuracy of these biomarkers remains controversial. Herein, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to assess the overall diagnostic value of procalcitonin and presepsin for the diagnosis of sepsis.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched three electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) for relevant studies. Two authors independently screened articles on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and summary receiver operating characteristic curves were estimated. The quality of evidence for diagnostic accuracy in absolute effects, i.e., the number of true or false positives and true or false negatives, gave a particular pre-test probability.<h4>Results</h4>We included 19 studies (19 observational studies and no randomized controlled trials) that had enrolled 3012 patients. Analyses of summary receiver operating characteristic curves revealed areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.84 for procalcitonin and 0.87 for presepsin.

On the surface of mast cells, the crosslinking of IgE bound to FcεRI by a specific antigen recognized by that IgE triggers the release of immune mediators such as histamine and cytokines capable of activating other immune cells; however, little is known about the mast cell contribution to the induction of endogenous, antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Here we examined the effects of specific mast cell activation in vivo on the initiation of an antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response. While CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were not enhanced by FcεRI stimulation alone, their activation was synergistically enhanced when FcεRI activation was combined with TLR4 stimulation. This enhanced activation was dependent on global TLR4 stimulation but appeared to be less dependent on mast cell expressed TLR4. This study provides important new evidence to support the role of mast cells as mediators of the antigen-specific adaptive immune response.","Mast cells are potent mediators of allergy and asthma, yet their role in regulating adaptive immunity remains ambiguous.

However, costs accrue rapidly as body temperature rises. Thus, the magnitude of adaptive fever responses might reflect the balance of costs and benefits. We investigated behavioural fever in desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria, infected with the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium acridum. We first tracked the time course of behavioural fever in infected locusts, demonstrating that body temperatures rose on the day following inoculation (day 1), and reached peak intensity on the day after that (day 2). Subsequently, the magnitude of fever responses varied during a day, and locusts tended to exhibit high-intensity fever responses in the mornings when basking was first possible. We speculate that this may have resulted from increased fungal load caused by unimpeded growth overnight when locusts could not fever. We next inoculated locusts with different M. acridum doses ranging from 0 to ca. 75,000 conidia. The magnitude of their behavioural fever responses on day 2 post-inoculation was positively related to fungal dose. Thus, we demonstrate dose-dependency in the behavioural fever responses of desert locusts and suggest that this may reflect the adaptive deployment of behavioural fever to minimize costs relative to benefits.","Behavioural fever is a common response to immune challenge in ectotherms and confers survival benefits.

10.1111/mpp.13324,"Site-specific analysis reveals candidate cross-kingdom small RNAs, tRNA and rRNA fragments, and signs of fungal RNA phasing in the barley-powdery mildew interaction.","The establishment of host-microbe interactions requires molecular communication between both partners, which may involve the mutual transfer of noncoding small RNAs. Previous evidence suggests that this is also true for powdery mildew disease in barley, which is caused by the fungal pathogen Blumeria hordei. However, previous studies lacked spatial resolution regarding the accumulation of small RNAs upon host infection by B. hordei. Here, we analysed site-specific small RNA repertoires in the context of the barley-B. hordei interaction. To this end, we dissected infected leaves into separate fractions representing different sites that are key to the pathogenic process: epiphytic fungal mycelium, infected plant epidermis, isolated haustoria, a vesicle-enriched fraction from infected epidermis, and extracellular vesicles. Unexpectedly, we discovered enrichment of specific 31-33-base 5'-terminal fragments of barley 5.8S ribosomal RNA in extracellular vesicles and infected epidermis, as well as particular B. hordei transfer RNA fragments in haustoria. We describe canonical small RNAs from both the plant host and the fungal pathogen that may confer cross-kingdom RNA interference activity. Interestingly, we found first evidence of phased small interfering RNAs in B. hordei, a feature usually attributed to plants, which may be associated with the posttranscriptional control of fungal coding genes, pseudogenes, and transposable elements. Our data suggest a key and possibly site-specific role for cross-kingdom RNA interference and noncoding RNA fragments in the host-pathogen communication between B. hordei and its host barley.","The establishment of host-microbe interactions requires molecular communication between both partners, which may involve the mutual transfer of noncoding small RNAs.

With exquisitely tunable physical properties that confer them great controlled drug release features and the merits they offer for labile drug protection from degradation, hydrogels emerge as very efficient drug delivery systems. The versatility and diversity of the hydrogels extend their applications beyond targeted drug delivery also to wound dressings, contact lenses and tissue engineering to name but a few. They are 90% water, and highly porous to accommodate drugs for delivery and facilitate controlled release. Herein we discuss hydrogels and how they could be manipulated for targeted drug delivery applications. Suitable examples from the literature are provided that support the recent advancements of hydrogels in targeted drug delivery in diverse disease areas and how they could be suitably modified in very different ways for achieving significant impact in targeted drug delivery. With their enormous amenability to modification, hydrogels serve as promising delivery vehicles of therapeutic molecules in several disease conditions, including cancer and diabetes.","Conventional drug delivery approaches are plagued by issues pertaining to systemic toxicity and repeated dosing.

10.3389/fimmu.2022.863234,Immunoinformatic Design of a Multivalent Peptide Vaccine Against Mucormycosis: Targeting FTR1 Protein of Major Causative Fungi.,"Mucormycosis is a potentially fatal illness that arises in immunocompromised people due to diabetic ketoacidosis, neutropenia, organ transplantation, and elevated serum levels of accessible iron. The sudden spread of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients engendered massive concern worldwide. Comorbidities including diabetes, cancer, steroid-based medications, long-term ventilation, and increased ferritin serum concentration in COVID-19 patients trigger favorable fungi growth that in turn effectuate mucormycosis. The necessity of <i>FTR1</i> gene-encoded ferrous permease for host iron acquisition by fungi has been found in different studies recently. Thus, targeting the transit component could be a potential solution. Unfortunately, no appropriate antifungal vaccine has been constructed as of yet. To date, mucormycosis has been treated with antiviral therapy and surgical treatment only. Thus, in this study, the FTR1 protein has been targeted to design a convenient and novel epitope-based vaccine with the help of immunoinformatics against four different virulent fungal species. Furthermore, the vaccine was constructed using 8 CTL, 2 HTL, and 1 LBL epitopes that were found to be highly antigenic, non-allergenic, non-toxic, and fully conserved among the fungi under consideration. The vaccine has very reassuring stability due to its high pI value of 9.97, conclusive of a basic range. The vaccine was then subjected to molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and immune simulation studies to confirm the biological environment's safety, efficacy, and stability. The vaccine constructs were found to be safe in addition to being effective. Finally, we used <i>in-silico</i> cloning to develop an effective strategy for vaccine mass production. The designed vaccine will be a potential therapeutic not only to control mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients but also be effective in general mucormycosis events. However, further <i>in vitro</i>, and <i>in vivo</i> testing is needed to confirm the vaccine's safety and efficacy in controlling fungal infections. If successful, this vaccine could provide a low-cost and effective method of preventing the spread of mucormycosis worldwide.","Mucormycosis is a potentially fatal illness that arises in immunocompromised people due to diabetic ketoacidosis, neutropenia, organ transplantation, and elevated serum levels of accessible iron.

10.1038/s41598-017-05800-4,Increased Male-Male Mounting Behaviour in Desert Locusts during Infection with an Entomopathogenic Fungus.,"Same-sex sexual behaviour occurs across diverse animal taxa, but adaptive explanations can be difficult to determine. Here we investigate male-male mounting (MMM) behaviour in female-deprived desert locust males infected with the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium acridum. Over a four-week period, infected locusts performed more MMM behaviours than healthy controls. Among infected locusts, the probability of MMM, and the duration of time spent MMM, significantly increased with the mounting locust's proximity to death. In experimental trials, infected locusts were also significantly more likely than controls to attempt to mount healthy males. Therefore, we demonstrate that MMM is more frequent among infected than healthy male locusts, and propose that this may be explained by terminal reproductive effort and a lowered mate acceptance threshold in infected males. However, during experimental trials mounting attempts were more likely to be successful if the mounted locusts were experimentally manipulated to have a reduced capacity to escape. Thus, reduced escape capability resulting from infection may also contribute to the higher frequency of MMM among infected male locusts. Our data demonstrate that pathogen infection can affect same-sex sexual behaviour, and suggest that the impact of such behaviours on host and pathogen fitness will be a novel focus for future research.","Same-sex sexual behaviour occurs across diverse animal taxa, but adaptive explanations can be difficult to determine.

Optimized formulation (CDN5) had a particle size of 320 nm with a zeta potential of -35.5 mV and 87% EE. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) depicted porous and non-spherical shaped beads. No evidence of chemical interaction was evident in FT-IR studies, whereas distinctive high-intensity VRC peaks were found superimposed in XRD. A stable polymeric network formation was evident in DSC studies owing to a lower breakdown in VRC loaded HPβCD in comparison to blank HPβCD. In vitro release studies showed 91 and 92% drug release for optimized formulation at pH 1.2 and 6.8, respectively, with first-order kinetics as the best-fit model and non-Fickian diffusion as the release mechanism. No evidence of toxicity was observed upon oral administration of HPβCD loaded VRC polymeric nanobeads owing to with cellular morphology of vital organs as observed in histopathology.

The reference lists of studies published from 2000 till June 2020 were hand searched.<h4>Result</h4>On screening 2088 articles, a total of five RCTs with 6,277 patients were included in this review. Only one clinical trial compared early PN and late PN; the results reported significantly shorter periods in intensive care unit (ICU) stay (p=0.02) and less ICU related infections (p=0.008) in the late PN group compared to the Early PN group. Two trials compared total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and enteral nutrition (EN) +TPN groups.

10.4239/wjd.v13.i10.809,Growing importance of urogenital candidiasis in individuals with diabetes: A narrative review.,"Both diabetes and fungal infections contribute significantly to the global disease burden, with increasing trends seen in most developed and developing countries during recent decades. This is reflected in urogenital infections caused by <i>Candida</i> species that are becoming ever more pervasive in diabetic patients, particularly those that present with unsatisfactory glycemic control. In addition, a relatively new group of anti-hyperglycemic drugs, known as sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, has been linked with an increased risk for colonization of the urogenital region with <i>Candida</i> spp., which can subsequently lead to an infectious process. In this review paper, we have highlighted notable virulence factors of <i>Candida</i> species (with an emphasis on <i>Candida albicans</i>) and shown how the interplay of many pathophysiological factors can give rise to vulvovaginal candidiasis, potentially complicated with recurrences and dire pregnancy outcomes. We have also addressed an increased risk of candiduria and urinary tract infections caused by species of <i>Candida</i> in females and males with diabetes, further highlighting possible complications such as emphysematous cystitis as well as the risk for the development of balanitis and balanoposthitis in (primarily uncircumcised) males. With a steadily increasing global burden of diabetes, urogenital mycotic infections will undoubtedly become more prevalent in the future; hence, there is a need for an evidence-based approach from both clinical and public health perspectives.","Both diabetes and fungal infections contribute significantly to the global disease burden, with increasing trends seen in most developed and developing countries during recent decades.

A primary factor in WNS-associated bat mortality includes increased arousals from torpor and premature fat depletion during winter months. Details of species and sex-specific changes in lipid metabolism during WNS are poorly understood and may play an important role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Given the likely role of fat metabolism in WNS and the fact that the liver plays a crucial role in fatty acid distribution and lipid storage, we assessed hepatic lipid signatures of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) and big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) at an early stage of infection with the etiological agent, Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd). Differences in lipid profiles were detected at the species and sex level in the sham-inoculated treatment, most strikingly in higher hepatic triacylglyceride (TG) levels in E. fuscus females compared to males. Interestingly, several dominant TGs (storage lipids) decreased dramatically after Pd infection in both female M. lucifugus and E. fuscus. Increases in hepatic glycerophospholipid (structural lipid) levels were only observed in M. lucifugus, including two phosphatidylcholines (PC [32:1], PC [42:6]) and one phosphatidylglycerol (PG [34:1]). These results suggest that even at early stages of WNS, changes in hepatic lipid mobilization may occur and be species and sex specific. As pre-hibernation lipid reserves may aid in bat persistence and survival during WNS, these early perturbations to lipid metabolism could have important implications for management responses that aid in pre-hibernation fat storage.","White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emergent wildlife fungal disease of cave-dwelling, hibernating bats that has led to unprecedented mortalities throughout North America.

Reducing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress are essential strategies for SCI treatment. Some compounds from traditional medicine could be useful to decrease ROS generated after SCI. This review is aimed at highlighting the importance of some natural compounds with antioxidant capacity used in traditional medicine to treat traumatic SCI. An electronic search of published articles describing animal models of SCI treated with natural compounds from traditional medicine was conducted using the following terms: Spinal Cord Injuries (MeSH terms) AND Models, Animal (MeSH terms) AND [Reactive Oxygen Species (MeSH terms) AND/OR Oxidative Stress (MeSH term)] AND Medicine, Traditional (MeSH terms). Articles reported from 2010 to 2018 were included. The results were further screened by title and abstract for studies performed in rats, mice, and nonhuman primates. The effects of these natural compounds are discussed, including their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties. Moreover, the antioxidant properties of natural compounds were emphasized since oxidative stress has a fundamental role in the generation and progression of several pathologies of the nervous system. The use of these compounds diminishes toxic effects due to their high antioxidant capacity. These compounds have been tested in animal models with promising results; however, no clinical studies have been conducted in humans. Further research of these natural compounds is crucial to a better understanding of their effects in patients with SCI.","Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) face devastating health, social, and financial consequences, as well as their families and caregivers.

The topical therapy is less effective but causes fewer side effects. This is why the development of an effective, easy to apply formulation for topical treatment is of high importance. We have used a nanotechnological approach to formulate Pickering emulsions (PEs) with well-defined properties to achieve site-specific delivery for antifungal drug combination of tioconazole and <i>Melaleuca alternifolia</i> essential oil. Silica nanoparticles with tailored size and partially hydrophobic surface have been synthesized and used for the stabilization of PEs. In vitro diffusion studies have been performed to evaluate the drug delivery properties of PEs. Ethanolic solution (ES) and conventional emulsions (CE) have been used as reference drug formulations. The examination of the antifungal effect of PEs has been performed on <i>Candida albicans</i> and <i>Trichophyton rubrum</i> as main pathogens. In vitro microbiological experimental results suggest that PEs are better candidates for onychomycosis topical treatment than CE or ES of the examined drugs.

10.1086/701434,Priority Effects and Nonhierarchical Competition Shape Species Composition in a Complex Grassland Community.,"Niche and fitness differences control the outcome of competition, but determining their relative importance in invaded communities-which may be far from equilibrium-remains a pressing concern. Moreover, it is unclear whether classic approaches for studying competition, which were developed predominantly for pairs of interacting species, will fully capture dynamics in complex species assemblages. We parameterized a population-dynamic model using competition experiments of two native and three exotic species from a grassland community. We found evidence for minimal fitness differences or niche differences between the native species, leading to slow replacement dynamics and priority effects, but large fitness advantages allowed exotics to unconditionally invade natives. Priority effects driven by strong interspecific competition between exotic species drove single-species dominance by one of two exotic species in 80% of model outcomes, while a complex mixture of nonhierarchical competition and coexistence between native and exotic species occurred in the remaining 20%. Fungal infection, a commonly hypothesized coexistence mechanism, had weak fitness effects and is unlikely to substantially affect coexistence. In contrast to previous work on pairwise outcomes in largely native-dominated communities, our work supports a role for nearly neutral dynamics and priority effects as drivers of species composition in invaded communities.","Niche and fitness differences control the outcome of competition, but determining their relative importance in invaded communities-which may be far from equilibrium-remains a pressing concern.

The association of natural products and nanotechnology is important to improve the antifungal potential of medicinal plants. We aimed to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo anti-<i>Candida albicans</i> activity of unloaded (EO) and loaded (ME+EO) essential oil of <i>Cymbopogon nardus</i> in the microemulsion (ME).<h4>Methods</h4>The chemical analysis of the EO was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The ME and ME+EO were characterized by scattering, zeta potential, polarized light microscopy, rheological assays, mucoadhesiveness and transmission electronic microscopy. The in vitro antifungal activity of the EO and ME+EO were evaluated by microdilution technique. The toxicity of EO and ME+EO was analyzed on human cell line HaCat and using alternative model assay with <i>Artemia salina</i>. The experimental in vivo VVC was performed in female mice (C57BL/6).<h4>Results</h4>The main compounds of the EO were found to be citronellal, geranial, geraniol, citronellol, and neral. The formulations exhibited suitable size, homogeneity, negative charge, isotropic behavior, highly organized structure, and pseudoplastic behavior, for vaginal application. TEM photomicrographs showed possible EO droplets inside the spherical structures. The EO, when loaded into the ME, exhibited an improvement in its antifungal action against <i>C. albicans</i>. The EO was not toxic against brine shrimp nauplii. An in vivo VVC assay showed that the use of the ME significantly improved the action of the EO, since only the ME+EO promoted the eradication of the fungal vaginal infection on the third day of treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The EO and ME+EO are promising alternatives for the control of fungal infections caused by <i>C. albicans</i>, once the use of nanotechnology significantly improved the antifungal action of the EO, especially in an in vivo model of VVC.","<h4>Purpose</h4>Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is an opportunistic fungal infection that adversely affects a woman's health, due to unpleasant symptoms, therapeutic challenges, and the emergence of resistant strains.

10.2147/ceor.s139949,The value of corneoscleral rim cultures in keratoplasty: a systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>This study evaluated the performance of donor corneoscleral rim cultures for predicting infection after corneal transplantation, and determines if there is a correlation between positive corneoscleral rim cultures and postkeratoplasty infection.<h4>Design and data sources</h4>This was a systematic review, prognostic accuracy analysis, and cost-effectiveness analysis. Databases searched were: Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and BioSis Previews. Grey literature was also explored.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A systematic review was conducted to locate published and unpublished studies. All studies examining corneal button contamination and its association with endophthalmitis and keratitis posttransplantation were included. Extracted data were used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Cost data from the London Laboratory Services Group in London, ON were used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of culturing donor rim cultures.<h4>Results</h4>Of 7,870 grafts, 954 had a positive rim culture (12.1%), with 12 patients going on to develop keratitis or endophthalmitis (1.3%). The prevalence of keratitis and endophthalmitis in this study was 0.15%, and the positive predictive value 1.5%. Of the 12 infections, nine were fungal and three bacterial. The estimated cost of a positive and negative test result was CAD$45.99 and $14.15, respectively. The cost to run all 7,870 tests was estimated to be $141,735.86, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $40,215.70.<h4>Conclusion</h4>There was a significant divergence between bacterial and fungal rim-culture results. Bacterial cultures predicted clinical infection poorly, did not change management, and were expensive. Fungal cultures predicted clinical infection in over 10% of patients, had the potential to change management, and were 40% less expensive than full rim culturing (bacterial and fungal tests).

10.1101/2021.07.30.454526,"A Master Autoantigen-ome Links Alternative Splicing, Female Predilection, and COVID-19 to Autoimmune Diseases","Chronic and debilitating autoimmune sequelae pose a grave concern for the post-COVID-19 pandemic era. Based on our discovery that the glycosaminoglycan dermatan sulfate (DS) displays peculiar affinity to apoptotic cells and autoantigens (autoAgs) and that DS-autoAg complexes cooperatively stimulate autoreactive B1 cell responses, we compiled a database of 751 candidate autoAgs from six human cell types. At least 657 of these have been found to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection based on currently available multi-omic COVID data, and at least 400 are confirmed targets of autoantibodies in a wide array of autoimmune diseases and cancer. The autoantigen-ome is significantly associated with various processes in viral infections, such as translation, protein processing, and vesicle transport. Interestingly, the coding genes of autoAgs predominantly contain multiple exons with many possible alternative splicing variants, short transcripts, and short UTR lengths. These observations and the finding that numerous autoAgs involved in RNA-splicing showed altered expression in viral infections suggest that viruses exploit alternative splicing to reprogram host cell machinery to ensure viral replication and survival. While each cell type gives rise to a unique pool of autoAgs, 39 common autoAgs associated with cell stress and apoptosis were identified from all six cell types, with several being known markers of systemic autoimmune diseases. In particular, the common autoAg UBA1 that catalyzes the first step in ubiquitination is encoded by an X-chromosome escape gene. Given its essential function in apoptotic cell clearance and that X-inactivation escape tends to increase with aging, UBA1 dysfunction can therefore predispose aging women to autoimmune disorders. In summary, we propose a model of how viral infections lead to extensive molecular alterations and host cell death, autoimmune responses facilitated by autoAg-DS complexes, and ultimately autoimmune diseases. Overall, this master autoantigen-ome provides a molecular guide for investigating the myriad of autoimmune sequalae to COVID-19 and clues to the rare but reported adverse effects of the currently available COVID vaccines.","Chronic and debilitating autoimmune sequelae pose a grave concern for the post-COVID-19 pandemic era.

Biological control using environmental microorganisms is considered as an alternative and sustainable strategy. Actinomycetes have the potential to explore biocontrol agents due to their production of diverse metabolites. The isolation and identification of high-efficiency and broad-spectrum antagonistic actinomycetes are the key for the application of biocontrol agents. In the present study, 60 actinomycetes were obtained from the rhizosphere soil of <i>Machilus pingii</i> in the primitive ecological natural reserve of Hainan province, China. Seventeen isolates and their extracts exhibited significant antifungal activity against <i>F. oxysporum</i> TR4. Particularly, strain BITDG-11 with the strongest inhibition ability had a broad-spectrum antifungal activity. The assay of its physiological and biochemical profiles showed that strain BITDG-11 had the ability to produce IAA and siderophores and had a positive response to gelatin liquefaction and nitrate reduction. Enzyme activities of chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase, lipase, and urease were also detected. Average nucleotide identity calculated by comparison with the standard strain genome of <i>Streptomyces albospinus</i> JCM3399 was 86.55% below the novel species threshold, suggesting that the strain could be a novel species. In addition, <i>Streptomyces</i> BITDG-11 obviously reduced the disease index of banana plantlets and promoted plant growth at 45 days post inoculation. The higher and lasting expression levels of defense genes and activities of antioxidant enzymes were induced in the roots of banana. Genome sequencing revealed that the <i>Streptomyces</i> BITDG-11 chromosome contained large numbers of conserved biosynthesis gene clusters encoding terpenes, non-ribosomal peptides, polyketides, siderophores, and ectoines. Fifteen bioactive secondary metabolites were further identified from <i>Streptomyces</i> BITDG-11 extract by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Dibutyl phthalate demonstrating a strong antifungal activity was the major compound with the highest peak area. Hence, <i>Streptomyces</i> sp.

10.1039/d1na00859e,A review on contemporary nanomaterial-based therapeutics for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) with special reference to the Indian scenario.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a predominant chronic metabolic syndrome, resulting in various complications and high mortality associated with diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Approximately 15-30% of diabetic patients suffer from DFUs, which is expected to increase annually. The major challenges in treating DFUs are associated with wound infections, alterations to inflammatory responses, angiogenesis and lack of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Furthermore, the lack of targeted therapy and efficient wound dressings for diabetic wounds often results in extended hospitalization and limb amputations. Hence, it is essential to develop and improve DFU-specific therapies. Nanomaterial-based innovative approaches have tremendous potential for preventing and treating wound infections of bacterial origin. They have greater benefits compared to traditional wound dressing approaches. In this approach, the physiochemical features of nanomaterials allow researchers to employ different methods for diabetic wound healing applications. In this review, the status and prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and amputations due to DFUs in India, the pathophysiology of DFUs and their complications are discussed. Additionally, nanomaterial-based approaches such as the use of nanoemulsions, nanoparticles, nanoliposomes and nanofibers for the treatment of DFUs are studied. Besides, emerging therapeutics such as bioengineered skin substitutes and nanomaterial-based innovative approaches such as antibacterial hyperthermia therapy and gene therapy for the treatment of DFUs are highlighted.

To prevent postoperative CSF leakage, various surgical techniques have been used, including sellar floor reconstruction with artificial bone grafts. However, some authors have recently reported infections associated with artificial bone grafts. Most cases are associated with bacterial infection, and fungal infection is extremely rare. We present the case of a 53-year-old woman with sphenoiditis caused by <i>Aspergillus</i> infection that developed 8 years after TSS and following local radiation therapy for a non-functioning pituitary adenoma. An artificial bone graft prepared from polymethylmethacrylate was used for sellar floor reconstruction. The patient presented to our department with a complaint of bloody nasal discharge. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that a fungal lump had formed around the bone graft, which had broken into two pieces and dropped out into the sphenoid sinus, without tumor recurrence. Histological examination of an endoscopic biopsy specimen led to a diagnosis of aspergillosis. Subsequent complete removal of both the bone graft and fungal lump resulted in a good postoperative outcome. Although fungal infection is an extremely rare complication after TSS using artificial bone grafts, it should be diagnosed as early as possible, and removal of both the fungal lump and the bone graft should be performed in a timely manner after clinical and radiological confirmation.","Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is a major complication during and after transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) for intra- and suprasellar tumors.

We present the case of a 53-year-old woman with sphenoiditis caused by <i>Aspergillus</i> infection that developed 8 years after TSS and following local radiation therapy for a non-functioning pituitary adenoma. An artificial bone graft prepared from polymethylmethacrylate was used for sellar floor reconstruction. The patient presented to our department with a complaint of bloody nasal discharge. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that a fungal lump had formed around the bone graft, which had broken into two pieces and dropped out into the sphenoid sinus, without tumor recurrence. Histological examination of an endoscopic biopsy specimen led to a diagnosis of aspergillosis. Subsequent complete removal of both the bone graft and fungal lump resulted in a good postoperative outcome. Although fungal infection is an extremely rare complication after TSS using artificial bone grafts, it should be diagnosed as early as possible, and removal of both the fungal lump and the bone graft should be performed in a timely manner after clinical and radiological confirmation.",EuropePMC
10.3390/molecules27238453,Identification of Novel Antifungal Skeleton of Hydroxyethyl Naphthalimides with Synergistic Potential for Chemical and Dynamic Treatments.,"The invasion of pathogenic fungi poses nonnegligible threats to the human health and agricultural industry. This work exploited a family of hydroxyethyl naphthalimides as novel antifungal species with synergistic potential of chemical and dynamic treatment to combat the fungal resistance. These prepared naphthalimides showed better antifungal potency than fluconazole towards some tested fungi including <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>, <i>Candida tropicalis</i> and <i>Candida parapsilosis</i> 22019. Especially, thioether benzimidazole derivative <b>7f</b> with excellent anti-<i>Candida tropicalis</i> efficacy (MIC = 4 μg/mL) possessed low cytotoxicity, safe hemolysis level and less susceptibility to induce resistance. Biochemical interactions displayed that <b>7f</b> could form a supramolecular complex with DNA to block DNA replication, and constitute a biosupermolecule with cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) from <i>Candida tropicalis</i> to hinder CPR biological function. Additionally, <b>7f</b> presented strong lipase affinity, which facilitated its permeation into cell membrane. Moreover, <b>7f</b> with dynamic antifungal potency promoted the production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells, which destroyed the antioxidant defence system, led to oxidative stress with lipid peroxidation, loss of glutathione, membrane dysfunction and metabolic inactivation, and eventually caused cell death. The chemical and dynamic antifungal synergistic effect initiated by hydroxyethyl naphthalimides was a reasonable treatment window for prospective development.","The invasion of pathogenic fungi poses nonnegligible threats to the human health and agricultural industry.

Traditional donor hierarchy favours a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor (MSD) over an HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD), followed by alternative donors such as haploidentical donors or unrelated cord blood. However, haploidentical HSCT (hHSCT) may be entailed with significant advantages: besides a potentially increased graft-vs.-leukaemia effect, the immediate availability of a relative as well as the possibility of a second donation for additional cellular therapies may impact on outcome. The key question in hHSCT is how, and how deeply, to deplete donor T-cells. More T cells in the graft confer faster immune reconstitution with consecutively lower infection rates, however, greater numbers of T-cells might be associated with higher rates of graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD). Two different methods for reduction of alloreactivity have been established: <i>in vivo</i> T-cell suppression and <i>ex vivo</i> T-cell depletion (TCD). <i>Ex vivo</i> TCD of the graft uses either positive selection or negative depletion of graft cells before infusion. In contrast, T-cell-repleted grafts consisting of non-manipulated bone marrow or peripheral blood graft<i>s</i> require intense <i>in vivo</i> GvHD prophylaxis. There are two major T-cell replete protocols: one is based on post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy), while the other is based on anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG; Beijing protocol). Published data do not show an unequivocal benefit for one of these three platforms in terms of overall survival, non-relapse mortality or disease recurrence. In this review, we discuss the pros and cons of these three different approaches to hHSCT with an emphasis on the significance of the existing data for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents a potentially curative option for children with high-risk or refractory/relapsed leukaemias.

10.5114/jcb.2020.93543,The role of brachytherapy in the management of brain metastases: a systematic review.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Brain metastases have a highly variable prognosis depending on the primary tumor and associated prognostic factors. Standard of care for patients with these tumors includes craniotomy, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) for patients with brain metastases. Brachytherapy shows great promise as a therapy for brain metastases, but its role has not been sufficiently explored in the current literature.<h4>Material and methods</h4>The PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus databases were searched using a combination of search terms and synonyms for brachytherapy, brain neoplasms, and brain metastases, for articles published between January 1<sup>st</sup>, 1990 and January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2018. Of the 596 articles initially identified, 37 met the inclusion criteria, of which 14 were review articles, while the remaining 23 papers with detailing individual studies were fully analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>Most data focused on <sup>125</sup>I and suggested that it offers rates of local control and overall survival comparable to standard of care modalities such as SRS. However, radiation necrosis and regional recurrence were often high with this isotope. Studies using photon radiosurgery modality of brachytherapy have also been completed, resulting superior regional control as compared to SRS, but worse local control and higher rates of radiation necrosis than <sup>125</sup>I. More recently, studies using the <sup>131</sup>Cs for brachytherapy offered similar local control and survival benefits to <sup>125</sup>I, with low rates of radiation necrosis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>For a variety of reasons including absence of physician expertise in brachytherapy, lack of published data on treatment outcomes, and rates of radiation necrosis, brachytherapy is not presently a part of standard paradigm for brain metastases. However, our review indicates brachytherapy as a modality that offers excellent local control and quality of life, and suggested that its use should be further studied.","<h4>Purpose</h4>Brain metastases have a highly variable prognosis depending on the primary tumor and associated prognostic factors.

Brachytherapy shows great promise as a therapy for brain metastases, but its role has not been sufficiently explored in the current literature.<h4>Material and methods</h4>The PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus databases were searched using a combination of search terms and synonyms for brachytherapy, brain neoplasms, and brain metastases, for articles published between January 1<sup>st</sup>, 1990 and January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2018. Of the 596 articles initially identified, 37 met the inclusion criteria, of which 14 were review articles, while the remaining 23 papers with detailing individual studies were fully analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>Most data focused on <sup>125</sup>I and suggested that it offers rates of local control and overall survival comparable to standard of care modalities such as SRS. However, radiation necrosis and regional recurrence were often high with this isotope. Studies using photon radiosurgery modality of brachytherapy have also been completed, resulting superior regional control as compared to SRS, but worse local control and higher rates of radiation necrosis than <sup>125</sup>I. More recently, studies using the <sup>131</sup>Cs for brachytherapy offered similar local control and survival benefits to <sup>125</sup>I, with low rates of radiation necrosis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>For a variety of reasons including absence of physician expertise in brachytherapy, lack of published data on treatment outcomes, and rates of radiation necrosis, brachytherapy is not presently a part of standard paradigm for brain metastases. However, our review indicates brachytherapy as a modality that offers excellent local control and quality of life, and suggested that its use should be further studied.",EuropePMC
10.2147/ijn.s250960,Formulation and Characterization of Sertaconazole Nitrate Mucoadhesive Liposomes for Vaginal Candidiasis.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The aim of this study is to develop efficient localized therapy of sertaconazole nitrate for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis.<h4>Methods</h4>Sertaconazole nitrate-loaded cationic liposomes were prepared by thin-film hydration method and coated with different concentrations of pectin (0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2%) to develop mucoadhesive liposomes. The formulated mucoadhesive vesicles were characterized in terms of morphology, entrapment efficiency, particle size, zeta value, mucoadhesive properties and drug release. The selected formula was incorporated into a gel base and further characterized by an ex vivo permeation study in comparison with conventional sertaconazole gel. Also, the in vivo study was performed to assess the efficacy of sertaconazole mucoadhesive liposomal gel in treating rats with vaginal candidiasis.<h4>Results</h4>The mucoadhesive liposomes were spherical. Coating liposomes with pectin results in increased entrapment efficiency and particle size compared with uncoated vesicles. On the contrary, zeta values were reduced upon coating liposomes with pectin indicating efficient coating of liposomes with pectin. Mucoadhesive liposomes showed a more prolonged and sustained drug release compared with uncoated liposomes. Ex vivo study results showed that mucoadhesive liposomal gel increased sertaconazole tissue retention and reduced drug tissue penetration. In the invivo study, the mucoadhesive liposomal gel showed a significant reduction in the microbial count with a subsequent reduction in inflammatory responses with the lowest histopathological change compared with conventional gel.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The study confirmed the potentiality of employing mucoadhesive liposomes as a successful carrier for the vaginal delivery of antifungal drugs.","<h4>Purpose</h4>The aim of this study is to develop efficient localized therapy of sertaconazole nitrate for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis.<h4>Methods</h4>Sertaconazole nitrate-loaded cationic liposomes were prepared by thin-film hydration method and coated with different concentrations of pectin (0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2%) to develop mucoadhesive liposomes.

Mammalian cells, including cells of the innate immune system elaborate chitinases, including chitotriosidase (Chit1), which may play a role in the anti-fungal immune response. In the current study, using knockout mice, we determined the role of Chit1 against systemic candidiasis. Chit1-deficient mice showed significant decrease in kidney fungal burden compared to mice expressing the functional enzyme. Using <i>in vitro</i> anti-candidal neutrophil functional assays, the introduction of the Chit1:chitin digestion end-product, chitobiose (N-acetyl-D-glucosamine dimer, GlcNAc2), decreased fungal-induced neutrophil swarming and Candida killing <i>in vitro</i>. Also, a role for the lectin-like binding site on the neutrophil integrin CR3 (Mac-1, CD11b/CD18) was found through physiological competitive interference by chitobiose. Furthermore, chitobiose treatment of wild type mice during systemic candidiasis resulted in the significant increase in fungal burden in the kidney. These data suggest a counterproductive role of Chit1 in mounting an efficient anti-fungal defense against systemic candidiasis.","Mammalian cells do not produce chitin, an insoluble polymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), although chitin is a structural component of the cell wall of pathogenic microorganisms such as Candida albicans.

Therefore, the development of new antimicrobial therapeutic strategies requires immediate attention to avoid the ten million deaths predicted to occur by 2050 as a result of MDR bacteria. The repurposing of drugs as therapeutic alternatives for infections has recently gained renewed interest. As drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, information about their pharmacological characteristics in preclinical and clinical trials is available. Therefore, the time and economic costs required to evaluate these drugs for other therapeutic applications, such as the treatment of bacterial and fungal infections, are mitigated. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the scientific evidence on potential non-antimicrobial drugs targeting bacteria and fungi. In particular, we aim to: (i) list the approved drugs identified in drug screens as potential alternative treatments for infections caused by MDR pathogens; (ii) review their mechanisms of action against bacteria and fungi; and (iii) summarize the outcome of preclinical and clinical trials investigating approved drugs that target these pathogens.","Multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens pose a well-recognized global health threat that demands effective solutions; the situation is deemed a global priority by the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Releases of Metarhizium anisopliae--exposed Ae. aegypti males to disseminate conidia among female mosquitoes by mating represents a promising biological control approach against this important vector. A better understanding of fungus virulence and impact on reproductive parameters of Ae. aegypti, is need before testing auto-dissemination strategies.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>Mortality, mating competitiveness, sperm production, and the capacity to auto-disseminate the fungus to females up to the 5 th copulation, were compared between Aedes aegypti males exposed to 5.96 x 10(7) conidia per cm2 of M. anisopliae and uninfected males. Half (50%) of fungus-exposed males (FEMs) died within the first 4 days post-exposure (PE). FEMs required 34% more time to successively copulate with 5 females (165 ± 3 minutes) than uninfected males (109 ± 3 minutes). Additionally, fungus infection reduced the sperm production by 87% at 5 days PE. Some beneficial impacts were observed, FEMs were able to successfully compete with uninfected males in cages, inseminating an equivalent number of females (about 25%). Under semi-field conditions, the ability of FEMs to search for and inseminate females was also equivalent to uninfected males (both inseminating about 40% females); but for the remaining females that were not inseminated, evidence of tarsal contact (transfer of fluorescent dust) was significantly greater in FEMs compared to controls. The estimated conidia load of a female exposed on the 5th copulation was 5,200 mL(-1) which was sufficient to cause mortality.<h4>Conclusion/significance</h4>Our study is the first to demonstrate auto-dissemination of M. anisopliae through transfer of fungus from males to female Ae. aegypti during mating under semi-field conditions. Our results suggest that auto-dissemination studies using releases of FEMs inside households could successfully infect wild Ae. aegypti females, providing another viable biological control tool for this important the dengue vector.","<h4>Background</h4>Dengue is the most prevalent arboviral disease transmitted by Aedes aegypti worldwide, whose chemical control is difficult, expensive, and of inconsistent efficacy.

10.1002/14651858.cd009012.pub3,Early versus delayed antiretroviral treatment in HIV-positive people with cryptococcal meningitis.,"<h4>Background</h4>There remains uncertainty about the optimum timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation in HIV-positive people with cryptococcal meningitis. This uncertainty is the result of conflicting data on the mortality risk and occurrence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) when ART is initiated less than four weeks after cryptococcal meningitis treatment is commenced.<h4>Objectives</h4>To compare the outcomes of early initiation of ART (less than four weeks after starting antifungal treatment) versus delayed initiation of ART (four weeks or more after starting antifungal treatment) in HIV-positive people with concurrent cryptococcal meningitis.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for trials published between 1 January 1980 and 7 August 2017. We additionally searched international trial registries, including ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and conference abstracts from the International AIDS Society (IAS) and the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) for ongoing or unpublished studies between 2015 and 2017. We reviewed reference lists of included studies to identify additional studies.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared early versus delayed ART initiation in HIV-positive people with cryptococcal meningitis. Children, adults, and adolescents from any setting were eligible for inclusion.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and extracted data. We presented dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We presented time-to-death data as hazard ratios with 95% CIs. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.<h4>Main results</h4>Four trials including 294 adult participants met the inclusion criteria of this review. Participants were predominantly from low- and middle-income countries. Two trials treated cryptococcal meningitis with amphotericin B and fluconazole; a third trial used fluconazole monotherapy; and the fourth trial did not specify the antifungal used.Early ART initiation may increase all-cause mortality compared to delayed ART initiation (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.97; 294 participants, 4 trials; low-certainty evidence). Early ART initiation may reduce relapse of cryptococcal meningitis compared to delayed ART initiation (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.04; 205 participants, 2 trials, low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether early ART initiation increases or reduces cryptococcal IRIS events compared to delayed ART initiation (RR 3.56, 95% CI 0.51 to 25.02; 205 participants, 2 trials; I<sup>2</sup> = 54%; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if early ART initiation increases or reduces virological suppression at six months compared to delayed ART initiation (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.22; 205 participants, 2 trials; I<sup>2</sup> statistic = 0%; very low-certainty evidence).We were unable to pool results related to rate of fungal clearance for the two trials that reported this outcome; individual trial results indicated that there was no difference in cerebrospinal fluid fungal clearance between trial arms. Similarly, we were unable to pool results on adverse events for the trials reporting on this outcome; individual trial results indicated no difference in the occurrence of grade 3 to 5 adverse events between trial arms.Three of the four included trials had an overall low or unclear risk of bias related to the primary outcome of all-cause mortality. However, we assessed one trial as at high risk of bias due to selective outcome reporting and other bias. This, in addition to the few clinical events and imprecision of effect estimates, led to downgrading of the evidence to low or very low certainty.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>The results of this review are relevant to HIV-positive adults with cryptococcal meningitis in low- and middle-income countries. These data suggest a higher risk of mortality among people who initiate ART within four weeks of cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis. However, it is unclear if this higher mortality risk is related to cryptococcal meningitis-IRIS.","<h4>Background</h4>There remains uncertainty about the optimum timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation in HIV-positive people with cryptococcal meningitis.

CST is notorious for its bad prognosis, with high mortality and morbidity rates described in literature. However, these rates are based on old series. We question whether the prognosis of CST is currently still as devastating. The primary purpose of this study is to assess the mortality and morbidity of CST.<h4>Methods</h4>Using the databases of all relevant specialties in our tertiary referral hospital, we collected all the patients treated for CST in the period 2005-2017. In addition, a PubMed search, using the mesh term 'cavernous sinus thrombosis', was performed.<h4>Results</h4>We found 12 patients with CST in the study period. Of the 12 patients, 11 survived and 9 recovered without any permanent deficits. Seven patients were treated with anticoagulation, and in none of the patients we saw hemorrhagic complications. In literature, older articles describe higher mortality rates (14-80%), but more recent articles report mortality and morbidity rates similar to our results.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The prognosis of CST nowadays is more favorable than previously described. Anticoagulation seems to be a safe addition to antibiotic and surgical treatment, at least in patients without central nervous system infection.","<h4>Purpose</h4>Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is a rare complication of infections in the head and neck area.

In this study, we developed allotetraploid finger lime hybrids and cybrids by utilizing somatic cell fusion techniques to fuse diploid 'OLL8' sweet orange or 'Page' tangelo callus-derived protoplasts with finger lime (FL) mesophyll-derived protoplasts. Six somatic fusions were regenerated from the 'OLL8' + FL fusion, while three putative cybrids were regenerated from the 'Page' + FL fusion. Ploidy levels and nuclear-expressed sequence tag derived simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers confirmed the somatic hybrid production, and mitochondrial DNA primer sets confirmed the cybrid nature. Several trees produced by the somatic fusion remained HLB negative even after 6 years of growth in an HLB-endemic environment. Pathogenesis related (PR) and other genes that are often upregulated in HLB-tolerant trees were also upregulated in our somatic fusions. These newly developed somatic fusions and cybrids could potentially be used as breeding parents to develop the next generation of improved HLB-tolerant rootstocks and scions.","The Australian finger lime is a unique citrus species that has gained importance due to its unique fruit characteristics and perceived tolerance to Huanglongbing (HLB), an often-fatal disease of citrus trees.

10.1186/s13047-019-0332-3,The use of urea for the treatment of onychomycosis: a systematic review.,"<h4>Background</h4>Onychomycosis, a fungal infection affecting the nail plate, is a common condition often requiring prolonged treatment regimens, with low success rates. Urea is one treatment option, which is thought to improve the efficacy of topical and oral antifungal agents. Despite a theoretical basis for the use of urea for the treatment of onychomycosis, the evidence-base for this treatment has not been systematically reviewed.<h4>Aim</h4>The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review to determine the efficacy and safety of urea as a monotherapy and as adjunct therapy, compared to other treatment regimens for onychomycosis.<h4>Method</h4>A systematic literature search of ten electronic databases was conducted. Only studies that used microscopy and culture or other validated laboratory-based testing method to confirm the presence of a fungal infection before treatment were included. The outcome measures assessed were efficacy (defined in terms of mycological, clinical and complete cure) and safety (defined as self-reported adverse events).<h4>Results</h4>The systematic search yielded 560 unique studies for review. Of these, only six were eligible for inclusion. All studies were observed to have methodological concerns, most studies consisted of small sample sizes and were difficult to compare given heterogeneity in outcome measures and follow-up time. Despite this, a trend was observed to suggest that urea, when added to topical or oral antifungal treatment regimens, improved efficacy of the treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This review suggests that topical urea, as an adjunct to topical and oral antifungal treatment regimens, may improve the efficacy of treatment.

10.1038/s41598-018-37108-2,A new application of Trichoderma asperellum as an anopheline larvicide for eco friendly management in medical science.,"Microfungal applications are increasing daily in the medical science. Several species of Trichoderma are widely used in agricultural fields as biological control and plant growth promoting agents. The application of Trichoderma asperellum as an entomopathogenic fungus against the Anopheles mosquito, a vector of malaria, is a novel control approach. Controlling malaria with eco-friendly management practices is an urgent need. We isolated three T. asperellum from different natural sources using serial dilution and mosquito baiting techniques. The fungi were identified on the basis of phenotypical and molecular characteristics. The fungi were grown in different natural media to examine spore production ability and the fungal spore suspensions were applied to the anopheline larvae to determine their larvicidal activity in vitro. We investigated the efficacy of crude ME (methanolic extract) and different methanolic fractions (MFs) of the fungal extracts against anopheline larvae.

Several species of Trichoderma are widely used in agricultural fields as biological control and plant growth promoting agents. The application of Trichoderma asperellum as an entomopathogenic fungus against the Anopheles mosquito, a vector of malaria, is a novel control approach. Controlling malaria with eco-friendly management practices is an urgent need. We isolated three T. asperellum from different natural sources using serial dilution and mosquito baiting techniques. The fungi were identified on the basis of phenotypical and molecular characteristics. The fungi were grown in different natural media to examine spore production ability and the fungal spore suspensions were applied to the anopheline larvae to determine their larvicidal activity in vitro. We investigated the efficacy of crude ME (methanolic extract) and different methanolic fractions (MFs) of the fungal extracts against anopheline larvae.

Indirect recognition of a pathogen effector by the dicotyledonous Arabidopsis thaliana coiled-coil domain containing NLR (CNL) ZAR1 induces the formation of a large hetero-oligomeric protein complex, termed the ZAR1 resistosome, which functions as a calcium channel required for ZAR1-mediated immunity<sup>2-4</sup>. Whether the resistosome and channel activities are conserved among plant CNLs remains unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the wheat CNL Sr35<sup>5</sup> in complex with the effector AvrSr35<sup>6</sup> of the wheat stem rust pathogen. Direct effector binding to the leucine-rich repeats of Sr35 results in the formation of a pentameric Sr35-AvrSr35 complex, which we term the Sr35 resistosome. Wheat Sr35 and Arabidopsis ZAR1 resistosomes bear striking structural similarities, including an arginine cluster in the leucine-rich repeats domain not previously recognized as conserved, which co-occurs and forms intramolecular interactions with the 'EDVID' motif in the coiled-coil domain. Electrophysiological measurements show that the Sr35 resistosome exhibits non-selective cation channel activity. These structural insights allowed us to generate new variants of closely related wheat and barley orphan NLRs that recognize AvrSr35. Our data support the evolutionary conservation of CNL resistosomes in plants and demonstrate proof of principle for structure-based engineering of NLRs for crop improvement.","Plant intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) detect pathogen effectors to trigger immune responses<sup>1</sup>.

10.3390/insects12090805,"Frequent Drivers, Occasional Passengers: Signals of Symbiont-Driven Seasonal Adaptation and Hitchhiking in the Pea Aphid, <i>Acyrthosiphon pisum</i>.","Insects harbor a variety of maternally inherited bacterial symbionts. As such, variation in symbiont presence/absence, in the combinations of harbored symbionts, and in the genotypes of harbored symbiont species provide heritable genetic variation of potential use in the insects' adaptive repertoires. Understanding the natural importance of symbionts is challenging but studying their dynamics over time can help to elucidate the potential for such symbiont-driven insect adaptation. Toward this end, we studied the seasonal dynamics of six maternally transferred bacterial symbiont species in the multivoltine pea aphid (<i>Acyrthosiphon pisum</i>). Our sampling focused on six alfalfa fields in southeastern Pennsylvania, and spanned 14 timepoints within the 2012 growing season, in addition to two overwintering periods. To test and generate hypotheses on the natural relevance of these non-essential symbionts, we examined whether symbiont dynamics correlated with any of ten measured environmental variables from the 2012 growing season, including some of known importance in the lab. We found that five symbionts changed prevalence across one or both overwintering periods, and that the same five species underwent such frequency shifts across the 2012 growing season. Intriguingly, the frequencies of these dynamic symbionts showed robust correlations with a subset of our measured environmental variables. Several of these trends supported the natural relevance of lab-discovered symbiont roles, including anti-pathogen defense. For a seventh symbiont-<i>Hamiltonella defensa</i>-studied previously across the same study periods, we tested whether a reported correlation between prevalence and temperature stemmed not from thermally varying host-level fitness effects, but from selection on co-infecting symbionts or on aphid-encoded alleles associated with this bacterium. In general, such ""hitchhiking"" effects were not evident during times with strongly correlated <i>Hamiltonella</i> and temperature shifts. However, we did identify at least one time period in which <i>Hamiltonella</i> spread was likely driven by selection on a co-infecting symbiont-<i>Rickettsiella viridis</i>. Recognizing the broader potential for such hitchhiking, we explored selection on co-infecting symbionts as a possible driver behind the dynamics of the remaining six species. Out of twelve examined instances of symbiont dynamics unfolding across 2-week periods or overwintering spans, we found eight in which the focal symbiont underwent parallel frequency shifts under single infection and one or more co-infection contexts. This supported the idea that phenotypic variation created by the presence/absence of individual symbionts is a direct target for selection, and that symbiont effects can be robust under co-habitation with other symbionts. Contrastingly, in two cases, we found that selection may target phenotypes emerging from symbiont co-infections, with specific species combinations driving overall trends for the focal dynamic symbionts, without correlated change under single infection. Finally, in three cases-including the one described above for <i>Hamiltonella</i>-our data suggested that incidental co-infection with a (dis)favored symbiont could lead to large frequency shifts for ""passenger"" symbionts, conferring no apparent cost or benefit. Such hitchhiking has rarely been studied in heritable symbiont systems. We propose that it is more common than appreciated, given the widespread nature of maternally inherited bacteria, and the frequency of multi-species symbiotic communities across insects.","Insects harbor a variety of maternally inherited bacterial symbionts.

Although there have been several studies on the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans and surrogate animals, there is little information on the interactions of these viruses with their natural bat hosts. We detected a coronavirus in the intestines of 53/174 hibernating little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), as well as in the lungs of some of these individuals. Interestingly, the presence of the virus was not accompanied by overt inflammation. Viral RNA amplified from little brown bats in this study appeared to be from two distinct clades. The sequences in clade 1 were very similar to the archived sequence derived from little brown bats and the sequences from clade 2 were more closely related to the archived sequence from big brown bats. This suggests that two closely related coronaviruses may circulate in little brown bats. Sequence variation among coronavirus detected from individual bats suggested that infection occurred prior to hibernation, and that the virus persisted for up to 4 months of hibernation in the laboratory. Based on the sequence of its genome, the coronavirus was placed in the Alphacoronavirus genus, along with some human coronaviruses, bat viruses and the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus. The detection and identification of an apparently persistent coronavirus in a local bat species creates opportunities to understand the dynamics of coronavirus circulation in bat populations.","Bats are important reservoir hosts for emerging viruses, including coronaviruses that cause diseases in people.

We previously demonstrated that the injured leech nerve cord is able to mount an immune response promoting the regenerative processes. Indeed neurons and microglia express sensing receptors like Hm-TLR1, a leech TLR ortholog, associated with chemokine release in response to a septic challenge or lesion. To gain insights into the TLR signaling pathways involved during these neuroimmune responses, members of the MyD88 family were investigated. In the present study, we report the characterization of Hm-MyD88 and Hm-SARM. The expression of their encoding gene was strongly regulated in leech CNS not only upon immune challenge but also during CNS repair, suggesting their involvement in both processes. This work also showed for the first time that differentiated neurons of the CNS could respond to LPS through a MyD88-dependent signalling pathway, while in mammals, studies describing the direct effect of LPS on neurons and the outcomes of such treatment are scarce and controversial. In the present study, we established that this PAMP induced the relocalization of Hm-MyD88 in isolated neurons.","Unlike mammals, the CNS of the medicinal leech can regenerate damaged neurites, thus restoring neural functions after lesion.

At its peak range expansion in 1915 it encompassed an area of 150,000 km2 after which populations declined. By the 1960s, its distribution had receded to relic populations on outer Cape Cod, MA, and islands in Casco Bay, ME. In 1989 browntail moth resurged in Maine, with periodic, moderate outbreaks before a dramatic increase of the population occurred in 2016. We examined the pattern of annual defoliation by browntail moth since its resurgence in the 1990s as well as variation in populations throughout infested areas in Maine during three years of the recent outbreak, 2016-2018, relative to differences in weather, parasitism and habitat characteristics. Levels of defoliation over 24 yr were predicted by the preceding spring precipitation (-, negative effect) and the year's previous late summer and early fall temperatures (+, positive effect) when first to third instar larvae feed and then construct winter hibernacula. Late summer temperatures predicted the abundance of hibernacula across outbreak areas (+). Early spring temperatures (+) and early and late spring precipitation (-) predicted early summer larval and pupal nest abundance. Warmer fall temperatures result in more mature populations coming out of winter hibernacula in the spring, whereas spring precipitation drives epizootic outbreaks of Entomophaga aulicae (Reichardt in Bail) Humber (Entomophthorales: Entomophthoraceae). with parasitoids playing a lesser role.

Consequently, in recent years studies on plant relationships with multiple stresses have aroused increasing interest. Here, the impact of inoculation with fungal pathogens with different lifestyles on Arabidopsis plants response to the following infestation with the invasive crop pest Eurydema oleracea was investigated. In particular, as fungal pathogens the necrotroph Botrytis cinerea and the biotroph Golovinomyces orontii were used. Plants exposed to B. cinerea, but not to G. orontii, showed reduced herbivore feeding damage. This difference was associated to different hormonal pathways triggered by the pathogens: G. orontii only induced the salicylate-mediated pathway, while B. cinerea stimulated also the jasmonate-dependent signalling, which persisted for a long time providing a long-term defence to further herbivore attack. In particular, the lower susceptibility of B. cinerea-infected Arabidopsis plants to E. oleracea was related to the stimulation of the JA-induced pathway on the production of plant volatile compounds, since treatment with VOCs emitted by B. cinerea inoculated plants inhibited both insect plant choice and feeding damage. These results indicate that necrotrophic plant pathogenic fungi modulate host volatile emission, thus affecting plant response to subsequent insect, thereby increasing the knowledge on tripartite plant-microbe-insect interactions in nature.","In ecosystems, plants are continuously challenged by combined stress conditions more than by a single biotic or abiotic factor. Consequently, in recent years studies on plant relationships with multiple stresses have aroused increasing interest. Here, the impact of inoculation with fungal pathogens with different lifestyles on Arabidopsis plants response to the following infestation with the invasive crop pest Eurydema oleracea was investigated. In particular, as fungal pathogens the necrotroph Botrytis cinerea and the biotroph Golovinomyces orontii were used. Plants exposed to B. cinerea, but not to G. orontii, showed reduced herbivore feeding damage.

10.1093/plcell/koab206,"Medicago SPX1 and SPX3 regulate phosphate homeostasis, mycorrhizal colonization, and arbuscule degradation.","To acquire sufficient mineral nutrients such as phosphate (Pi) from the soil, most plants engage in symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Attracted by plant-secreted strigolactones (SLs), the fungi colonize the roots and form highly branched hyphal structures called arbuscules inside inner cortex cells. The host plant must control the different steps of this interaction to maintain its symbiotic nature. However, how plants sense the amount of Pi obtained from the fungus, and how this determines the arbuscule lifespan, are far from understood. Here, we show that Medicago truncatula SPX-domain containing proteins SPX1 and SPX3 regulate root Pi starvation responses, in part by interacting with PHOSPHATE RESPONSE REGULATOR2, as well as fungal colonization and arbuscule degradation. SPX1 and SPX3 are induced upon Pi starvation but become more restricted to arbuscule-containing cells upon the establishment of symbiosis. This induction in arbuscule-containing cells is associated with the presence of cis-regulatory AW-boxes and transcriptional regulation by the WRINKLED1-like transcription factor WRI5a. Under Pi-limiting conditions, SPX1 and SPX3 facilitate the expression of the SL biosynthesis gene DWARF27, which could help explain the increased fungal branching in response to root exudates. Later, in arbuscule-containing cells, SPX1 and SPX3 redundantly control arbuscule degradation. Thus, SPX proteins play important roles as phosphate sensors to maintain a beneficial AM symbiosis.","To acquire sufficient mineral nutrients such as phosphate (Pi) from the soil, most plants engage in symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi.

Chemical control is widely used to suppress these pests but it reduces environmental quality. Biological control of insect pests is an alternative way to reduce the use of chemical insecticides. In this context, two entomopathogenic fungi, <i>Metarhizium</i> brunneum strain F52 and <i>Paranosema locustae</i> were evaluated as control agents for the pest migratory grasshopper <i>Melanoplus sanguinipes</i> under laboratory and greenhouse conditions. Third-instar grasshoppers, reared in the laboratory, were exposed up to fourteen days to wheat bran treated with different concentrations of each of the fungi alone or the two pathogens combined. In the greenhouse, nymphs were placed individually in cages where they were able to increase their body temperatures by basking in the sun in an attempt to inhibit the fungal infection, and treated with each pathogen alone or in combination. Mortality was recorded daily and presence of fungal outgrowth in cadavers was confirmed by recording fungal mycosis for two weeks' post-treatment (PT). For combination treatment, the nature of the pathogen interaction (synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects) was also determined. In laboratory conditions, all treatments except P. locustae alone resulted in grasshopper mortality. The application of the pathogen combinations caused 75% and 77%, mortality for lower and higher concentrations, respectively than each of the pathogens alone. We infer a synergistic effect occurred between the two agents. In greenhouse conditions, the highest mortalities were recorded in combination fungal treatments with a <i>M. brunneum</i> dose (60% mortality) and with a combination of the two pathogens in which <i>M. brunneum</i> was applied at high rate (50%) two weeks after application. This latter combination also exhibited a synergistic effect. Exposure to the <i>P. locustae</i> treatment did not lead to mortality until day 14 PT. We infer that these pathogens are promising for developing a biopesticide formulation for rangeland pest grasshopper management.","Grasshopper outbreaks cause significant damage to crops and grasslands in US.

To investigate the effects of the selective pressures of host plants on the virulence of Foc, a low virulence isolate, foc-3b, was successively inoculated on resistant and susceptible cucumber cultivars for five generations. The virulence of the original isolate diverged; virulence was significantly strengthened after serial passage on the resistant cultivar and weakened on the susceptible plants (p ˂ .05). The expression of four virulence-related genes of F. oxysporum, G-protein α subunit gene fga1, sucrose nonfermenting 1 gene snf1, F-box protein gene frp1, and Class V chitin synthase gene chsV, was quantified using real-time PCR. All genes were significantly upregulated after serial passage on the resistant cultivar, compared to the original strain, and the expression of snf1 was downregulated in strains re-isolated from the susceptible plants (p ˂ .05). A significant positive correlation was found between the expression levels of gene snf1, frp1, and chsV and disease severity of cucumber Fusarium wilt, suggesting these genes may impact virulence differentiation. This study will improve the management of cucumber Fusarium wilt and provide insight into the mechanisms underlying virulence of F. oxysporum.","Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum (Foc) is the causal pathogen of cucumber Fusarium wilt resulting in losses to cucumber production.

10.1002/14651858.cd005647.pub3,Treatment for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Cryptococcal meningitis is a severe fungal infection that occurs primarily in the setting of advanced immunodeficiency and remains a major cause of HIV-related deaths worldwide. The best induction therapy to reduce mortality from HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis is unclear, particularly in resource-limited settings where management of drug-related toxicities associated with more potent antifungal drugs is a challenge.<h4>Objectives</h4>To evaluate the best induction therapy to reduce mortality from HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis; to compare side effect profiles of different therapies.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), LILACS (BIREME), African Index Medicus, and Index Medicus for the South-East Asia Region (IMSEAR) from 1 January 1980 to 9 July 2018. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the ISRCTN registry; and abstracts of select conferences published between 1 July 2014 and 9 July 2018.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomized controlled trials that compared antifungal induction therapies used for the first episode of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. Comparisons could include different individual or combination therapies, or the same antifungal therapies with differing durations of induction (less than two weeks or two or more weeks, the latter being the current standard of care). We included data regardless of age, geographical region, or drug dosage. We specified no language restriction.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts identified by the search strategy. We obtained the full texts of potentially eligible studies to assess eligibility and extracted data using standardized forms. The main outcomes included mortality at 2 weeks, 10 weeks, and 6 months; mean rate of cerebrospinal fluid fungal clearance in the first two weeks of treatment; and Division of AIDS (DAIDS) grade three or four laboratory events. Using random-effects models we determined pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. For the direct comparison of 10-week mortality, we assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We performed a network meta-analysis using multivariate meta-regression. We modelled treatment differences (RR and 95% CI) and determined treatment rankings for two-week and 10-week mortality outcomes using surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). We assessed transitivity by comparing distribution of effect modifiers between studies, local inconsistency through a node-splitting approach, and global inconsistency using design-by-treatment interaction modelling. For the network meta-analysis, we applied a modified GRADE approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence for 10-week mortality.<h4>Main results</h4>We included 13 eligible studies that enrolled 2426 participants and compared 21 interventions. All studies were carried out in adults, and all but two studies were conducted in resource-limited settings, including 11 of 12 studies with 10-week mortality data.In the direct pairwise comparisons evaluating 10-week mortality, one study from four sub-Saharan African countries contributed data to several key comparisons. At 10 weeks these data showed that those on the regimen of one-week amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmBd) and flucytosine (5FC) followed by fluconazole (FLU) on days 8 to 14 had lower mortality when compared to (i) two weeks of AmBd and 5FC (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.93; 228 participants, 1 study), (ii) two weeks of AmBd and FLU (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.86; 227 participants, 1 study), (iii) one week of AmBd with two weeks of FLU (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.72; 224 participants, 1 study), and (iv) two weeks of 5FC and FLU (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.99; 338 participants, 1 study). The evidence for each of these comparisons was of moderate certainty. For other outcomes, this shortened one-week AmBd and 5FC regimen had similar fungal clearance (MD 0.05 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL/day, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.12; 186 participants, 1 study) as well as lower risk of grade three or four anaemia (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.60; 228 participants, 1 study) compared to the two-week regimen of AmBd and 5FC.For 10-week mortality, the comparison of two weeks of 5FC and FLU with two weeks of AmBd and 5FC (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.23; 340 participants, 1 study) or two weeks of AmBd and FLU (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.13; 339 participants, 1 study) did not show a difference in mortality, with moderate-certainty evidence for both comparisons.When two weeks of combination AmBd and 5FC was compared with AmBd alone, pooled data showed lower mortality at 10 weeks (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.95; 231 participants, 2 studies, moderate-certainty evidence).When two weeks of AmBd and FLU was compared to AmBd alone, there was no difference in 10-week mortality in pooled data (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.62; 371 participants, 3 studies, low-certainty evidence).One week of AmBd and 5FC followed by FLU on days 8 to 14 was the best induction therapy regimen after comparison with 11 other regimens for 10-week mortality in the network meta-analysis, with an overall SUCRA ranking of 88%.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>In resource-limited settings, one-week AmBd- and 5FC-based therapy is probably superior to other regimens for treatment of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. An all-oral regimen of two weeks 5FC and FLU may be an alternative in settings where AmBd is unavailable or intravenous therapy cannot be safely administered. We found no mortality benefit of combination two weeks AmBd and FLU compared to AmBd alone. Given the absence of data from studies in children, and limited data from high-income countries, our findings provide limited guidance for treatment in these patients and settings.","<h4>Background</h4>Cryptococcal meningitis is a severe fungal infection that occurs primarily in the setting of advanced immunodeficiency and remains a major cause of HIV-related deaths worldwide.

The modeled dose to the lung (mDTL) was collected downstream of the Alberta throat model using either a filter or a next generation impactor (NGI). Idealized breathing patterns from COPD patient groups - moderate and very severe COPD - were applied. Theoretical lung deposition patterns were assessed by an individual path model.<h4>Results and conclusion</h4>For the Respimat the mDTL was found to be 59% (SD 5%) for the moderate COPD breathing pattern and 67% (SD 5%) for very severe COPD breathing pattern. The percentages refer to nominal dose (ND) in vitro. This is in the range of 44%-63% in vivo in COPD patients who display large individual variability. Breezhaler showed a mDTL of 43% (SD 2%) for moderate disease simulation and 51% (SD 2%) for very severe simulation. The corresponding results for Genuair are mDTL of 32% (SD 2%) for moderate and 42% (SD 1%) for very severe disease. Ellipta vilanterol particles showed a mDTL of 49% (SD 3%) for moderate and 55% (SD 2%) for very severe disease simulation, and Ellipta fluticasone particles showed a mDTL of 33% (SD 3%) and 41% (SD 2%), respectively for the two breathing patterns. Based on the throat output and average flows of the different inhalers, CFD simulations were performed. Laminar and turbulent steady flow calculations indicated that deposition occurs mainly in the small airways. In summary, Respimat showed the lowest amount of particles depositing in the mouth-throat model and the highest amount reaching all regions of the simulation lung model.","<h4>Background</h4>Combining in vitro mouth-throat deposition measurements, cascade impactor data and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, four different inhalers were compared which are indicated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>The Respimat inhaler, the Breezhaler, the Genuair, and the Ellipta were coupled to the idealized Alberta throat model.

10.1007/s00709-016-0945-3,Plant ER geometry and dynamics: biophysical and cytoskeletal control during growth and biotic response.,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an intricate and dynamic network of membrane tubules and cisternae. In plant cells, the ER 'web' pervades the cortex and endoplasm and is continuous with adjacent cells as it passes through plasmodesmata. It is therefore the largest membranous organelle in plant cells. It performs essential functions including protein and lipid synthesis, and its morphology and movement are linked to cellular function. An emerging trend is that organelles can no longer be seen as discrete membrane-bound compartments, since they can physically interact and 'communicate' with one another. The ER may form a connecting central role in this process. This review tackles our current understanding and quantification of ER dynamics and how these change under a variety of biotic and developmental cues.","The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an intricate and dynamic network of membrane tubules and cisternae.

This review tackles our current understanding and quantification of ER dynamics and how these change under a variety of biotic and developmental cues.",EuropePMC
10.1186/s13020-021-00565-5,Qingwei San treats oral ulcer subjected to stomach heat syndrome in db/db mice by targeting TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway.,"<h4>Background</h4>Qingwei San (QWS), one of classic Chinese Medicine prescripts, has been widely used to treat stomach heat syndrome which manifests oral ulcer (OU), periodontitis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding for seven hundred years. However, the therapeutic effects of QWS on diabetic OU subjected to stomach heat syndrome are still ambiguous. In the study, we investigated the pharmacological mechanisms.<h4>Methods</h4>The main components of QWS aqueous extract were analyzed by LC-MS, and potential pathways of QWS targeting OU were predicted by network pharmacology. The db/db mice were administered with the decoction of dried Zingiber officinale Rosc. rhizome combined with NaOH cauterization to establish the model of diabetic OU subjected to stomach heat syndrome. Subsequently, the model mice were treated with QWS, and OU wound healing status were recorded. The pathological changes of gastric tissue and oral mucosa were evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin staining, and the morphology of collagen fibers in oral mucosa was assessed by Masson staining. The levels of thromboxane B<sub>2</sub> (TXB<sub>2</sub>), 6-Keto-prostaglandin F1α (6-keto-PGF1α), interleukin-1 β (IL-1β), IL-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), β-endorphin (β-EP) and 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were determined by ELISA assay. The protein expressions of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), inhibitor of NF-κB alpha (IκΒα), p-IκΒα and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) p65 were measured by Western Blotting.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 183 compounds in QWS were identified by LC-MS, and identified 79 bioactive compounds corresponded to 269 targets and 59 pathways. QWS high-dose treatment significantly reduced the level of TXB<sub>2</sub> and the ratio of TXB<sub>2</sub>/6-keto-PGF1α. Meanwhile, it improved mucosal pathological morphology, and reduced the area of OU and local edema. Simultaneously, the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-2 and 5-HT, and the expressions of TLR4, TRAF6, MyD88, p-IκΒα and NF-κB p65 were decreased.<h4>Conclusion</h4>QWS treatment facilitates the healing of OU, ameliorates pathological morphologies of gastric and oral mucosa and decreases the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in db/db mice subjected to stomach heat syndrome, whose mechanism may be associated with the inhibition of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway to exert anti-inflammatory effects.","<h4>Background</h4>Qingwei San (QWS), one of classic Chinese Medicine prescripts, has been widely used to treat stomach heat syndrome which manifests oral ulcer (OU), periodontitis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding for seven hundred years.

10.1186/s13326-016-0085-x,DermO; an ontology for the description of dermatologic disease.,"<h4>Background</h4>There have been repeated initiatives to produce standard nosologies and terminologies for cutaneous disease, some dedicated to the domain and some part of bigger terminologies such as ICD-10. Recently, formally structured terminologies, ontologies, have been widely developed in many areas of biomedical research. Primarily, these address the aim of providing comprehensive working terminologies for domains of knowledge, but because of the knowledge contained in the relationships between terms they can also be used computationally for many purposes.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed an ontology of cutaneous disease, constructed manually by domain experts. With more than 3000 terms, DermO represents the most comprehensive formal dermatological disease terminology available. The disease entities are categorized in 20 upper level terms, which use a variety of features such as anatomical location, heritability, affected cell or tissue type, or etiology, as the features for classification, in line with professional practice and nosology in dermatology. Available in OBO flatfile and OWL 2 formats, it is integrated semantically with other ontologies and terminologies describing diseases and phenotypes. We demonstrate the application of DermO to text mining the biomedical literature and in the creation of a network describing the phenotypic relationships between cutaneous diseases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DermO is an ontology with broad coverage of the domain of dermatologic disease and we demonstrate here its utility for text mining and investigation of phenotypic relationships between dermatologic disorders. We envision that in the future it may be applied to the creation and mining of electronic health records, clinical training and basic research, as it supports automated inference and reasoning, and for the broader integration of skin disease information with that from other domains.","<h4>Background</h4>There have been repeated initiatives to produce standard nosologies and terminologies for cutaneous disease, some dedicated to the domain and some part of bigger terminologies such as ICD-10.

10.1080/21505594.2018.1556150,Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii clinical isolates from Thailand display diverse phenotypic interactions with macrophages.,"Cryptococcus-macrophage interaction is crucial in the development of cryptococcocal diseases. C. neoformans and C. gattii are major pathogenic species that occupy different niches and cause different clinical manifestations. However, the differences of macrophage interaction among these species in affecting different disease outcomes and immune responses have not been clearly addressed. Here, we examined the macrophage uptake rates, intracellular loads and intracellular proliferation rates of C. neoformans and C. gattii clinical isolates from Thailand and analyzed the effect of those interactions on fungal burdens and host immune responses. C. neoformans isolates showed a higher phagocytosis rate but lower intracellular proliferation rate than C. gattii. Indeed, the high intracellular proliferation rate of C. gattii isolates did not influence the fungal burdens in lungs and brains of infected mice, whereas infection with high-uptake C. neoformans isolates resulted in significantly higher brain burdens that associated with reduced survival rate. Interestingly, alveolar macrophages of mice infected with high-uptake C. neoformans isolates showed distinct patterns of alternatively activated macrophage (M2) gene expressions with higher Arg1, Fizz1, Il13 and lower Nos2, Ifng, Il6, Tnfa, Mcp1, csf2 and Ip10 transcripts. Corresponding to this finding, infection with high-uptake C. neoformans resulted in enhanced arginase enzyme activity, elevated IL-4 and IL-13 and lowered IL-17 in the bronchoalveolar lavage. Thus, our data suggest that the macrophage interaction with C. neoformans and C. gattii may affect different disease outcomes and the high phagocytosis rates of C. neoformans influence the induction of type-2 immune responses that support fungal dissemination and disease progression.

10.1186/s12887-016-0607-9,Systematic review of published trials: long-term safety of topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors in pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Many clinicians have concerns about the safety of atopic dermatitis (AD) treatments, particularly in children requiring long-term daily maintenance therapy. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) have been widely used for >5 decades. Long-term TCS monotherapy has been associated with adverse cutaneous effects including atrophy, rebound flares, and increased percutaneous absorption with potential for adverse systemic effects. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, available for 1-2 decades, are not associated with atrophy or increased percutaneous absorption after prolonged use and have much lower potential for systemic effects. However, since 2006 TCIs have carried a controversial Boxed Warning based on a theoretical risk of malignancy (eg, skin and lymphoma) that has limited TCI use for standard-of-care maintenance therapy.<h4>Methods</h4>A comparative systematic search of PubMed was done for long-term (≥12 week) clinical trials of TCS or TCI treatment in patients <12 years with AD. Citations were reviewed for inclusion based on MeSH terms, abstracts, and relevant article text. Studies were excluded if they did not encompass subjects <12 years, or were <12 weeks' duration, retrospective, meta-analyses, or limited to anecdotal case reports.<h4>Results</h4>Of 27 trials meeting criteria, 21 included 5825 pediatric patients treated with TCIs, and 6 included 1999 patients treated with TCS. TCS studies were limited to low- to mid-potency products, and all but one study lacked a vehicle control. Eight TCI studies were vehicle-controlled, and safety data were well reported, with ≤5 % of patients reporting discontinuation due to adverse effects (DAEs). Cutaneous and systemic adverse events (AEs) were similar in TCI and vehicle groups, with no reports of lymphoma. Safety data in TCS trials were less well reported. DAE incidence was addressed in just 2 trials, and systemic and cutaneous AEs were mostly unreported.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Data supporting long-term use of TCIs are robust, documenting safety and efficacy, while data supporting long-term TCS use are limited to low- to mid-potency products. Our review identifies a lack of information on the safety of commonly prescribed, long-term monotherapy with mid- to high-potency TCS in pediatric AD, and supports standard-of-care maintenance therapy with TCIs and intermittent use of low- to mid-potency TCS for flares.","<h4>Background</h4>Many clinicians have concerns about the safety of atopic dermatitis (AD) treatments, particularly in children requiring long-term daily maintenance therapy.

Based on our discovery that the glycosaminoglycan dermatan sulfate (DS) displays peculiar affinity to apoptotic cells and autoantigens (autoAgs) and that DS-autoAg complexes cooperatively stimulate autoreactive B1 cell responses, we compiled a database of 751 candidate autoAgs from six human cell types. At least 657 of these have been found to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection based on currently available multi-omic COVID data, and at least 400 are confirmed targets of autoantibodies in a wide array of autoimmune diseases and cancer. The autoantigen-ome is significantly associated with various processes in viral infections, such as translation, protein processing, and vesicle transport. Interestingly, the coding genes of autoAgs predominantly contain multiple exons with many possible alternative splicing variants, short transcripts, and short UTR lengths. These observations and the finding that numerous autoAgs involved in RNA-splicing showed altered expression in viral infections suggest that viruses exploit alternative splicing to reprogram host cell machinery to ensure viral replication and survival. While each cell type gives rise to a unique pool of autoAgs, 39 common autoAgs associated with cell stress and apoptosis were identified from all six cell types, with several being known markers of systemic autoimmune diseases. In particular, the common autoAg UBA1 that catalyzes the first step in ubiquitination is encoded by an X-chromosome escape gene. Given its essential function in apoptotic cell clearance and that X-inactivation escape tends to increase with aging, UBA1 dysfunction can therefore predispose aging women to autoimmune disorders. In summary, we propose a model of how viral infections lead to extensive molecular alterations and host cell death, autoimmune responses facilitated by autoAg-DS complexes, and ultimately autoimmune diseases. Overall, this master autoantigen-ome provides a molecular guide for investigating the myriad of autoimmune sequalae to COVID-19 and clues to the rare adverse effects of the currently available mRNA and viral vector-based COVID vaccines.","Chronic and debilitating autoimmune sequelae pose a grave concern for the post-COVID-19 pandemic era.

10.1371/journal.pone.0232947,Comparative efficacy of antibiotic(s) alone or in combination of corticosteroids in adults with acute bacterial meningitis: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To compare relative efficacy of different antibiotic therapies either with or without the addition of corticosteroids among adult patients with acute bacterial meningitis on all-cause mortality, neurological complications and any hearing loss.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched nine databases from inception to 8 February 2018 for randomized controlled trials evaluating pharmacological interventions and clinical outcomes in adult bacterial meningitis. An updated search from 9 February to 9 March 2020 was performed, and no new studies met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system was used for quality of evidences evaluation. Meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the risk ratio with 95% confidence interval for both direct and indirect comparisons on the primary outcomes of all-cause mortality, neurologic sequelae and any hearing loss. The study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018108062).<h4>Results</h4>Nine RCTs were included in systematic review, involving 1,002 participants with a mean age ranging between 25.3 to 50.56 years. Six RCTs were finally included in the network-meta analysis. No significant difference between treatment was noted in meta-analysis. Network meta-analysis suggests that corticosteroids in combination with antibiotic therapy was more effective in reducing the risk of any hearing loss compared to mono antibiotic therapy (RR 0.64; 95%CI, 0.45 to 0.91, 4 RCTs, moderate certainty of evidence). Numerical lower risk of mortality and neurological complications was also shown for adjunctive corticosteroids in combination with antibiotic therapy versus mono antibiotic therapy (RR 0.65; 95%CI, 0.42 to 1.02, 6 RCTs, moderate certainty of evidence; RR 0.75; 95%CI, 0.47 to 1.18, 6 RCTs, moderate certainty of evidence). No differences were noted in the adverse events between different therapies. The overall certainty of evidence was moderate to very low for all primary outcomes examined.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Results of this study suggest that corticosteroids therapy in combination with antibiotic is more effective than mono antibiotic therapy in reducing the risk of any hearing loss in adult patients with acute bacterial meningitis. More well-design RCTs to investigate relative effective treatments in acute bacterial meningitis particularly in adult population should be mandated to aid clinicians in treatment recommendations.","<h4>Objective</h4>To compare relative efficacy of different antibiotic therapies either with or without the addition of corticosteroids among adult patients with acute bacterial meningitis on all-cause mortality, neurological complications and any hearing loss.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched nine databases from inception to 8 February 2018 for randomized controlled trials evaluating pharmacological interventions and clinical outcomes in adult bacterial meningitis.

10.1186/s12906-021-03445-5,Activity of antifungal drugs and Brazilian red and green propolis extracted with different methodologies against oral isolates of Candida spp.,"<h4>Background</h4>Oral candidiasis is an opportunistic disease caused by fungi of the Candida genus. The occurrence of Candida spp. resistance to the commercial antifungal drugs points to the search for alternative treatments. Propolis has been successfully used in the treatment of infectious diseases for centuries. It has been proposed that an ultrasound pretreatment in the propolis extraction protocol can enhance the concentrations of molecules with antimicrobial activities in the final extract. Thus, this study aimed to compare the antifungal activity against oral Candida spp. isolates of green and red propolis extracts submitted or not to an ultrasound pretreatment before the extraction procedure.<h4>Methods</h4>Candida spp. were isolated from denture stomatitis lesions and identified by sequencing. Oral Candida spp. isolates and reference strains were submitted to broth microdilution assays using commercial antifungals and Brazilian green and red propolis extracts submitted or not to an ultrasound pretreatment. Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) and Minimal Fungicide Concentrations (MFC) were determined and biofilm formation interference was evaluated for resistant isolates.<h4>Results</h4>C. albicans, Candida tropicalis and Candida dubliniensis were isolated from denture stomatitis lesions. Growth inhibition was observed in all Candida isolates incubated with all green and red propolis extracts. At lower doses, red propolis extracts presented significant antifungal activity. The ultrasound pretreatment did not promote an increase in the antifungal activity of green or red propolis. Three isolates, which were highly resistant to fluconazole and itraconazole, were susceptible to low doses of red propolis extracts. These same three specimens had their biofilm formation inhibted by red propolis ethanolic extract.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Thus, red propolis can be faced as a promising natural product to be used in the auxiliary antifungal therapy of denture stomatitis.","<h4>Background</h4>Oral candidiasis is an opportunistic disease caused by fungi of the Candida genus.

This study is the first to use molecular markers to evaluate the genetic diversity of eighteen Egyptian wheat genotypes. Moreover, the molecular docking analysis was also used to assess the Cu-chitosan nanoparticle (CuChNp) treatment and its mode of action in disease control management. The tested genotypes were categorized into two main cluster groups depending on the similarity matrix, i.e the most resistant and susceptible genotypes to stem and leaf rust races. The results of SCoT primers revealed 140 polymorphic and 5 monomorphic bands with 97% polymorphism. While 121 polymorphic and 74 monomorphic bands were scored for SRAP primers (99% polymorphism). The genotypes Sakha 94, Sakha 95, Beni Sweif 4, Beni Sweif 7, Sohag 4 and Sohag 5 were resistant, while Giza 160 was highly susceptible to all stem rust races at the seedling stage. However, in the adult stage, the 18 genotypes were evaluated for stem and leaf rust-resistant in two different locations, i.e. Giza and Sids. In this investigation, for the first time, the activity of CuChNp was studied and shown to have the potential to inhibit stem and leaf rust in studied Egyptian wheat genotypes. The Spraying Cu-chitosan nanoparticles showed that the incubation and latent periods were increased in treated plants of the tested genotypes. Molecular modeling revealed their activity against the stem and leaf rust development. The SRAP and SCoT markers were highly useful tools for the classification of the tested wheat genotypes, although they displayed high similarities at the morphological stage.

Procalcitonin (PCT) showed promising potential in early diagnosis of GNBSI; however, little was known about its performance under different clinical settings. We here systematically assessed the diagnostic accuracy of PCT in recognizing GNBSI and made direct comparisons with C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6).<h4>Methods</h4>PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Scopus were searched from inception to March 15th, 2019. Area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated. Hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model was used for the investigation of heterogeneity and for comparisons between markers.<h4>Results</h4>25 studies incorporating 50933 suspected BSI episodes were included. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for PCT were 0.71 and 0.76, respectively. The overall AUC was 0.80. The lowest AUCs were found in patients with febrile neutropenia (0.69) and hematological malignancy (0.69). The highest AUC was found in groups using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (0.87). In direct comparisons, PCT showed better overall performance than CRP with the AUC being 0.85 (95% CI 0.81-0.87) for PCT and 0.78 (95% CI 0.74-0.81) for CRP, but the relative DORs varied with thresholds between PCT and CRP (<i>p</i> < 0.001). No significant difference was found either in threshold (<i>p</i> < 0.001). No significant difference was found either in threshold (<i>p</i> < 0.001).

10.3389/fpls.2021.734248,Structural and Evolutionary Analyses of PR-4 SUGARWINs Points to a Different Pattern of Protein Function.,"SUGARWINs are PR-4 proteins associated with sugarcane defense against phytopathogens. Their expression is induced in response to damage by <i>Diatraea saccharalis</i> larvae. These proteins play an important role in plant defense, in particular against fungal pathogens, such as <i>Colletothricum falcatum</i> (Went) and <i>Fusarium verticillioides</i>. The pathogenesis-related protein-4 (PR-4) family is a group of proteins equipped with a BARWIN domain, which may be associated with a chitin-binding domain also known as the hevein-like domain. Several PR-4 proteins exhibit both chitinase and RNase activity, with the latter being associated with the presence of two histidine residues H11 and H113 (BARWIN) [H44 and H146, SUGARWINs] in the BARWIN-like domain. In sugarcane, similar to other PR-4 proteins, SUGARWIN1 exhibits ribonuclease, chitosanase and chitinase activities, whereas SUGARWIN2 only exhibits chitosanase activity. In order to decipher the structural determinants involved in this diverse range of enzyme specificities, we determined the 3-D structure of SUGARWIN2, at 1.55Å by X-ray diffraction. This is the first structure of a PR-4 protein where the first histidine has been replaced by asparagine and was subsequently used to build a homology model for SUGARWIN1. Molecular dynamics simulations of both proteins revealed the presence of a flexible loop only in SUGARWIN1 and we postulate that this, together with the presence of the catalytic histidine at position 42, renders it competent as a ribonuclease. The more electropositive surface potential of SUGARWIN1 would also be expected to favor complex formation with RNA. A phylogenetic analysis of PR-4 proteins obtained from 106 Embryophyta genomes showed that both catalytic histidines are widespread among them with few replacements in these amino acid positions during the gene family evolutionary history. We observe that the H11 replacement by N11 is also present in two other sugarcane PR-4 proteins: SUGARWIN3 and SUGARWIN4. We propose that RNase activity was present in the first Embryophyta PR-4 proteins but was recently lost in members of this family during the course of evolution.","SUGARWINs are PR-4 proteins associated with sugarcane defense against phytopathogens.

When the organic source had a low C:N ratio, AM fungi favored both plant N uptake and N recovery. In contrast, when the organic source had a high C:N ratio, a clear reduction in N recovery from the fertilizer was observed.

10.1007/s12026-014-8562-8,Silenced suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) enhances the maturation and antifungal immunity of dendritic cells in response to Candida albicans in vitro.,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are known to play an important role in initiating and orchestrating antimicrobial immunity. Given the fact that candidiasis appears often in immunocompromised patients, it seems plausible that DCs hold the key to new antifungal strategies. One possibility to enhance the potency of DC-based immunotherapy is to silence the negative immunoregulatory pathways through the ablation suppressor of cytokine signaling suppressor 1 (SOCS1). Here, we deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) against SOCS1 into murine bone marrow DCs, and as a consequence, we investigate the maturation/action of DCs and the subsequent T cell response after exposure to C. albicans. Our results show that the maturation of DCs (i.e., expressions of CD80, CD40, CD86, and MHC II) are significantly increased in the silenced SOCS1 treatment group after exposure to C. albicans. As a result, suppression of the SOCS1 promotes the greatest expression of IFN-γ and IL-12, and reduces IL-4 secretions, which induce CD4(+) cell Th1 differentiation but inactivate Th2 cell development. The responses of IL-6 and TNF-β consist of up-regulation in the presence of C. albicans, but this is not specific to SOCS1 silencing, suggesting that these cytokines are not regulated by the SOCS1 gene in fungal infections. We find Th17 differentiation is unchanged regardless of SOCS1 inhibition. The increase in phagocytosis and killing of C. albicans in SOCS1 gene-treated DCs indicate a role for this cytokine suppressor in innate immunity as well. In conclusion, our findings support the view that SOCS1 protein is a critical inhibitory molecule for controlling cytokine response and antigen presentation by DCs, thereby regulating the magnitude of innate and adaptive immunities by generating IFN-γ-production T cells (Th1)--but not Th17--from naïve CD4(+) T cells. Our study demonstrates that SOCS1 siRNA can serve as a useful vehicle to modulate the function of DCs against C. albicans infection.","Dendritic cells (DCs) are known to play an important role in initiating and orchestrating antimicrobial immunity.

The prepared fluconazole proniosomal gels were evaluated for various parameters such as particle size (PS), drug entrapment efficiency percentage (EE%), and <i>in vitro</i> drug release. The experimental results showed that the EE% for the prepared formulae are acceptable (85.14%-97.66%) and they are nanosized (19.8-50.1 nm) and the diffusion from the gels gave the desired sustaining effect. F4, which was prepared from span 60, tween 80 (1:1), and cholesterol showed highest EE% and gave slow release (40.50% ± 1.50% after 6 h), was subjected to zeta potential (ZP) test, transmission electron microscopy as well as microbiological study. The results showed a well-defined spherical vesicle with sharp boundaries with good physical stability of fluconazole within the prepared gel. Moreover, F4 showed an excellent microbiological activity represented by a greater zone of inhibition (5.3 cm) compared to control gel (fluconazole in 2% hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) gel formula) (4.2 cm) and plain gel with no drug (0 cm) against <i>Candida albicans</i>.

The situation becomes more worrying when taking into account that, in both environmental and disease scenarios, microorganisms present themselves as biofilm communities that are often polymicrobial. This comprises a competitive advantage, with interactions between different species altering host responses, antimicrobial effectiveness, microbial pathogenesis and virulence, usually augmenting the severity of the infection and contributing for the recalcitrance towards conventional therapy. <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Candida albicans</i> are two opportunistic pathogens often co-isolated from infections, mainly from mucosal tissues like the lung. Despite the billions of years of co-existence, this pair of microorganisms is a great example on how little is known about cross-kingdom interactions, particularly within the context of coinfections. Given the described scenario, this study aimed to collect, curate, and analyze all published experimental information on the molecular basis of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>C. albicans</i> interactions in biofilms, in order to shed light into key mechanisms that may affect infection prognosis, increasing this area of knowledge. Publications were optimally retrieved from PubMed and Web of Science and classified as to their relevance. Data was then systematically and manually curated, analyzed, and further reconstructed as networks. A total of 641 interactions between the two pathogens were annotated, outputting knowledge on important molecular players affecting key virulence mechanisms, such as hyphal growth, and related genes and proteins, constituting potential therapeutic targets for infections related to these bacterial-fungal consortia. Contrasting interactions were also analyzed, and quorum-sensing inhibition approaches were highlighted. All annotated data was made publicly available at www.ceb.uminho.pt/ISCTD, a database already containing similar data for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> communication. This will allow researchers to cut on time and effort when studying this particular subject, facilitating the understanding of the basis of the inter-species and inter-kingdom interactions and how it can be modulated to help design alternative and more effective tailored therapies. Finally, data deposition will serve as base for future dataset integration, whose analysis will hopefully give insights into communications in more complex and varied biofilm communities.","Modern medicine is currently facing huge setbacks concerning infection therapeutics as microorganisms are consistently knocking down every antimicrobial wall set before them.

10.1038/s41598-019-44248-6,Intraspecific Competition Affects the Pupation Behavior of Spotted-Wing Drosophila (Drosophila suzukii).,"In Drosophila, intraspecific competition (IC) may cause stress, cannibalism, and affect survival and reproduction. By migrating to less crowded environments, individuals can escape IC. Larvae of spotted-wing drosophila (SWD, Drosophila suzukii) are often exposed to IC. They are known to pupate either attached to or detached from their hosts. Here, we hypothesized that SWD pupates detached from the larval host as a means to escape IC and increase their survival and fitness. Under laboratory conditions, IC resulted in increased pupation detached from the larval host in both cornmeal medium and blueberry fruit. Males were more prone to detached pupation than females. In blueberry, IC-exposed larvae pupated farther away from the fruit relative to singly-developed individuals. Detached pupation was associated to survival and fitness gains. For example, larvae that displayed detached pupation showed shorter egg-pupa development times, higher pupa-adult survival, and larger adult size relative to fruit-attached individuals. These findings demonstrate that SWD larvae select pupation sites based on IC, and that such a strategy is associated with improved survival and fitness. This information contributes to a better understanding of SWD basic biology and behavior, offering insights to the development of improved practices to manage this pest in the field.","In Drosophila, intraspecific competition (IC) may cause stress, cannibalism, and affect survival and reproduction.

To compare the efficacy and safety of MCFG and triazoles in the prevention and treatment of IFIs, we conducted a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA).<h4>Methods</h4>For the meta-analysis, we systematically searched the databases of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and relevant database articles for randomized controlled studies published through November 2016. Comparative studies of the efficacy and safety of MCFG versus triazoles in the prevention and treatment of IFIs were selected. Meta-analysis was performed by R software with the ""metafor"" package. Pooled results were expressed as risk ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). TSA was adopted to assess the studies' power with TSA version 0.9 beta.<h4>Results</h4>Nine current studies were included in the meta-analysis (1049 cases and 959 controls). Pooled trial comparisons indicated that MCFG does have significantly higher treatment success rates (RR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.25; p = 0.0205) and reduces the number of overall IFIs (RR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.92; p = 0.0056). However, MCFG demonstrates no difference in all-cause mortality (RR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.52-1.12, p = 0.1624). For the safety evaluation, MCFG had a significantly lower incidence of severe adverse events (AEs) (RR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.25-0.83; p = 0.0105), hepatic impairment (RR = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.97; p = 0.0363) and premature discontinuation (RR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.34-0.76, p = 0.0010). Meta-regression analysis disclosed the correction of mean age and treatment success rates (P < 0.0001). Meanwhile, TSA demonstrated sufficient power to show efficacy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The treatment success rate of MCFG is superior to that of triazoles for the prophylaxis and treatment of IFIs, and correction of the mean patient age demonstrates that efficacy increases as patient age decreases. MCFG appears to be well-tolerated with manageable side effects and lower withdrawal rates. However, additional clinical trials should be conducted on specific drug-related mortality and AEs to gather sufficient evidence on these matters.","<h4>Background</h4>Current studies that compare the efficacy and safety of micafungin (MCFG) with that of triazoles for the prophylaxis and treatment of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) demonstrate a lack of sufficient evidence and yield conflicting results.

10.3390/cells8111348,Glycobiology of Human Fungal Pathogens: New Avenues for Drug Development.,"Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are an increasing threat to the developing world, with fungal spores being ubiquitous and inhaled every day. Some fungal species are commensal organisms that are part of the normal human microbiota, and, as such, do not pose a threat to the immune system. However, when the natural balance of this association is disturbed or the host's immune system is compromised, these fungal pathogens overtake the organism, and cause IFI. To understand the invasiveness of these pathogens and to address the growing problem of IFI, it is essential to identify the cellular processes of the invading organism and their virulence. In this review, we will discuss the prevalence and current options available to treat IFI, including recent reports of drug resistance. Nevertheless, the main focus of this review is to describe the glycobiology of human fungal pathogens and how various components of the fungal cell wall, particularly cell wall polysaccharides and glycoconjugates, are involved in fungal pathogenicity, their biosynthesis and how they can be potentially exploited to develop novel antifungal treatment options. We will specifically describe the nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) that are important in fungal survival and suggest that the inhibition of fungal NSTs may potentially be useful to prevent the establishment of fungal infections.","Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are an increasing threat to the developing world, with fungal spores being ubiquitous and inhaled every day. Some fungal species are commensal organisms that are part of the normal human microbiota, and, as such, do not pose a threat to the immune system. However, when the natural balance of this association is disturbed or the host's immune system is compromised, these fungal pathogens overtake the organism, and cause IFI. To understand the invasiveness of these pathogens and to address the growing problem of IFI, it is essential to identify the cellular processes of the invading organism and their virulence. In this review, we will discuss the prevalence and current options available to treat IFI, including recent reports of drug resistance.

However, anti-IL-17A therapy does not improve clinical outcomes in patients with Crohn's disease. We aimed to evaluate the role of RORγt<sup>+</sup> innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in murine colitis models in the absence of IL-17A. An acute colitis model was induced with either dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) or trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) and a chronic colitis model was induced by CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RB<sup>hi</sup> T cell transfer from either wild-type C57BL/6 or Il17a<sup>-/-</sup> mice. An anti-IL-17A antibody, secukinumab, was also used to inhibit IL-17A function in the colitis model. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze the population of RORγt<sup>+</sup> ILCs in the colonic lamina propria of mice with chronic colitis. Acute intestinal inflammation due to DSS and TNBS was attenuated in IL-17A knockout mice, whereas chronic colitis was not relieved by T cell transfer from Il17a<sup>-/-</sup> mice (% of original body weight: wild-type mice vs. Il17a<sup>-/-</sup> mice, 81.9% vs. 82.2%; P = 0.922). However, the mean proportion of Lin<sup>-</sup>RORγt<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes was higher after T cell transfer from Il17a<sup>-/-</sup> mice than that after T cell transfer from wild-type mice (28.8% vs. 18.5%). The proportion of Lin<sup>-</sup>RORγt<sup>+</sup> was also increased in Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mice that received T cell transfer from wild-type mice when anti-IL-17A antibody was administered (31.7%). Additionally, Il6 and Il22 tended to be highly expressed after T cell transfer from Il17a<sup>-/-</sup> mice. In conclusion, RORγt<sup>+</sup> ILCs may have an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic colitis in the absence of IL-17A. Blocking the function of IL-17A may upregulate Il6 and recruit RORγt<sup>+</sup> ILCs in chronic colitis, thereby upregulating IL-22 and worsening the clinical outcomes of patients with Crohn's disease.","IL-17A is an important cytokine in intestinal inflammation.

10.4317/jced.52556,Rapid prototyping modelling in oral and maxillofacial surgery: A two year retrospective study.,"<h4>Background</h4>The use of rapid prototyping (RP) models in medicine to construct bony models is increasing.<h4>Material and methods</h4>The aim of the study was to evaluate retrospectively the indication for the use of RP models in oral and maxillofacial surgery at Helsinki University Central Hospital during 2009-2010. Also, the used computed tomography (CT) examination - multislice CT (MSCT) or cone beam CT (CBCT) - method was evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>In total 114 RP models were fabricated for 102 patients. The mean age of the patients at the time of the production of the model was 50.4 years. The indications for the modelling included malignant lesions (29%), secondary reconstruction (25%), prosthodontic treatment (22%), orthognathic surgery or asymmetry (13%), benign lesions (8%), and TMJ disorders (4%). MSCT examination was used in 92 and CBCT examination in 22 cases. Most of the models (75%) were conventional hard tissue models. Models with colored tumour or other structure(s) of interest were ordered in 24%. Two out of the 114 models were soft tissue models.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The main benefit of the models was in treatment planning and in connection with the production of pre-bent plates or custom made implants. The RP models both facilitate and improve treatment planning and intraoperative efficiency.<h4>Key words</h4>Rapid prototyping, radiology, computed tomography, cone beam computed tomography.","<h4>Background</h4>The use of rapid prototyping (RP) models in medicine to construct bony models is increasing.<h4>Material and methods</h4>The aim of the study was to evaluate retrospectively the indication for the use of RP models in oral and maxillofacial surgery at Helsinki University Central Hospital during 2009-2010.

10.1038/s41598-020-78910-1,"Gene diversity explains variation in biological features of insect killing fungus, Beauveria bassiana.","Beauveria bassiana is a species complex whose isolates show considerable natural genetic variability. However, little is known about how this genetic diversity affects the fungus performance. Herein, we characterized the diversity of genes involved in various mechanisms of the infective cycle of 42 isolates that have different growth rates, thermotolerance and virulence. The analysed genes showed general genetic diversity measured as non-synonymous changes (NSC) and copy number variation (CNV), with most of them being subjected to positive episodic diversifying selection. Correlation analyses between NSC or CNV and the isolate virulence, thermotolerance and growth rate revealed that various genes shaped the biological features of the fungus. Lectin-like, mucin signalling, Biotrophy associated and chitinase genes NSCs correlated with the three biological features of B. bassiana. In addition, other genes (i.e. DNA photolyase and cyclophilin B) that had relatively conserved sequences, had variable CNs across the isolates which were correlated with the variability of either virulence or thermotolerance of B. bassiana isolates. The data obtained is important for a better understanding of population structure, ecological and potential impact when isolates are used as mycoinsecticides and can justify industrialization of new isolates.","Beauveria bassiana is a species complex whose isolates show considerable natural genetic variability.

10.1002/14651858.cd014758.pub2,Interventions for myopia control in children: a living systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Myopia is a common refractive error, where elongation of the eyeball causes distant objects to appear blurred. The increasing prevalence of myopia is a growing global public health problem, in terms of rates of uncorrected refractive error and significantly, an increased risk of visual impairment due to myopia-related ocular morbidity. Since myopia is usually detected in children before 10 years of age and can progress rapidly, interventions to slow its progression need to be delivered in childhood.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the comparative efficacy of optical, pharmacological and environmental interventions for slowing myopia progression in children using network meta-analysis (NMA). To generate a relative ranking of myopia control interventions according to their efficacy. To produce a brief economic commentary, summarising the economic evaluations assessing myopia control interventions in children. To maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach.  SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register), MEDLINE; Embase; and three trials registers. The search date was 26 February 2022.  SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of optical, pharmacological and environmental interventions for slowing myopia progression in children aged 18 years or younger. Critical outcomes were progression of myopia (defined as the difference in the change in spherical equivalent refraction (SER, dioptres (D)) and axial length (mm) in the intervention and control groups at one year or longer) and difference in the change in SER and axial length following cessation of treatment ('rebound').  DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methods. We assessed bias using RoB 2 for parallel RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the outcomes: change in SER and axial length at one and two years. Most comparisons were with inactive controls.<h4>Main results</h4>We included 64 studies that randomised 11,617 children, aged 4 to 18 years. Studies were mostly conducted in China or other Asian countries (39 studies, 60.9%) and North America (13 studies, 20.3%). Fifty-seven studies (89%) compared myopia control interventions (multifocal spectacles, peripheral plus spectacles (PPSL), undercorrected single vision spectacles (SVLs), multifocal soft contact lenses (MFSCL), orthokeratology, rigid gas-permeable contact lenses (RGP); or pharmacological interventions (including high- (HDA), moderate- (MDA) and low-dose (LDA) atropine, pirenzipine or 7-methylxanthine) against an inactive control. Study duration was 12 to 36 months. The overall certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Since the networks in the NMA were poorly connected, most estimates versus control were as, or more, imprecise than the corresponding direct estimates. Consequently, we mostly report estimates based on direct (pairwise) comparisons below. At one year, in 38 studies (6525 participants analysed), the median change in SER for controls was -0.65 D. The following interventions may reduce SER progression compared to controls: HDA (mean difference (MD) 0.90 D, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.18), MDA (MD 0.65 D, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.03), LDA (MD 0.38 D, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.66), pirenzipine (MD 0.32 D, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.49), MFSCL (MD 0.26 D, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.35), PPSLs (MD 0.51 D, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.82), and multifocal spectacles (MD 0.14 D, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.21). By contrast, there was little or no evidence that RGP (MD 0.02 D, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.10), 7-methylxanthine (MD 0.07 D, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.24) or undercorrected SVLs (MD -0.15 D, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.00) reduce progression.  At two years, in 26 studies (4949 participants), the median change in SER for controls was -1.02 D. The following interventions may reduce SER progression compared to controls: HDA (MD 1.26 D, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.36), MDA (MD 0.45 D, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.83), LDA (MD 0.24 D, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.31), pirenzipine (MD 0.41 D, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.69), MFSCL (MD 0.30 D, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.41), and multifocal spectacles  (MD 0.19 D, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.30). PPSLs (MD 0.34 D, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.76) may also reduce progression, but the results were inconsistent. For RGP, one study found a benefit and another found no difference with control. We found no difference in SER change for undercorrected SVLs (MD 0.02 D, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.09). At one year, in 36 studies (6263 participants), the median change in axial length for controls was 0.31 mm. The following interventions may reduce axial elongation compared to controls: HDA (MD -0.33 mm, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.30), MDA (MD -0.28 mm, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.17), LDA (MD -0.13 mm, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.05), orthokeratology (MD -0.19 mm, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.15), MFSCL (MD -0.11 mm, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.09), pirenzipine (MD -0.10 mm, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02), PPSLs (MD -0.13 mm, 95% CI -0.24 to -0.03), and multifocal spectacles (MD -0.06 mm, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.04). We found little or no evidence that RGP (MD 0.02 mm, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.10), 7-methylxanthine (MD 0.03 mm, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.03) or undercorrected SVLs (MD 0.05 mm, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.11) reduce axial length. At two years, in 21 studies (4169 participants), the median change in axial length for controls was 0.56 mm. The following interventions may reduce axial elongation compared to controls: HDA (MD -0.47mm, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.34), MDA (MD -0.33 mm, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.20), orthokeratology (MD -0.28 mm, (95% CI -0.38 to -0.19), LDA (MD -0.16 mm, 95% CI -0.20 to  -0.12), MFSCL (MD -0.15 mm, 95% CI -0.19 to -0.12), and multifocal spectacles (MD -0.07 mm, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.03). PPSL may reduce progression (MD -0.20 mm, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.05) but results were inconsistent. We found little or no evidence that undercorrected SVLs (MD -0.01 mm, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.03) or RGP (MD 0.03 mm, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.12) reduce axial length. There was inconclusive evidence on whether treatment cessation increases myopia progression. Adverse events and treatment adherence were not consistently reported, and only one study reported quality of life. No studies reported environmental interventions reporting progression in children with myopia, and no economic evaluations assessed interventions for myopia control in children.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Studies mostly compared pharmacological and optical treatments to slow the progression of myopia with an inactive comparator. Effects at one year provided evidence that these interventions may slow refractive change and reduce axial elongation, although results were often heterogeneous. A smaller body of evidence is available at two or three years, and uncertainty remains about the sustained effect of these interventions. Longer-term and better-quality studies comparing myopia control interventions used alone or in combination are needed, and improved methods for monitoring and reporting adverse effects.","<h4>Background</h4>Myopia is a common refractive error, where elongation of the eyeball causes distant objects to appear blurred.

In order to reduce the AFB<sub>1</sub> in corn, corn kernels were processed with Water-assisted Microwaves Treatment (WMT) and the feasibility of WMT processing on AFB<sub>1</sub> reduction and its effects on corn quality were analyzed. Increasing the treatment time and microwave power could increase the reduction of AFB<sub>1</sub>, and the maximum reduction rate could reach 58.6% and 56.8%, respectively. There was no significant correlation between the initial concentration of AFB<sub>1</sub> and the reduction rate of AFB<sub>1</sub>. During WMT, the main toxigenic molds were sterilized completely, and the moisture content of corn climbed up and then declined to the initial level. WMT could obviously increase the fatty acid value and pasting temperature of corn and reduce the all paste viscosity of corn. However, it had little effect on the color of corn. The results indicated that WMT could reduce AFB<sub>1</sub> effectively and avoid the vast appearance of heat-damaged kernels simultaneously. Undoubtedly, water played an important role in WMT. This result provides a new idea for the reduction of AFB<sub>1</sub> by microwave.","Aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>) is one of the most commonly found mycotoxin in corn, which is highly toxic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic for the health of humans and animals.

10.3389/fmicb.2017.00841,Rodent Models of Invasive Aspergillosis due to <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>: Still a Long Path toward Standardization.,"Invasive aspergillosis has been studied in laboratory by the means of plethora of distinct animal models. They were developed to address pathophysiology, therapy, diagnosis, or miscellaneous other concerns associated. However, there are great discrepancies regarding all the experimental variables of animal models, and a thorough focus on them is needed. This systematic review completed a comprehensive bibliographic analysis specifically-based on the technical features of rodent models infected with <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>.

The World Bank's statistics about gross national income (GNI) per capita were used to categorise low-income, lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income, and high-income countries. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase databases were searched to gather updated evidence about the adverse consequences of smoking on oral health among adolescents.<h4>Results</h4>The prevalence of tobacco use was 19.33%, and there were 23.29% of male and 15.35% female smoker adolescents in 133 countries (p < 0.001). The highest prevalence of tobacco use in male (24.76%) and female (19.4) adolescents was found in high-income countries. Significantly higher proportions of male adolescents were smokers than female counterparts in low-income, lower-middle-income, and upper-middle-income (p < 0.001). However, there were no statistically significant differences in tobacco use between male and female adolescents in high-income countries. Low-income countries had the lowest prevalence (14.95%) of tobacco use, while high-income countries had the highest prevalence estimates (22.08). Gingivitis (72.8%), gingival bleeding (51.2%), oral malodor or halitosis (39.6%) is common oral conditions among smoker adolescents. Smoking habit is significantly associated with dental caries, periodontal disease, hairy tongue, smoking-related melanosis, and hyperkeratosis among adolescents.<h4>Conclusion</h4>There was a high prevalence of tobacco use among male and female adolescents around the globe. Available evidence suggests a strong association between smoking and compromised oral health among adolescents.

However, the underlying etiology of this disease has not yet been well established. Several trials have revealed that serum vitamin D level abnormality might play a role in the pathophysiology of chronic rhinosinusitis.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of present study was to perform a meta-analysis of studies to compare the serum vitamin D levels between patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and healthy controls and to evaluate the potential associations of serum vitamin D level with the occurrence of chronic rhinosinusitis.<h4>Methods</h4>Following the PRISMA guidelines, relevant databases incorporating Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to December 1, 2018. Funnel plot symmetry and Egger' test were used to detect publication biases. The outcomes were presented as Weighted Mean Difference combined with 95% Confidence Intervals to estimate the difference of serum vitamin D levels between patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and controls. Higgins I<sup>2</sup> value was used to test for heterogeneity between the included studies.<h4>Results</h4>Out of 176 studies, only eight studies involving 337 chronic rhinosinusitis patients and 179 healthy controls met the criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. In a pooled analysis of the studies, chronic rhinosinusitis patients showed decreased serum vitamin D status (WMD=-7.80, 95% CI -13.28 to -2.31, p=0.000). Subgroups analyses based on study location (USA vs. Non-USA), types of biomarkers (25(OH)D3 vs. 25(OH)D) and the study design methods (retrospective vs. prospective) did not reveal heterogeneity. However, phenotypes of chronic rhinosinusitis, with versus without polyposis might account for some degree of heterogeneity. Meanwhile, a lower serum vitamin D level was observed in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings indicate that serum vitamin D level might be associated with patients with chronic rhinosinusitis as we detected a significant association between lower serum vitamin D status and chronic rhinosinusitis, especially in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps patients. However, further comprehensive studies are warranted in order to draw firm conclusions.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Chronic rhinosinusitis is a highly heterogeneous chronic inflammation of the upper respiratory tract caused by immune dysfunction in human beings.

10.7717/peerj.6018,When and where to hatch? Red-eyed treefrog embryos use light cues in two contexts.,"Hatching timing is under strong selection and environmentally cued in many species. Embryos use multiple sensory modalities to inform hatching timing and many have spontaneous hatching patterns adaptively synchronized to natural cycles. Embryos can also adaptively shift their hatching timing in response to environmental cues indicating immediate threats or opportunities. Such cued shifts in hatching are widespread among amphibians; however, we know little about what, if anything, regulates their spontaneous hatching. Moreover, in addition to selection on hatching timing, embryos may experience benefits or suffer costs due to the spatial orientation of hatching. Amphibian eggs generally lack internal constraints on hatching direction but embryos might, nonetheless, use external cues to inform hatching orientation. The terrestrial embryos of red-eyed treefrogs, <i>Agalychnis callidryas</i>, hatch rapidly and prematurely in response to vibrational cues in egg-predator attacks and hypoxia if flooded. Here we examined <i>A. callidryas'</i> use of light cues in hatching timing and orientation. To assess patterns of spontaneous hatching and the role of light cues in their diel timing, we recorded hatching times for siblings distributed across three light environments: continuous light, continuous dark, and a 12L:12D photoperiod. Under a natural photoperiod, embryos showed a clear diel pattern of synchronous hatching shortly after nightfall. Hatching was desynchronized in both continuous light and continuous darkness. It was also delayed by continuous light, but not accelerated by continuous dark, suggesting the onset of dark serves as a hatching cue. We examined hatching orientation and light as a potential directional cue for flooded embryos. Embryos flooded in their clutches almost always hatched toward open water, whereas individual eggs flooded in glass cups often failed to do so, suggesting the natural context provides a directional cue. To test if flooded embryos orient hatching toward light, we placed individual eggs in tubes with one end illuminated and the other dark, then flooded them and recorded hatching direction. Most embryos hatched toward the light, suggesting they use light as a directional cue. Our results support that <i>A. callidryas</i> embryos use light cues to inform both when and where to hatch. Both the spatial orientation of hatching and the timing of spontaneous hatching may affect fitness and be informed by cues in a broader range of species than is currently appreciated.","Hatching timing is under strong selection and environmentally cued in many species.

10.1186/s12864-019-5629-x,The lichen symbiosis re-viewed through the genomes of Cladonia grayi and its algal partner Asterochloris glomerata.,"<h4>Background</h4>Lichens, encompassing 20,000 known species, are symbioses between specialized fungi (mycobionts), mostly ascomycetes, and unicellular green algae or cyanobacteria (photobionts). Here we describe the first parallel genomic analysis of the mycobiont Cladonia grayi and of its green algal photobiont Asterochloris glomerata. We focus on genes/predicted proteins of potential symbiotic significance, sought by surveying proteins differentially activated during early stages of mycobiont and photobiont interaction in coculture, expanded or contracted protein families, and proteins with differential rates of evolution.<h4>Results</h4>A) In coculture, the fungus upregulated small secreted proteins, membrane transport proteins, signal transduction components, extracellular hydrolases and, notably, a ribitol transporter and an ammonium transporter, and the alga activated DNA metabolism, signal transduction, and expression of flagellar components. B) Expanded fungal protein families include heterokaryon incompatibility proteins, polyketide synthases, and a unique set of G-protein α subunit paralogs. Expanded algal protein families include carbohydrate active enzymes and a specific subclass of cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrases. The alga also appears to have acquired by horizontal gene transfer from prokaryotes novel archaeal ATPases and Desiccation-Related Proteins. Expanded in both symbionts are signal transduction components, ankyrin domain proteins and transcription factors involved in chromatin remodeling and stress responses. The fungal transportome is contracted, as are algal nitrate assimilation genes. C) In the mycobiont, slow-evolving proteins were enriched for components involved in protein translation, translocation and sorting.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The surveyed genes affect stress resistance, signaling, genome reprogramming, nutritional and structural interactions. The alga carries many genes likely transferred horizontally through viruses, yet we found no evidence of inter-symbiont gene transfer. The presence in the photobiont of meiosis-specific genes supports the notion that sexual reproduction occurs in Asterochloris while they are free-living, a phenomenon with implications for the adaptability of lichens and the persistent autonomy of the symbionts. The diversity of the genes affecting the symbiosis suggests that lichens evolved by accretion of many scattered regulatory and structural changes rather than through introduction of a few key innovations. This predicts that paths to lichenization were variable in different phyla, which is consistent with the emerging consensus that ascolichens could have had a few independent origins.","<h4>Background</h4>Lichens, encompassing 20,000 known species, are symbioses between specialized fungi (mycobionts), mostly ascomycetes, and unicellular green algae or cyanobacteria (photobionts).

Eosinophilic asthma is the treatment-responsive endotype, which is mainly associated with allergic asthma. Neutrophilic asthma is a treatment-resistant endotype, affecting 5-10% of asthmatics. Although eosinophilic asthma is well-studied, a clear understanding of the endotypes is essential to devise effective diagnosis and treatment approaches for neutrophilic asthma. To this end, we directly compared adjuvant-induced mouse models of neutrophilic (CFA/OVA) and eosinophilic (Alum/OVA) asthma side-by-side. The immune response in the inflamed lung was analyzed by multi-parametric flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. We found that eosinophilic asthma was characterized by a preferential recruitment of interstitial macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells, whereas in neutrophilic asthma plasmacytoid dendritic cells, exudate macrophages, and GL7+ activated B cells predominated. This differential distribution of macrophage and dendritic cell subsets reveals important aspects of the pathophysiology of asthma and holds the promise to be used as biomarkers to diagnose asthma endotypes.","Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with neutrophilic and eosinophilic asthma as the main endotypes that are distinguished according to the cells recruited to the airways and the related pathology.

In this study, we biosynthesized spherical-shaped silicon dioxide nanoparticles (SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs; sized between 9.92 and 19.8 nm) using saffron extract and introduced them as a potential alternative therapeutic solution to protect wheat seedlings against <i>R. solani</i>. SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs showed strong dose-dependent fungistatic activity on <i>R. solani</i>, and significantly reduced mycelial radial growth (up to 100% growth reduction), mycelium fresh and dry weight, and pre-, post-emergence damping-off, and root rot severities. Moreover, the impact of SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs on the growth of wheat seedlings and their potential mechanism (s) for disease suppression was deciphered. SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs application also improved the germination, vegetative growth, and vigor indexes of infected wheat seedlings which indicates no phytotoxicity on treated wheat seedlings. Moreover, SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs enhanced the content of the photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids), induced the accumulation of defense-related compounds (particularly salicylic acid), and alleviated the oxidative stress via stimulation of both enzymatic (POD, SOD, APX, CAT, and PPO) and non-enzymatic (phenolics and flavonoids) antioxidant defense machinery. Collectively, our findings demonstrated the potential therapeutic role of SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs against <i>R. solani</i> infection via the simultaneous activation of a multilayered defense system to suppress the pathogen, neutralize the destructive effect of ROS, lipid peroxidation, and methylglyoxal, and maintain their homeostasis within <i>R. solani</i>-infected plants.","The phytopathogenic basidiomycetous fungus, <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>, has a wide range of host plants including members of the family Poaceae, causing damping-off and root rot diseases.

Current research and policy activity prioritizes the physical health of consumers yet few of these recommendations have translated to practice. This implementation gap may be influenced by the paucity of literature exploring consumer perceptions and experiences with physical healthcare and treatment. As a result, little is understood about the views and attitudes of consumers towards interventions designed to improve their physical health. This integrative review aims to explore the literature regarding consumer perspectives of physical healthcare and, interventions to improve their physical health. A systematic search was undertaken using (i) CINAHL, (ii) MEDLINE, (iii) PsycINFO, (iv) Scopus, and (v) Google Scholar between September and December 2021. Sixty-one papers comprising 3828 consumer participants met the inclusion criteria. This review found that consumers provide invaluable insights into the barriers and enablers of physical healthcare and interventions. When consumers are authentically involved in physical healthcare evaluation, constructive and relevant recommendations to improve physical healthcare services, policy, and future research directions are produced. Consumer evaluation is the cornerstone required to successfully implement tailored physical health services.","Consumers of mental health services experience poor physical health compared to the general population, leading to long-term physical illness and premature death.

10.1002/ece3.3426,Phytophagous insect oviposition shifts in response to probability of flower abortion owing to the presence of basal fruits.,"Phytophagous insects use a wide range of indicators or associated cues to avoid laying eggs in sites where offspring survival is low. For insects that lay eggs in flowers, these unsuitable sites may be created by the host plant's resource allocation to flowers. In the sequentially flowering host plant, <i>Yucca glauca</i>, late-opening distal flowers are more likely to be aborted in the presence of already-initiated basal fruits because they are strong resource sinks. If flowers are aborted, all eggs of the phytophagous insect, <i>Tegeticula yuccasella</i>, within the flower die. We used the phytophagous insect <i>T. yuccasella</i> that lays eggs in and pollinates host plant <i>Y. glauca</i> flowers to test the hypothesis that phytophagous insect females are less likely to invest eggs in host plant flowers if basal fruits are present because they are more likely to be aborted. We also investigated potential predictors of arrival of <i>T. yuccasella</i> at inflorescences at the onset of flowering. These factors may influence a phytophagous insect's decisions to select oviposition sites. We carried out a behavioral experiment using wild-caught <i>T. yuccasella</i> females on manipulated inflorescences with distal flowers with basal fruits and without fruits. As potential predictors of <i>T. yuccasella</i> arriving at inflorescences, we used floral display size and day of onset of flowering. In support of our hypothesis, our experimental results showed that <i>T. yuccasella</i> was significantly less likely to oviposit in distal flowers on inflorescences with basal fruits. We also found that <i>T. yuccasella</i> arrival was higher at inflorescences with larger floral display size and earlier in the flowering season. These findings uncover a novel indicator of unsuitable oviposition sites-the presence of basal fruits, that phytophagous insects use to make oviposition decisions. Further, our study contributes to the growing body of evidence that shows that females prefer sites that increase the probability of survival of their offspring.","Phytophagous insects use a wide range of indicators or associated cues to avoid laying eggs in sites where offspring survival is low.

Here, we investigated a tritrophic system, which included the herbivore Heortia vitessoides, its host plant Aquilaria sinensis, and its predator Cantheconidea concinna. Herbivore-damaged A. sinensis plants released significantly greater amounts of volatiles than undamaged and mechanically damaged plants, with an obvious temporal trend. One day after initial herbivore damage, A. sinensis plants released large amounts of volatile compounds. Volatile compounds release gradually decreased over the next 3 d. The composition and relative concentrations of the electroantennographic detection (EAD)-active compounds, emitted after herbivore damage, varied significantly over the 4-d measurement period. In wind tunnel bioassays, mated H. vitessoides females showed a preference for undamaged plants over herbivore and mechanically damaged A. sinensis plants. In Y-tube bioassays, C. concinna preferred odours from herbivore-damaged plants to those from undamaged plants, especially after the early stages of insect attack. Our results indicate that the herbivore-induced compounds produced in response to attack by H. vitessoides larvae on A. sinensis plants could be used by both the herbivores themselves and their natural enemies to locate suitable host plants and prey, respectively.","The effects of induced plant responses on herbivores are categorised as direct, by reducing herbivore development, or indirect, by affecting the performance of natural enemies.

10.1128/mbio.02383-17,The Viscoelastic Properties of the Fungal Cell Wall Allow Traffic of AmBisome as Intact Liposome Vesicles.,"The fungal cell wall is a critically important structure that represents a permeability barrier and protective shield. We probed <i>Candida albicans</i> and <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> with liposomes containing amphotericin B (AmBisome), with or without 15-nm colloidal gold particles. The liposomes have a diameter of 60 to 80 nm, and yet their mode of action requires them to penetrate the fungal cell wall to deliver amphotericin B to the cell membrane, where it binds to ergosterol. Surprisingly, using cryofixation techniques with electron microscopy, we observed that the liposomes remained intact during transit through the cell wall of both yeast species, even though the predicted porosity of the cell wall (pore size, ~5.8 nm) is theoretically too small to allow these liposomes to pass through intact. <i>C. albicans</i> mutants with altered cell wall thickness and composition were similar in both their <i>in vitro</i> AmBisome susceptibility and the ability of liposomes to penetrate the cell wall. AmBisome exposed to ergosterol-deficient <i>C. albicans</i> failed to penetrate beyond the mannoprotein-rich outer cell wall layer. Melanization of <i>C. neoformans</i> and the absence of amphotericin B in the liposomes were also associated with a significant reduction in liposome penetration. Therefore, AmBisome can reach cell membranes intact, implying that fungal cell wall viscoelastic properties are permissive to vesicular structures. The fact that AmBisome can transit through chemically diverse cell wall matrices when these liposomes are larger than the theoretical cell wall porosity suggests that the wall is capable of rapid remodeling, which may also be the mechanism for release of extracellular vesicles.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> AmBisome is a broad-spectrum fungicidal antifungal agent in which the hydrophobic polyene antibiotic amphotericin B is packaged within a 60- to 80-nm liposome. The mode of action involves perturbation of the fungal cell membrane by selectively binding to ergosterol, thereby disrupting membrane function. We report that the AmBisome liposome transits through the cell walls of both <i>Candida albicans</i> and <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> intact, despite the fact that the liposome is larger than the theoretical cell wall porosity. This implies that the cell wall has deformable, viscoelastic properties that are permissive to transwall vesicular traffic. These observations help explain the low toxicity of AmBisome, which can deliver its payload directly to the cell membrane without unloading the polyene in the cell wall. In addition, these findings suggest that extracellular vesicles may also be able to pass through the cell wall to deliver soluble and membrane-bound effectors and other molecules to the extracellular space.","The fungal cell wall is a critically important structure that represents a permeability barrier and protective shield.

10.1038/ncomms15458,Two forms of death in ageing Caenorhabditis elegans.,"Ageing generates senescent pathologies, some of which cause death. Interventions that delay or prevent lethal pathologies will extend lifespan. Here we identify life-limiting pathologies in Caenorhabditis elegans with a necropsy analysis of worms that have died of old age. Our results imply the presence of multiple causes of death. Specifically, we identify two classes of corpse: early deaths with a swollen pharynx (which we call 'P deaths'), and later deaths with an atrophied pharynx (termed 'p deaths'). The effects of interventions on lifespan can be broken down into changes in the frequency and/or timing of either form of death. For example, glp-1 mutation only delays p death, while eat-2 mutation reduces P death. Combining pathology and mortality analysis allows mortality profiles to be deconvolved, providing biological meaning to complex survival and mortality profiles.","Ageing generates senescent pathologies, some of which cause death.

There are both peripheral and brain region-specific maladaptations of the immune response to chronic stress that produce interrelated mechanistic considerations required for the design of novel therapeutic strategies for prevention of stress-induced psychological impairment. This study shows that a combination of probiotics and polyphenol-rich prebiotics, a synbiotic, attenuates the chronic-stress induced inflammatory responses in the ileum and the prefrontal cortex promoting resilience to the consequent depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in male mice. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that this effect may be attributed to specific synbiotic-produced metabolites including 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and caffeic acid. Using a model of chronic unpredictable stress, behavioral abnormalities were associated to strong immune cell activation and recruitment in the ileum while inflammasome pathways were implicated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Chronic stress also upregulated the ratio of activated proinflammatory T helper 17 (Th17) to regulatory T cells (Treg) in the liver and ileum and it was predicted with ingenuity pathway analysis that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) could be driving the synbiotic's effect on the ileum's inflammatory response to stress. Synbiotic treatment indiscriminately attenuated the stress-induced immune and behavioral aberrations in both the ileum and the brain while in a gut-immune co-culture model, the synbiotic-specific metabolites promoted anti-inflammatory activity through the AHR. Overall, this study characterizes a novel synbiotic treatment for chronic-stress induced behavioral impairments while defining a putative mechanism of gut-microbiota host interaction for modulating the peripheral and brain immune systems.","Chronic stress disrupts immune homeostasis while gut microbiota-derived metabolites attenuate inflammation, thus promoting resilience to stress-induced immune and behavioral abnormalities.

Many wood-decaying fungi are capable of degrading the wood component lignin by segregated lignases. These fungi are responsible for severe financial damage in agriculture, and many of these plant diseases cannot be treated today. However, enzymatic degradation is also an attractive handle to achieve a controlled release of drugs from artificial lignin vehicles. Herein, chemically cross-linked lignin nanocarriers (NCs) were prepared by aza-Michael addition in miniemulsion, followed by solvent evaporation. The cross-linking of lignin was achieved with the bio-based amines (spermine and spermidine). Several fungicides-namely, azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, tebuconazole, and boscalid-were encapsulated in situ during the miniemulsion polymerization, demonstrating the versatility of the method. Lignin NCs with diameters of 200-300 nm (determined by dynamic light scattering) were obtained, with high encapsulation efficiencies (70-99%, depending on the drug solubility). Lignin NCs successfully inhibited the growth of <i>Phaeomoniella chlamydospora</i> and <i>Phaeoacremonium minimum</i>, which are lignase-producing fungi associated with the worldwide occurring fungal grapevine trunk disease Esca. <i>In planta</i> studies proved their efficiency for at least 4 years after a single injection into <i>Vitis vinifera</i> (""Portugieser"") plants on a test vineyard in Germany.

This contributes to the indiscriminate use of antimicrobial drugs and poor treatment outcomes. The aim of this comprehensive review was to summarize the diagnostic performance of host biomarkers capable of differentiating bacterial from non-bacterial infections to guide the use of antibiotics.<h4>Methods</h4>Online databases of published literature were searched from January 2010 through April 2015. English language studies that evaluated the performance of one or more host biomarker in differentiating bacterial from non-bacterial infection in patients were included. Key information extracted included author information, study methods, population, pathogens, clinical information, and biomarker performance data. Study quality was assessed using a combination of validated criteria from the QUADAS and Lijmer checklists. Biomarkers were categorized as hematologic factors, inflammatory molecules, cytokines, cell surface or metabolic markers, other host biomarkers, host transcripts, clinical biometrics, and combinations of markers.<h4>Findings</h4>Of the 193 citations identified, 59 studies that evaluated over 112 host biomarkers were selected. Most studies involved patient populations from high-income countries, while 19% involved populations from low- and middle-income countries. The most frequently evaluated host biomarkers were C-reactive protein (61%), white blood cell count (44%) and procalcitonin (34%). Study quality scores ranged from 23.1% to 92.3%. There were 9 high performance host biomarkers or combinations, with sensitivity and specificity of ≥85% or either sensitivity or specificity was reported to be 100%. Five host biomarkers were considered weak markers as they lacked statistically significant performance in discriminating between bacterial and non-bacterial infections.<h4>Discussion</h4>This manuscript provides a summary of host biomarkers to differentiate bacterial from non-bacterial infections in patients with acute febrile illness. Findings provide a basis for prioritizing efforts for further research, assay development and eventual commercialization of rapid point-of-care tests to guide use of antimicrobials. This review also highlights gaps in current knowledge that should be addressed to further improve management of febrile patients.","<h4>Background</h4>In resource limited settings acute febrile illnesses are often treated empirically due to a lack of reliable, rapid point-of-care diagnostics.

Progress in tagging, mapping and cloning of several resistance (R) genes against aforesaid stresses has led to marker assisted multigene introgression into elite cultivars for multiple and durable resistance. However, no detailed study has been made on possible interactions among these genes when expressed simultaneously under combined stresses.<h4>Results</h4>Our studies monitored expression profiles of 14 defense related genes in 11 rice breeding lines derived from an elite cultivar with different combination of R genes against BB, BL and GM under single and multiple challenge. Four of the genes found implicated earlier under combined GM and BB stress were confirmed to be induced (≥ 2 fold) in stem tissue following GM infestation; while one of these, cytochrome P450 family protein, was also induced in leaf in plants challenged by either BB or BL but not together. Three of the genes highlighted earlier in plants challenged by both BB and BL were also found induced in stem under GM challenge. Pi54 the target R gene against BL was also found induced when challenged by GM. Though expression of some genes was noted to be inhibited under combined pest challenge, such effects did not result in compromise in resistance against any of the target pests.<h4>Conclusion</h4>While R genes generally tended to respond to specific pest challenge, several of the downstream defense genes responded to multiple pest challenge either single, sequential or simultaneous, without any distinct antagonism in expression of resistance to the target pests in two of the pyramided lines RPNF05 and RPNF08.","<h4>Background</h4>Rice, a major food crop of the world, endures many major biotic stresses like bacterial blight (BB), fungal blast (BL) and the insect Asian rice gall midge (GM) that cause significant yield losses.

10.3390/biom10010161,The Plant-Derived Compound Resveratrol in Brain Cancer: A Review.,"Despite intensive research, malignant brain tumors are among the most difficult to treat due to high resistance to conventional therapeutic approaches. High-grade malignant gliomas, including glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma, are among the most devastating and rapidly growing cancers. Despite the ability of standard treatment agents to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the brain, malignant gliomas are often resistant to alkylating agents. Resveratrol is a plant polyphenol occurring in nuts, berries, grapes, and red wine. Resveratrol crosses the blood‒brain barrier and may influence the central nervous system. Moreover, it influences the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase and, more importantly, the resistance to standard treatment via various mechanisms, such as O6-methylguanine methyltransferase. This review summarizes the anticancer effects of resveratrol in various types of brain cancer. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have presented promising results; however, further clinical research is necessary to prove the therapeutic efficacy of resveratrol in brain cancer treatment.","Despite intensive research, malignant brain tumors are among the most difficult to treat due to high resistance to conventional therapeutic approaches.

Antimicrobial proteins and peptides (APPs) are key effectors that function as broad-spectrum anti-infectives. This review seeks to summarize the clinically relevant functional qualities of APPs and the increasing clinical trial evidence for their use to combat serious infections in infancy. Levels of APPs are relatively low in early life, especially in infants born preterm or with low birth weight (LBW). There are several rationales for the potential clinical utility of APPs in the prevention and treatment of infections in infants: (a) APPs may be most helpful in those with reduced levels; (b) during sepsis microbial products signal via pattern recognition receptors causing potentially harmful inflammation that APPs may counteract; and (c) in the era of antibiotic resistance, development of new anti-infective strategies is essential. Evidence supports the potential clinical utility of exogenous APPs to reduce infection-related morbidity in infancy. Further studies should characterize the ontogeny of antimicrobial activity in mucosal and systemic compartments, and examine the efficacy of exogenous-APP formulations to inform translational development of APPs for infant groups.","While developing adaptive immune responses, young infants are especially vulnerable to serious infections, including sepsis, meningitis, and pneumonia.

Aflatoxins can be found at dangerously high levels and can readily contaminate pre-harvest maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) grain. Sources of resistance to aflatoxin accumulation in maize have been identified, however, the highly quantitative nature and complex inheritance of this trait have limited the introgression of aflatoxin accumulation resistance into agronomically desirable lines. Mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) was performed on a bi-parental population comprised of 241 F2:3 families derived from the cross of inbred lines Mp705 (susceptible) × Mp719 (resistant). The mapping population was phenotyped in replicated field trials in three environments for resistance to aflatoxin accumulation under artificial inoculation with an <i>A. flavus</i> spore suspension. The genetic linkage map was constructed with 1,276 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers covering a total genetic distance of 1,642 cM across all ten maize chromosomes. Multiple interval mapping revealed that majority of the aflatoxin-reducing alleles and the source for the larger effect QTL identified in this study were contributed from Mp719, the resistant parent. Two QTL identified on chromosome 1 (bin 1.06-1.07) and chromosome 3 (bin 3.09) were the most stable across different environments and when combined, explained 24.6% of the total phenotypic variance across all three environments. Results from the study showed that these chromosomal regions harbor important QTL for influencing aflatoxin accumulation, which is consistent with previous reports with other different mapping populations. These stable QTL were the most promising for controlling aflatoxin accumulation in maize grain. Identifying beneficial alleles derived from Mp719 and closely linked molecular markers through QTL analysis for implementation of MAS could accelerate breeding efforts to reduce aflatoxin accumulation in maize.","Aflatoxins are carcinogenic and toxic compounds produced principally by fungal species <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> (Link: Fries) and <i>A. parasiticus</i> (Speare), which are common contaminants of food and feed.

The purpose of this study was to clarify the <i>in vivo</i> antifungal activity of perillaldehyde (PAE) against <i>C. albicans</i> and to prove that PAE is a promising candidate for the control of vaginal candidiasis. An animal model of vaginitis was developed to demonstrate the therapeutic and preventive effects of PAE on vaginal candidiasis, and these were evaluated through fungal and histopathological examinations. In clarifying the mechanism of PAE, standard hematological test results indicated that white blood cells (WBC) were elevated abnormally in mice infected with <i>C. albicans</i>, whereas when the mice were treated with various concentrations of PAE, the number of WBC in the blood was reduced. Flow cytometry was used to detect the populations of neutrophils, macrophages and CD4 T cells in the vaginal tissue of the mice. PAE was found to reduce these immune cells, which all play a key role in the inflammatory response, and the related interleukin and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-17, IL-22 and TNF-α. These were detected using ELISA. Finally, we detected the expression levels of E-cadherin in the PAE treatment mouse group and discovered that it had recovered to its normal levels, but in the infection mouse group, the E-cadherin expression was clearly suppressed by the presence of <i>C. albicans</i>. Our data demonstrated that PAE targets these cytokines and possesses the ability to fight the fungal infection while also reducing the levels of the inflammatory factors identified.

More than 31,000 fruit-bearing lychee trees also exist in private backyards, making this an issue pertinent to a wide cross-section of the Mauritian general public and not just those involved in commercial fruit production. The level of damage caused by bats to fruit crops is often debated and the low number of robust damage assessment studies hampers mitigation efforts. During the fruiting season of 2016/2017, we assessed the damage among backyard lychee trees attributable to fruit bats and other causes around Vacoas-Phoenix, Central Mauritius and evaluated the impact of using protective netting as a mitigation strategy. Fruit yield from panicles that were protected from depredation by nylon netting was approximately one third greater than that from unprotected panicles. We suspect that fruit bats were responsible for approximately 42% of the total damage but illustrate the difficulties in attributing damage to a single cause in such assessments. Although we demonstrate the value of protective netting, we recognize that barriers to implementation exist and that a more holistic approach that incorporates crop protection, forest restoration strategies and addresses negative public attitudes towards bats in general is required to ensure the persistence of this endemic species.","The Mauritius fruit bat (Pteropus niger) has been the subject of repeated culling campaigns, apparently in response to pressure from the fruit-growing industry concerned over damage to commercially valuable orchard crops such as lychees.

10.1111/pbi.13394,Loss of function of CRT1a (calreticulin) reduces plant susceptibility to Verticillium longisporum in both Arabidopsis thaliana and oilseed rape (Brassica napus).,"Brassica napus is highly susceptible towards Verticillium longisporum (Vl43) with no effective genetic resistance. It is believed that the fungus reprogrammes plant physiological processes by up-regulation of so-called susceptibility factors to establish a compatible interaction. By transcriptome analysis, we identified genes, which were activated/up-regulated in rapeseed after Vl43 infection. To test whether one of these genes is functionally involved in the infection process and loss of function would lead to decreased susceptibility, we firstly challenged KO lines of corresponding Arabidopsis orthologs with Vl43 and compared them with wild-type plants. Here, we report that the KO of AtCRT1a results in drastically reduced susceptibility of plants to Vl43. To prove crt1a mutation also decreases susceptibility in B. napus, we identified 10 mutations in a TILLING population. Three T3 mutants displayed increased resistance as compared to the wild type. To validate the results, we generated CRISPR/Cas-induced BnCRT1a mutants, challenged T2 plants with Vl43 and observed an overall reduced susceptibility in 3 out of 4 independent lines. Genotyping by allele-specific sequencing suggests a major effect of mutations in the CRT1a A-genome copy, while the C-genome copy appears to have no significant impact on plant susceptibility when challenged with Vl43. As revealed by transcript analysis, the loss of function of CRT1a results in activation of the ethylene signalling pathway, which may contribute to reduced susceptibility.

10.1038/emi.2016.116,Application of a low molecular weight antifungal protein from Penicillium chrysogenum (PAF) to treat pulmonary aspergillosis in mice.,"PAF, a small antifungal protein from Penicillium chrysogenum, inhibits the growth of several pathogenic filamentous fungi, including members of the Aspergillus genus. PAF has been proven to have no toxic effects in vivo in mice by intranasal application. To test its efficacy against invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), experiments were carried out in mice suffering from IPA. Adult mice were immunosuppressed and then infected with Aspergillus fumigatus. After stable infection, the animals were inoculated with PAF intranasally at a concentration of 2.7 mg/kg twice per day. At this concentration-which is highly toxic in vitro to A. fumigatus-the mortality of the animals was slightly delayed but finally all animals died. Histological examinations revealed massive fungal infections in the lungs of both PAF-treated and untreated animal groups. Because intranasally administered PAF was unable to overcome IPA, modified and combined therapies were introduced. The intraperitoneal application of PAF in animals with IPA prolonged the survival of the animals only 1 day. Similar results were obtained with amphotericin B (AMB), with PAF and AMB being equally effective. Combined therapy with AMB and PAF-which are synergistic in vitro-was found to be more effective than either AMB or PAF treatment alone. As no toxic effects of PAF in mammals have been described thus far, and, moreover, there are so far no A. fumigatus strains with reported inherent or acquired PAF resistance, it is worth carrying out further studies to introduce PAF as a potential antifungal drug in human therapy.","PAF, a small antifungal protein from Penicillium chrysogenum, inhibits the growth of several pathogenic filamentous fungi, including members of the Aspergillus genus.

10.3389/fphar.2018.00672,Advancements in Regenerative Strategies Through the Continuum of Burn Care.,"Burns are caused by several mechanisms including flame, scald, chemical, electrical, and ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. Approximately half a million burn cases are registered annually, of which 40 thousand patients are hospitalized and receive definitive treatment. Burn care is very resource intensive as the treatment regimens and length of hospitalization are substantial. Burn wounds are classified based on depth as superficial (first degree), partial-thickness (second degree), or full-thickness (third degree), which determines the treatment necessary for successful healing. The goal of burn wound care is to fully restore the barrier function of the tissue as quickly as possible while minimizing infection, scarring, and contracture. The aim of this review is to highlight how tissue engineering and regenerative medicine strategies are being used to address the unique challenges of burn wound healing and define the current gaps in care for both partial- and full-thickness burn injuries. This review will present the current standard of care (SOC) and provide information on various treatment options that have been tested pre-clinically or are currently in clinical trials. Due to the complexity of burn wound healing compared to other skin injuries, burn specific treatment regimens must be developed. Recently, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine strategies have been developed to improve skin regeneration that can restore normal skin physiology and limit adverse outcomes, such as infection, delayed re-epithelialization, and scarring. Our emphasis will be centered on how current clinical and pre-clinical research of pharmacological agents, biomaterials, and cellular-based therapies can be applied throughout the continuum of burn care by targeting the stages of wound healing: hemostasis, inflammation, cell proliferation, and matrix remodeling.","Burns are caused by several mechanisms including flame, scald, chemical, electrical, and ionizing and non-ionizing radiation.

For effective synthesis, there must be consistency in outcome reporting. There is no agreed set of outcomes for reporting the effect of burn care interventions. Issues with outcome reporting have been identified, although not systematically investigated. This study gathers empirical evidence on any variation in outcome reporting and assesses the need for a core outcome set for burn care research.<h4>Methods</h4>Electronic searches of four search engines were undertaken from January 2012 to December 2016 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), using medical subject headings and free text terms including 'burn', 'scald' 'thermal injury' and 'RCT'. Two authors independently screened papers, extracted outcomes verbatim and recorded the timing of outcome measurement. Duplicate outcomes (exact wording ± different spelling), similar outcomes (albumin in blood, serum albumin) and identical outcomes measured at different times were removed. Variation in outcome reporting was determined by assessing the number of unique outcomes reported across all included trials. Outcomes were classified into domains. Bias was reduced using five researchers and a patient working independently and together.<h4>Results</h4>147 trials were included, of which 127 (86.4%) were RCTs, 13 (8.8%) pilot studies and 7 (4.8%) RCT protocols. 1494 verbatim clinical outcomes were reported; 955 were unique. 76.8% of outcomes were measured within 6 months of injury. Commonly reported outcomes were defined differently. Numbers of unique outcomes per trial varied from one to 37 (median 9; IQR 5,13). No single outcome was reported across all studies demonstrating inconsistency of reporting. Outcomes were classified into 54 domains. Numbers of outcomes per domain ranged from 1 to 166 (median 11; IQR 3,24).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This review has demonstrated heterogeneity in outcome reporting in burn care research which will hinder amalgamation of study data. We recommend the development of a Core Outcome Set.<h4>Prospero registration number</h4>CRD42017060908.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Systematic reviews collate trial data to provide evidence to support clinical decision-making.

We investigated the effect of leaf litter diversity and identity on microbial functions and the abundance of microarthropods in Ecuadorian tropical montane rainforests. We used litterbags filled with leaves of six native tree species (<i>Cecropia andina</i>, <i>Dictyocaryum lamarckianum</i>, <i>Myrcia pubescens</i>, <i>Cavendishia zamorensis</i>, <i>Graffenrieda emarginata</i>, and <i>Clusia</i> spp.) and incubated monocultures and all possible two- and four-species combinations in the field for 6 and 12 months. Mass loss, microbial biomass, basal respiration, metabolic quotient, and the slope of microbial growth after glucose addition, as well as the abundance of microarthropods (Acari and Collembola), were measured at both sampling dates. Leaf litter diversity significantly increased mass loss after 6 months of exposure, but reduced microbial biomass after 12 months of exposure. Leaf litter species identity significantly changed both microbial activity and microarthropod abundance with species of high quality (low C-to-N ratio), such as <i>C. andina</i>, improving resource quality as indicated by lower metabolic quotient and higher abundance of microarthropods. Nonetheless, species of low quality, such as <i>Clusia</i> spp., also increased the abundance of Oribatida suggesting that leaf litter chemical composition alone is insufficient to explain variation in the abundances of soil microarthropods. Overall, the results provide evidence that decomposition and microbial biomass in litter respond to leaf litter diversity as well as litter identity (chemical and physical characteristics), while microarthropods respond only to litter identity but not litter diversity.","In tropical forest ecosystems leaf litter from a large variety of species enters the decomposer system, however, the impact of leaf litter diversity on the abundance and activity of soil organisms during decomposition is little known.

10.1038/s41598-018-30754-6,An Adult Zebrafish Model Reveals that Mucormycosis Induces Apoptosis of Infected Macrophages.,"Mucormycosis is a life-threatening fungal infection caused by various ubiquitous filamentous fungi of the Mucorales order, although Rhizopus spp. and Mucor spp. are the most prevalent causal agents. The limited therapeutic options available together with a rapid progression of the infection and a difficult early diagnosis produce high mortality. Here, we developed an adult zebrafish model of Mucor circinelloides infection which allowed us to confirm the link between sporangiospore size and virulence. Transcriptomic studies revealed a local, strong inflammatory response of the host elicited after sporangiospore germination and mycelial tissue invasion, while avirulent and UV-killed sporangiospores failed to induce inflammation and were rapidly cleared. Of the 857 genes modulated by the infection, those encoding cytokines, complement factors, peptidoglycan recognition proteins, and iron acquisition are particularly interesting. Furthermore, neutrophils and macrophages were similarly recruited independently of sporangiospore virulence and viability, which results in a robust depletion of both cell types in the hematopoietic compartment. Strikingly, our model also reveals for the first time the ability of mucormycosis to induce the apoptosis of recruited macrophages but not neutrophils. The induction of macrophage apoptosis, therefore, might represent a key virulence mechanism of these fungal pathogens, providing novel targets for therapeutic intervention in this lethal infection.","Mucormycosis is a life-threatening fungal infection caused by various ubiquitous filamentous fungi of the Mucorales order, although Rhizopus spp. and Mucor spp. are the most prevalent causal agents.

,Experience with β-d-Glucan Assay for Diagnosis of Invasive Candidiasis in ICU Patients: Pilot Study from India,"Abstract <h4>Background</h4> β-d-Glucan assay (BDG) has been recently introduced in India and is recommended for the early diagnosis of invasive candidiasis (IC), but there are a number of factors (eg β-lactam antibiotics, immunoglobulin and albumin infusions, bacteremia and surgical mesh) which may falsely elevate BDG levels. <h4>Methods</h4> This was a retrospective, observational study done in the 23 bedded multi-disciplinary ICU of a tertiary care hospital in South India. Case records of adult (> 18 years) non-neutropenic patients having severe sepsis or shock with ≥ 1 risk factor for IC were analyzed. As a standard practice, BDG assay was sent and effective antifungals were started on the day of suspicion of IC. All neutropenic, immunocompromised patients, those already on antifungal and those who were diagnosed with other invasive fungal infections were excluded from the study. FDA approved Fungitell assay was used to measure serum BDG levels (pg/mL). <h4>Results</h4> Patients were divided into 3 groups. Group A (n = 16) comprised of patients in whom diagnosis of IC was confirmed (blood culture or another sterile site grew candida). Group B (n = 30) comprised of patients in whom alternative diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock was found or they did not improve after administration of antifungals. Group C (n = 31) comprised of those patients in whom neither diagnosis of IC was confirmed nor an alternative explanation was found but they improved clinically on giving antifungal therapy. Mean BDG levels was significantly higher in Group A as compared with Group B and Group C (448.75 ± 88.30 vs 144.46 ± 82.49 vs 292.90 ± 137.0 pg/mL; P < 0.001). The mean value of the BDG was higher than the accepted cutoff of 80 pg/mL in all three groups (Figure 1). The use of agents which cause false elevation of BDG was significantly higher in Group B as compared with Group A (P = 0.02). <h4>Conclusion</h4> A BDG assay cutoff of 80 pg/mL leads to a higher number of false positive results in ICU patients, where false positive factors are unavoidable. The results of this study suggest that a higher cutoff of at least 144 pg/mL will be more specific for IC, although this may need further validation with larger trials.Figure 1: Mean BDG values in various groups <h4>Disclosures</h4> All authors: No reported disclosures.","Abstract <h4>Background</h4> β-d-Glucan assay (BDG) has been recently introduced in India and is recommended for the early diagnosis of invasive candidiasis (IC), but there are a number of factors (eg β-lactam antibiotics, immunoglobulin and albumin infusions, bacteremia and surgical mesh) which may falsely elevate BDG levels. <h4>Methods</h4> This was a retrospective, observational study done in the 23 bedded multi-disciplinary ICU of a tertiary care hospital in South India.

In addition, the expression levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)/retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma (RORγt)/interleukin (IL)-17A signaling pathway, which is involved in the regulation of Th17 cells, as well as whether there are differences between two types of IPA mice models, remain unknown.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Six to eight weeks old female BALB/c mice were treated with cortisone acetate or cyclophosphamide to establish the immunosuppressive mice models, and then, <i>A. fumigatus</i> inoculum was injected to form the IPA groups and sterile saline was injected to form the control groups. Flow cytometry was performed to measure the proportion of Th17 cells in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the peripheral blood, spleen, and lung of the mice.

10.1093/ee/nvw067,"Host Selection, Growth, and Survival of Melonworm (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) on Four Cucurbit Crops Under Laboratory Conditions.","The melonworm, Diaphania hyalinata L. (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is one of the most serious insect problems affecting cucurbit production. We evaluated the relative preference and suitability of yellow squash, zucchini, cucumber, and watermelon to melonworm by measuring its oviposition, larval feeding preference, survivorship, and developmental responses in the laboratory. Whole plants were used for oviposition study, whereas host leaf discs were used for all the other studies. Watermelon feeding resulted in the longest larval development period (14.3 d), greatest prepupal weights and survivals rates (92%; first instar to adult) among the four crops. However, for watermelon, adult oviposition preference (199.5 eggs/♀), egg survival (70%), and larval feeding (4.1% defoliation) were numerically or statistically lowest, and larval head capsule widths and whole-body lengths were smallest. When differences occurred among these variables, yellow squash, zucchini, and cucumber were each typically higher (or quicker to develop) than watermelon. So why do melonworm adults not prefer watermelon, or at least select it as frequently as squash and cucumber when ovipositing? The answer likely is that there might be some variation in the important chemical components among these cucurbits. We suggest that comparison of kairomones and allomones from watermelon and related cucurbits would be very useful for determining the combination resulting in the lowest risk of damage to the more susceptible cucurbits (assuming the levels can be modified without seriously affecting the crops).","The melonworm, Diaphania hyalinata L.

ADP binds to retinoic acid nuclear receptors. The comedolytic, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory are the known ADP effects. Its safety profile is an advantage over other retinoids. ADP recently was found to be effective in the treatment of several dermatological diseases and photoaging besides the utility in the treatment of acne vulgaris. New biological effects of adapalene with therapeutic potential are highlighted in this review paper. Thus, adapalene could be a valuable therapeutic drug into the treatment of several types of cancer. Additionally, some neurodegenerative diseases could be treated with a suitable formulation for intravenous administration. The antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> of an analogue of ADP has been proven. In different therapeutic schemes, ADP is more effective in combination with other active substances. New topical combinations with adapalene include ketoconazole (antifungal), mometasone furoate (anti-inflammatory corticosteroid), nadifloxacin (fluoroquinolone), and alfa and beta hydroxy acids. Combination with oral drugs is a new trend that enhances the properties of topical formulations with adapalene. Several studies have investigated the effects of ADP in co-administration with azithromycin, doxycycline, faropenem, isotretinoin, and valganciclovir. Innovative formulations of ADP also aim to achieve a better bioavailability, increased efficacy, and reduced side effects. In this review, we have highlighted the current studies on adapalene regarding biological effects useful in various treatment types.

10.1002/ece3.6719,Short-term decline of <i>Castanopsis fargesii</i> adult trees promotes conspecific seedling regeneration: The complete process from seed production to seedling establishment.,"Declining forests usually face uncertain regeneration dynamics and recovery trajectories, which are challenging to forest management. In this study, we investigated the decline pattern of <i>Castanopsis fargesii</i> and examined the effects on conspecific seedling regeneration. We found that 61.45% of adult individuals were in decline and the smaller DBH size classes of trees (10-40 cm) had a greater probability of decline. Most of the intermediate decline (94.52%) and nondecline individuals (95.23%) did not worsen, and the crowns of 21.91% of the intermediate decline trees were recovered during 2013-2018. Adult tree decline had a negative effect on seed production (mean mature seed density of nondecline, intermediate decline, and high decline individuals was 167.3, 63.3, and 2.1 seeds/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively), but no effect on key seed traits. The seed survival rate of declining trees was greater than that of nondeclining trees at both the seed production and seed dispersal stages. The seed to seedling transition rates in canopy gaps, decline habitats, and nondecline habitats were 7.94%, 9.47%, and 109.24%, respectively. The survival rate and height growth of newly germinated seedlings were positively correlated with the light condition, which was notably accelerated in the canopy gaps. Taken together, these results indicate that the reduction in seed production of some adult trees had a weakly negative effect on new seedling recruitment, while the improved environmental condition after the decline significantly enhanced the survival and growth of both advanced and new germinated seedlings. Looking at the overall life history, the short-term defoliation and mortality of some <i>C. fargesii</i> adult trees can be regarded as a natural forest disturbance that favors conspecific seedling regeneration. High-intensity management measures would be unnecessary in cases of an emerging intermediate decline in this forest.","Declining forests usually face uncertain regeneration dynamics and recovery trajectories, which are challenging to forest management.

10.3389/fpls.2014.00799,Do soil microbes and abrasion by soil particles influence persistence and loss of physical dormancy in seeds of tropical pioneers?,"Germination from the soil seed bank (SSB) is an important determinant of species composition in tropical forest gaps, with seed persistence in the SSB allowing trees to recruit even decades after dispersal. The capacity to form a persistent SSB is often associated with physical dormancy, where seed coats are impermeable at the time of dispersal. Germination literature often speculates, without empirical evidence, that dormancy-break in physically dormant seeds is the result of microbial action and/or abrasion by soil particles. We tested the microbial/soil abrasion hypothesis in four widely distributed neotropical pioneer tree species (Apeiba membranacea, Luehea seemannii, Ochroma pyramidale, and Cochlospermum vitifolium). Seeds were buried in five common gardens in a lowland tropical forest in Panama, and recovered at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after burial. Seed permeability, microbial infection, seed coat thickness, and germination were measured. Parallel experiments compared the germination fraction of fresh and aged seeds without soil contact, and in seeds as a function of seed permeability. Contrary to the microbial/soil abrasion hypothesis the proportion of permeable seeds, and of seeds infected by cultivable microbes, decreased as a function of burial duration. Furthermore, seeds stored in dark and dry conditions for 2 years showed a higher proportion of seed germination than fresh seeds in identical germination conditions. We determined that permeable seeds of A. membranacea and O. pyramidale had cracks in the chalazal area or lacked the chalazal plug, whereas all surfaces of impermeable seeds were intact. Our results are inconsistent with the microbial/soil abrasion hypothesis of dormancy loss and instead suggest the existence of multiple dormancy phenotypes, where a fraction of each seed cohort is dispersed in a permeable state and germinates immediately, while the impermeable seed fraction accounts for the persistent SSB. Thus, we conclude that fluctuations in the soil temperature in the absence of soil abrasion and microbial infection are sufficient to break physical dormancy on seeds of tropical pioneer trees.","Germination from the soil seed bank (SSB) is an important determinant of species composition in tropical forest gaps, with seed persistence in the SSB allowing trees to recruit even decades after dispersal.

Germination was not significantly different in terms of number of seeds germinated or total biomass of germinated seedlings in transgenic and non-transgenic leaf litter. Separately, ectomycorrhizal associations were observed on transgenic and non-transgenic American chestnut roots using field soil inoculum. Root tip colonization was consistently high (>90% colonization) on all plants and not significantly different between any tree types. These observations on mycorrhizal fungi complement previous studies performed on older transgenic lines which expressed oxalate oxidase at lower levels. Along with other environmental impact comparisons, these conclusions provide further evidence that transgenic American chestnuts are not functionally different with regard to ecosystem interactions than non-transgenic American chestnuts.","The American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>) was once an integral part of eastern United States deciduous forests, with many environmental, economic, and social values.

10.1371/journal.ppat.1007073,An unappreciated role for neutrophil-DC hybrids in immunity to invasive fungal infections.,"Neutrophils are classically defined as terminally differentiated, short-lived cells; however, neutrophils can be long-lived with phenotypic plasticity. During inflammation, a subset of neutrophils transdifferentiate into a population called neutrophil-DC hybrids (PMN-DCs) having properties of both neutrophils and dendritic cells. While these cells ubiquitously appear during inflammation, the role of PMN-DCs in disease remains poorly understood. We observed the differentiation of PMN-DCs in pre-clinical murine models of fungal infection: blastomycosis, aspergillosis and candidiasis. Using reporter strains of fungal viability, we found that PMN-DCs associate with fungal cells and kill them more efficiently than undifferentiated canonical neutrophils. During pulmonary blastomycosis, PMN-DCs comprised less than 1% of leukocytes yet contributed up to 15% of the fungal killing. PMN-DCs displayed higher expression of pattern recognition receptors, greater phagocytosis, and heightened production of reactive oxygen species compared to canonical neutrophils. PMN-DCs also displayed prominent NETosis. To further study PMN-DC function, we exploited a granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP) cell line, generated PMN-DCs to over 90% purity, and used them for adoptive transfer and antigen presentation studies. Adoptively transferred PMN-DCs from the GMP line enhanced protection against systemic infection in vivo. PMN-DCs pulsed with antigen activated fungal calnexin-specific transgenic T cells in vitro and in vivo, promoting the production of interferon-γ and interleukin-17 in these CD4+ T cells. Through direct fungal killing and induction of adaptive immunity, PMN-DCs are potent effectors of antifungal immunity and thereby represent innovative cell therapeutic targets in treating life-threatening fungal infections.","Neutrophils are classically defined as terminally differentiated, short-lived cells; however, neutrophils can be long-lived with phenotypic plasticity. During inflammation, a subset of neutrophils transdifferentiate into a population called neutrophil-DC hybrids (PMN-DCs) having properties of both neutrophils and dendritic cells. While these cells ubiquitously appear during inflammation, the role of PMN-DCs in disease remains poorly understood.

10.1007/s10021-016-0026-7,Slowed Biogeochemical Cycling in Sub-arctic Birch Forest Linked to Reduced Mycorrhizal Growth and Community Change after a Defoliation Event.,"Sub-arctic birch forests (<i>Betula pubescens</i> Ehrh. ssp. <i>czerepanovii</i>) periodically suffer large-scale defoliation events caused by the caterpillars of the geometrid moths <i>Epirrita autumnata</i> and <i>Operophtera brumata</i>. Despite their obvious influence on ecosystem primary productivity, little is known about how the associated reduction in belowground C allocation affects soil processes. We quantified the soil response following a natural defoliation event in sub-arctic Sweden by measuring soil respiration, nitrogen availability and ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) hyphal production and root tip community composition. There was a reduction in soil respiration and an accumulation of soil inorganic N in defoliated plots, symptomatic of a slowdown of soil processes. This coincided with a reduction of EMF hyphal production and a shift in the EMF community to lower autotrophic C-demanding lineages (for example, /russula-lactarius). We show that microbial and nutrient cycling processes shift to a slower, less C-demanding state in response to canopy defoliation. We speculate that, amongst other factors, a reduction in the potential of EMF biomass to immobilise excess mineral nitrogen resulted in its build-up in the soil. These defoliation events are becoming more geographically widespread with climate warming, and could result in a fundamental shift in sub-arctic ecosystem processes and properties. EMF fungi may be important in mediating the response of soil cycles to defoliation and their role merits further investigation.","Sub-arctic birch forests (<i>Betula pubescens</i> Ehrh. ssp. <i>czerepanovii</i>) periodically suffer large-scale defoliation events caused by the caterpillars of the geometrid moths <i>Epirrita autumnata</i> and <i>Operophtera brumata</i>.

They have been integrated into many sensing platforms and assay formats for the detection of various targets, ranging from small molecules to macromolecular entities such as pathogens and whole cells. Despite the advantages MIPs have over natural receptors in terms of commercialization, the striking success stories of biosensor applications such as the glucose meter or the self-test for pregnancy have not been matched by MIP-based sensor or detection kits yet. In this review, we zoom in on the commercial potential of MIP technology and aim to summarize the latest developments in their commercialization and integration into sensors and assays with high commercial potential. We will also analyze which bottlenecks are inflicting with commercialization and how recent advances in commercial MIP synthesis could overcome these obstacles in order for MIPs to truly achieve their commercial potential in the near future.","Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have emerged over the past few decades as interesting synthetic alternatives due to their long-term chemical and physical stability and low-cost synthesis procedure.

During 2019, 198 samples of wheat grains were collected from 25 wheat-growing governorates in Egypt to detect and identify seed-borne mycoflora in vitro. Forty-four fungal species belonging to 20 genera were identified. Molecular data for these fungi were analyzed to construct a phylogenetic tree. Occurrence and biodiversity indicators were calculated. Two prevalent pathogens (average incidence > 40%) were <i>Alternaria alternata</i> and <i>Cladosporium</i> spp. <i>Ustilago tritici</i> was present in only seven of the 25 governorates, and less abundant than <i>Tilletia tritici</i>, the causal agent of stinking smut. Sinai governorate recorded the greatest species diversity, while the greatest species richness was in Qena and Sohag governorates. Canonical correspondence analysis of data for 20 fungal genera with temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed or solar radiation revealed that relative humidity was the most influential weather variable. It showed that occurrence and distribution of the 20 genera corresponded well with three out of four Egyptian climatic regions: Mediterranean, semi-arid, and arid. Knowing pathogen occurrence and distribution in Egypt is the first step to developing future disease management strategies to limit yield losses and improve food security. Despite this study being conducted on the wheat-growing areas in Egypt, our findings are useful for other wheat-growing countries that share the same climatic conditions. The correlation between a given fungus and the climatic variables can be useful in other ecosystems.","Surveillance investigations for pathogenic and toxigenic fungi are important to refine our understanding of their epidemiology and help in predicting their outbreaks.

Infants with mutations in genes involved in tissue barrier fitness are predisposed towards inflammatory diseases, but most do not develop or sustain the diseases, suggesting that there exist regulatory immune mechanisms to prevent aberrant inflammation. The absence of one single murine dermal cell type, the innate neonatal-derived IL-17 producing γδ T (Tγδ17) cells, from birth resulted in spontaneous, highly penetrant AD with many of the major hallmarks of human AD. In Tγδ17 cell-deficient mice, basal keratinocyte transcriptome was altered months in advance of AD induction. Tγδ17 cells respond to skin commensal bacteria and the fulminant disease in their absence was driven by skin commensal bacteria dysbiosis. AD in this model was characterized by highly expanded dermal αβ T clonotypes that produce the type three cytokines, IL-17 and IL-22. These results demonstrate that neonatal Tγδ17 cells are innate skin regulatory T cells that are critical for skin homeostasis, and that IL-17 has dual homeostatic and inflammatory function in the skin.","Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a T cell-mediated chronic skin disease and is associated with altered skin barrier integrity.

10.3389/fmicb.2018.02910,Resveratrol-Mediated Attenuation of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> Enterotoxin B-Induced Acute Liver Injury Is Associated With Regulation of microRNA and Induction of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells.,"Resveratrol (RES) is a polyphenolic compound found abundantly in plant products including red grapes, peanuts, and mulberries. Because of potent anti-inflammatory properties of RES, we investigated whether RES can protect from Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-induced acute liver injury in mice. SEB is a potent super antigen that induces robust inflammation and releases inflammatory cytokines that can be fatal. We observed that SEB caused acute liver injury in mice with increases in enzyme aspartate transaminase (AST) levels, and massive infiltration of immune cells into the liver. Treatment with RES (100 mg/kg body weight) attenuated SEB-induced acute liver injury, as indicated by decreased AST levels and cellular infiltration in the liver. Interestingly, RES treatment increased the number of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the liver. RES treatment led to alterations in the microRNA (miR) profile in liver mononuclear cells (MNCs) of mice exposed to SEB, and pathway analysis indicated these miRs targeted many inflammatory pathways. Of these, we identified miR-185, which was down-regulated by RES, to specifically target Colony Stimulating Factor (CSF1) using transfection studies. Moreover, the levels of CSF1 were significantly increased in RES-treated SEB mice. Because CSF1 is critical in MDSC induction, our studies suggest that RES may induce MDSCs by down-regulating miR-185 leading to increase the expression of CSF1. The data presented demonstrate for the first time that RES can effectively attenuates SEB-induced acute liver injury and that this may result from its action on miRs and induction of MDSCs.","Resveratrol (RES) is a polyphenolic compound found abundantly in plant products including red grapes, peanuts, and mulberries.

Fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy of blood offers the potential for precise and contactless in ovo sex determination of the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus f. dom.) eggs already during the fourth incubation day. However, such kind of optical spectroscopy requires a window in the egg shell, is thus invasive to the embryo and leads to decreased hatching rates. Here, we show that near infrared Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy can be performed on perfused extraembryonic vessels while leaving the inner egg shell membrane intact. Sparing the shell membrane makes the measurement minimally invasive, so that the sexing procedure does not affect hatching rates. We analyze the effect of the membrane above the vessels on fluorescence signal intensity and on Raman spectrum of blood, and propose a correction method to compensate for it. After compensation, we attain a correct sexing rate above 90% by applying supervised classification of spectra. Therefore, this approach offers the best premises towards practical deployment in the hatcheries.","In order to provide an alternative to day-old chick culling in the layer hatcheries, a noninvasive method for egg sexing is required at an early stage of incubation before onset of embryo sensitivity.

10.1093/conphys/coz006,An experimental test of energy and electrolyte supplementation as a mitigation strategy for white-nose syndrome.,"Fungi are increasingly recognised as harmful pathogens of wildlife. White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a fungal disease that has killed millions of hibernating bats in North America. High mortality has driven research to identify management strategies for the disease. Increased energy expenditure and fat depletion, as well as fluid loss, hypotonic dehydration and electrolyte depletion appear to be key aspects of WNS pathophysiology. Bats with WNS spend energy too quickly and also lose fluids containing water and electrolytes from lesions on exposed skin surfaces. During periodic arousals, bats often drink water but, in most of the WNS-affected area, food is not available during winter and, therefore, they cannot maintain energy balance or replace lost electrolytes. Therefore, providing a liquid caloric/electrolyte/nutrient supplement could be useful for treating WNS. We studied captive, hibernating little brown bats (<i>Myotis lucifugus</i>) to test whether providing supplemental energy and electrolytes (a 1:1 dilution of unflavoured Pedialyte) to hibernating bats could reduce severity of WNS symptoms and increase survival. Infected bats in the Pedialyte-supplemented group generally avoided the Pedialyte and preferentially drank plain water. We did not observe any differences in survival, arousal frequency or blood chemistry, but bats in the Pedialyte-supplemented group had higher fungal load and more UV fluorescence than the control group that was only provided with water. Supplemental electrolytes would be an attractive management strategy because of their low cost and logistic feasibility but our results suggest this approach would be ineffective. However, it could be useful to conduct preference experiments with multiple dilutions and/or flavours of electrolyte solution. Although they did not prefer Pedialyte in our experiment, bats in the hand readily drink it and electrolyte supplementation remains an important tool for rehabilitation of captive bats recovering from WNS and other causes of dehydration.","Fungi are increasingly recognised as harmful pathogens of wildlife.

The mean concentration of <i>Ifr</i> propagules as colony forming units per gram (CFUs g<sup>-1</sup>) that leached to different depths in the sand profile per treatment drench rate was also determined. Two weeks post-drenching of <i>Ifr</i> treatments, larvae were assessed for percent mortality, size differences, and effect of treatments in reducing feeding damage to the plant root biomass compared to the controls. Topical spray applications caused 13 and 19% mortality in larvae and adults after 7 days compared to none in the control after 14 days, respectively. Adults feeding on a single <i>Ifr</i> treated leaf for 24 h consumed less than the control, and resulted in 100% mortality 35 days post-treatment compared to 33% in the untreated control.

Drench treatments per pot consisted of 100 mL of <i>Ifr</i> suspension (10⁷ blastospores mL<sup>-1</sup>), flushed with 400, 900, or 1400 mL of water compared to 500, 1000, and 1500 mL of water only for controls. The mean concentration of <i>Ifr</i> propagules as colony forming units per gram (CFUs g<sup>-1</sup>) that leached to different depths in the sand profile per treatment drench rate was also determined. Two weeks post-drenching of <i>Ifr</i> treatments, larvae were assessed for percent mortality, size differences, and effect of treatments in reducing feeding damage to the plant root biomass compared to the controls. Topical spray applications caused 13 and 19% mortality in larvae and adults after 7 days compared to none in the control after 14 days, respectively. Adults feeding on a single <i>Ifr</i> treated leaf for 24 h consumed less than the control, and resulted in 100% mortality 35 days post-treatment compared to 33% in the untreated control. Although offered fresh, untreated leaves after 24 h, only adults in the control group consumed them. <i>Ifr</i> CFUs g<sup>-1</sup> were isolated 8.5-10.5 cm below the sand surface for the 1000 and 1500 mL drench rates only, resulting in 2%-4% larval mortality. For all the <i>Ifr</i> drench treatments, no differences were observed in percent larval mortality and size or the effect of treatments in reducing feeding damage to the plant root biomass compared to the controls. These results suggest that the foliar application of <i>Ifr</i> may be an efficient biocontrol strategy for managing adult populations of <i>D. abbreviatus</i>; potential alternative larval management strategies are discussed.",EuropePMC

Currently, our understanding of cryptococcosis episodes in HIV-negative patients during renal dialysis remains scarce and fragmented. Here, we performed an analysis of pooled cases to systemically summarize the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of cryptococcosis among HIV-negative patients with renal dialysis. Using pooled data from our hospital and studies identified in four medical databases, 18 cases were identified and analyzed. The median duration time of renal dialysis for peritoneal renal dialysis and hemodialysis cases was 8 months and 36 months, respectively. Several non-neoformans/gattii species were identified among the renal dialysis recipients with cryptococcosis, particularly Cryptococcus laurentii and Cryptococcus albidus, which share similar clinical manifestations as those caused by C. neoformans and C. gattii. Our analyses suggest that physicians should consider the possibility of the occurrence of cryptococcosis among renal dialysis recipients even when cryptococcal antigen test result is negative. The timely removal of the catheter is crucial for peritoneal dialysis patients with cryptococcosis. In addition, there is a need for optimized antifungal treatment strategy in renal dialysis recipients with cryptococcal infections.","Cryptococcosis is a lethal fungal infection mainly caused by Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species.

Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to detect 21 mycotoxins, including deoxynivalenol (DON) and its plant-conjugated form, deoxynivalenol 3-β-d-glucoside (DON 3-Glc). Except for DON 3-Glc, all mycotoxin concentrations found in grain dust were higher than in grain (<i>p</i> < 0.0030). Pearson correlation coefficients and two-variable regression show a significant (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) linear relationship between the mycotoxin content in grain and that in grain dust with 19 toxins. In only five mycotoxins (DON, OTA, ochratoxin B, citrinin, and enniatin A<sub>1</sub>), more than 82% of the variation in the data is explained by the two-variable regression model.

For example, active penetration of intestinal epithelia by Candida albicans is critical for dissemination from the gut into the bloodstream. However, little is known about how this fungal pathogen copes with resistive forces upon host cell invasion.<h4>Results</h4>In the present study, we have used PDMS micro-fabrication to probe the ability of filamentous C. albicans cells to penetrate and grow invasively in substrates of different stiffness. We show that there is a threshold for penetration that corresponds to a stiffness of ~ 200 kPa and that invasive growth within a stiff substrate is characterized by dramatic filament buckling, along with a stiffness-dependent decrease in extension rate. We observed a striking alteration in cell morphology, i.e., reduced cell compartment length and increased diameter during invasive growth, that is not due to depolarization of active Cdc42, but rather occurs at a substantial distance from the site of growth as a result of mechanical compression.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data reveal that in response to this compression, active Cdc42 levels are increased at the apex, whereas active Rho1 becomes depolarized, similar to that observed in membrane protrusions. Our results show that cell growth and morphology are altered during invasive growth, suggesting stiffness dictates the host cells that C. albicans can penetrate.","<h4>Background</h4>The initial step of a number of human or plant fungal infections requires active penetration of host tissue.

Immunocompromised individuals, including young children, the elderly, and those with immunodeficiency, are especially vulnerable, yet little is known regarding <i>S. pneumoniae-</i>related pathogenesis and protection in immunocompromised hosts. Recently, strong interest has emerged in the gut microbiota's impact on lung diseases, or the ""gut-lung axis."" However, the mechanisms of gut microbiota protection against gut-distal lung diseases like pneumonia remain unclear. We investigated the role of the gut commensal, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), against pneumococcal pneumonia in immunocompetent and immunocompromised mouse models. For the latter, we chose the Rag<sup>-/-</sup> model, with adaptive immune deficiency. Immunocompetent adaptive protection against <i>S. pneumoniae</i> infection is based on antibodies against pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides, prototypical T cell independent-II (TI-II) antigens. Although SFB colonization enhanced TI-II antibodies in C57BL/6 mice, our data suggest that SFB did not further protect these immunocompetent animals. Indeed, basal B cell activity in hosts without SFB is sufficient for essential protection against <i>S. pneumoniae</i>. However, in immunocompromised Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice, we demonstrate a gut-lung axis of communication, as SFB influenced lung protection by regulating innate immunity. Neutrophil resolution is crucial to recovery, since an unchecked neutrophil response causes severe tissue damage. We found no early neutrophil recruitment differences between hosts with or without SFB; however, we observed a significant drop in lung neutrophils in the resolution phase of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> infection, which corresponded with lower CD47 expression, a molecule that inhibits phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, in SFB-colonized Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice. SFB promoted a shift in lung neutrophil phenotype from inflammatory neutrophils expressing high levels of CD18 and low levels of CD62L, to pro-resolution neutrophils with low CD18 and high CD62L. Blocking CD47 in SFB(-) mice increased pro-resolution neutrophils, suggesting CD47 down-regulation may be one neutrophil-modulating mechanism SFB utilizes. The SFB-induced lung neutrophil phenotype remained similar with heat-inactivated <i>S. pneumoniae</i> treatment, indicating these SFB-induced changes in neutrophil phenotype during the resolution phase are not simply secondary to better bacterial clearance in SFB(+) than SFB(-) mice. Together, these data demonstrate that the gut commensal SFB may provide much-needed protection in immunocompromised hosts in part by promoting neutrophil resolution post lung infection.","<i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> causes infection-related mortality worldwide.

Also, the role of CCR5 in CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cell (Treg) homing has recently begun to grab attention. Japanese encephalitis (JE) is defined as severe neuroinflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) following infection with mosquito-borne flavivirus JE virus. However, the potential contribution of CCR5 to JE progression via mediating CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Treg homing has not been investigated.<h4>Methods</h4>Infected wild-type (Ccr5(+/+)) and CCR5-deficient (Ccr5(-/-)) mice were examined daily for mortality and clinical signs, and neuroinflammation in the CNS was evaluated by infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes and cytokine expression. In addition, viral burden, NK- and JEV-specific T cell responses were analyzed. Adoptive transfer of CCR5(+)CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs was used to evaluate the role of Tregs in JE progression.<h4>Results</h4>CCR5 ablation exacerbated JE without altering viral burden in the extraneural and CNS tissues, as manifested by increased CNS infiltration of Ly-6C(hi) monocytes and Ly-6G(hi) granulocytes. Compared to Ccr5(+/+) mice, Ccr5(-/-) mice unexpectedly showed increased responses of IFN-γ(+)NK and CD8(+) T cells in the spleen, but not CD4(+) T cells. More interestingly, CCR5-ablation resulted in a skewed response to IL-17(+)CD4(+) Th17 cells and correspondingly reduced CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs in the spleen and brain, which was closely associated with exacerbated JE. Our results also revealed that adoptive transfer of sorted CCR5(+)CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs into Ccr5(-/-) mice could ameliorate JE progression without apparently altering the viral burden and CNS infiltration of IL-17(+)CD4(+) Th17 cells, myeloid-derived Ly-6C(hi) monocytes and Ly-6G(hi) granulocytes. Instead, adoptive transfer of CCR5(+)CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs into Ccr5(-/-) mice resulted in increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β) in the spleen and brain, and transferred CCR5(+) Tregs were found to produce IL-10.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CCR5 regulates JE progression via governing timely and appropriate CNS infiltration of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs, thereby facilitating host survival. Therefore, this critical and extended role of CCR5 in JE raises possible safety concerns regarding the use of CCR5 antagonists in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals who inhabit regions in which both HIV and flaviviruses, such as JEV and West Nile virus, are endemic.","<h4>Background</h4>CCR5 is a CC chemokine receptor involved in the migration of effector leukocytes including macrophages, NK, and T cells into inflamed tissues.

However, the mechanism of cAMP signaling in plants remains very poorly understood. Here, we employ the engineered activity of soluble adenylate cyclase to induce cellular cAMP elevation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plants and identify 427 cAMP-responsive genes (CRGs) through RNA-seq analysis. Induction of cellular cAMP elevation inhibits seed germination, disturbs phytohormone contents, promotes leaf senescence, impairs ethylene response, and compromises salt stress tolerance and pathogen resistance. A set of 62 transcription factors are among the CRGs, supporting a prominent role of cAMP in transcriptional regulation. The CRGs are significantly overrepresented in the pathways of plant hormone signal transduction, MAPK signaling, and diterpenoid biosynthesis, but they are also implicated in lipid, sugar, K<sup>+</sup>, nitrate signaling, and beyond. Our results provide a basic framework of cAMP signaling for the community to explore. The regulatory roles of cAMP signaling in plant plasticity are discussed.","Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a pivotal signaling molecule existing in almost all living organisms.

Benzoxazinoids are important anti-insect secondary metabolites in maize, whose biosynthetic pathway has been extensively studied. However, yet little is known about how benzoxazinoids are regulated in maize, partly due to lack of mutant resources and recalcitrance to genetic transformation. Transient systems based on mesophyll- or cultured cell-derived protoplasts have been exploited in several plant species and have become a powerful tool for rapid or high-throughput assays of gene functions. Nevertheless, these systems have not been exploited to study the regulation of secondary metabolites.<h4>Results</h4>A protocol for isolation of protoplasts from etiolated maize seedlings and efficient transfection was optimized. Furthermore, a 10-min-run-time and highly sensitive HPLC-MS method was established to rapidly detect and quantify maize benzoxazinoids. Coupling maize protoplast transfection and HPLC-MS, we screened a few genes potentially regulating benzoxazinoid biosynthesis using overexpression or silencing by artificial microRNA technology.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Combining the power of maize protoplast transfection and HPLC-MS analysis, this method allows rapid screening for the regulatory and biosynthetic genes of maize benzoxazinoids in protoplasts, before the candidates are selected for in planta functional analyses. This method can also be applied to study the biosynthesis and regulation of other secondary metabolites in maize and secondary metabolites in other plant species, including those not amenable to transformation.","<h4>Background</h4>Insect herbivory poses a major threat to maize.

In our study, we investigated potential effects of Metarhizium brunneum ART2825 on soil fungi and prokaryota in bulk soil using high-throughput sequencing of ribosomal markers. Different formulations of this strain, and combinations of the fungus with garlic as efficacy-enhancing agent, were tested over 4 months in a pot and a field experiment carried out for biological control of Agriotes spp. in potatoes. A biocontrol effect was observed only in the pot experiment, i.e. the application of FCBK resulted in 77% efficacy. Colony counts combined with genotyping and marker sequence abundance confirmed the successful establishment of the applied strain. Only the formulated applied strain caused small shifts in fungal communities in the pot experiment. Treatment effects were in the same range as the effects caused by barley kernels, the carrier of the FCBK formulation and temporal effects. Garlic treatments and time affected prokaryotic communities. In the field experiment, only spatial differences affected fungal and prokaryotic communities. Our findings suggest that M. brunneum may not adversely affect soil microbial communities.","The release of large quantities of microorganisms to soil for purposes such as pest control or plant growth promotion may affect the indigenous soil microbial communities.

10.1186/s12865-015-0139-3,Dectin-2-dependent host defense in mice infected with serotype 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae.,"<h4>Background</h4>Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major causative bacterial pathogen of community-acquired pneumonia, possesses a thick polysaccharide capsule. Host defense against this bacterium is mediated by activation of innate immune cells that sense bacterial components. Recently, C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) have garnered much attention in elucidating the recognition mechanism of pathogen-derived polysaccharides.<h4>Methods</h4>In the present study, we first compared the clinical course and neutrophil accumulation in the lungs of Dectin-2 knock-out (KO) and wild type (WT) mice. Mice were infected intratracheally with a serotype 3 strain of S. pneumoniae, and S. pneumoniae bacterial engulfment by neutrophils and inflammatory cytokine and anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide-specific IgG levels were evaluated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We also examined the effect of Dectin-2 deficiency on interleukin (IL)-12 production by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs) stimulated with the bacterial components.<h4>Results</h4>S. pneumonia-infected Dectin-2KO mice had a shorter survival time, larger bacterial burden and lower interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in the lungs than WT mice. Although neutrophilic infiltration in the lungs was equivalent between Dectin-2KO mice and WT mice, S. pneumonia engulfment by neutrophils was attenuated in Dectin-2KO mice compared to WT mice. The anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide-specific IgG and IgG3 levels in BALF were lower in Dectin-2KO mice than in WT mice. When BM-DCs were stimulated with S. pneumoniae culture supernatant or its Concanavalin A (ConA)-bound fraction, IL-12 production was abrogated in Dectin-2KO mice compared to WT mice.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrated that Dectin-2 is intimately involved in the host defense against infection with a serotype 3 strain of S. pneumoniae. Dectin-2-dependent IL-12 production may contribute to IFN-γ synthesis and subsequent production of serotype-specific anti-capsular polysaccharide IgG after S. pneumoniae infection, which may promote S. pneumoniae bacterial opsonization for engulfment.","<h4>Background</h4>Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major causative bacterial pathogen of community-acquired pneumonia, possesses a thick polysaccharide capsule.

Here we show that divergence of Lys11 and Nfr5 LysM receptor kinase paralogs of Lotus japonicus has affected their specificity for lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs) decorations, while the innate capacity to recognize and induce a downstream signalling after perception of rhizobial LCOs (Nod factors) was maintained. Regardless of this conserved ability, Lys11 was found neither expressed, nor essential during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, providing an explanation for the determinant role of Nfr5 gene during Lotus-rhizobia interaction. Lys11 was expressed in root cortex cells associated with intraradical colonizing arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Detailed analyses of lys11 single and nfr1nfr5lys11 triple mutants revealed a functional arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, indicating that Lys11 alone, or its possible shared function with the Nod factor receptors is not essential for the presymbiotic phases of AM symbiosis. Hence, both subfunctionalization and specialization appear to have shaped the function of these paralogs where Lys11 acts as an AM-inducible gene, possibly to fine-tune later stages of this interaction.","Functional divergence of paralogs following gene duplication is one of the mechanisms leading to evolution of novel pathways and traits.

Here, a bacterial strain, Sphingomonas S3-4, that has the ability to degrade the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) was isolated from wheat fields. Incubation of Fusarium-infected wheat grains with S3-4 completely eliminated DON. In S3-4 DON is catabolized into compounds with no detectable phytotoxicity, 3-oxo-DON and 3-epi-DON, via two sequential reactions. Comparative analysis of genome sequences from two DON-degrading strains, S3-4 and Devosia D17, and one non-DON-degrading strain, Sphingobium S26, combined with functional screening of a S3-4 genomic BAC library led to the discovery that a novel aldo/keto reductase superfamily member, AKR18A1, is responsible for oxidation of DON into 3-oxo-DON. DON-degrading activity is completely abolished in a mutant S3-4 strain where the AKR18A1 gene is disrupted.

Management of this population must be multidisciplinary.This paper presents the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES), Surgical Infection Society Europe (SIS-E), World Surgical Infection Society (WSIS), American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST), and Global Alliance for Infection in Surgery (GAIS) joined guidelines about the management of acute abdomen in immunocompromised patients.",EuropePMC
10.7554/elife.75490,The <i>Candida albicans</i> virulence factor candidalysin polymerizes in solution to form membrane pores and damage epithelial cells.,"<i>Candida albicans</i> causes severe invasive candidiasis. <i>C. albicans</i> infection requires the virulence factor candidalysin (CL) which damages target cell membranes. However, the mechanism that CL uses to permeabilize membranes is unclear. We reveal that CL forms membrane pores using a unique mechanism. Unexpectedly, CL readily assembled into polymers in solution. We propose that the basic structural unit in polymer formation is a CL oligomer, which is sequentially added into a string configuration that can close into a loop. CL loops appear to spontaneously insert into the membrane to become pores. A CL mutation (G4W) inhibited the formation of polymers in solution and prevented pore formation in synthetic lipid systems. Epithelial cell studies showed that G4W CL failed to activate the danger response pathway, a hallmark of the pathogenic effect of CL. These results indicate that CL polymerization in solution is a necessary step for the damage of cellular membranes. Analysis of CL pores by atomic force microscopy revealed co-existence of simple depressions and more complex pores, which are likely formed by CL assembled in an alternate oligomer orientation. We propose that this structural rearrangement represents a maturation mechanism that stabilizes pore formation to achieve more robust cellular damage. To summarize, CL uses a previously unknown mechanism to damage membranes, whereby pre-assembly of CL loops in solution leads to formation of membrane pores. Our investigation not only unravels a new paradigm for the formation of membrane pores, but additionally identifies CL polymerization as a novel therapeutic target to treat candidiasis.","<i>Candida albicans</i> causes severe invasive candidiasis. <i>C. albicans</i> infection requires the virulence factor candidalysin (CL) which damages target cell membranes.

10.1371/journal.pone.0241109,A duplex real-time PCR with probe for simultaneous detection of Geosmithia morbida and its vector Pityophthorus juglandis.,"The cultivation of walnuts (Juglans sp.) in Europe retains high economic, social, and environmental value. The recent reporting of the Thousand Cankers Disease (TCD) fungus, Geosmithia morbida, and of its vector, Pityophthorus juglandis, in walnut trees in Italy is alarming the whole of Europe. Although Italy is at present the only foothold of the disease outside North America, given the difficulties inherent in traditional identification of both members of this beetle/fungus complex, a rapid and effective protocol for the early detection and identification of TCD organisms is an absolute priority for Europe. Here we report the development of an effective and sensitive molecular tool based on simplex/duplex qPCR assays for the rapid, accurate and highly specific detection of both the bionectriaceous fungal pathogen and its bark-beetle vector. Our assay performed excellently, detecting minute amounts of target DNA without any non-specific amplification. Detection limits from various and heterogeneous matrices were lower than other reported assays. Our molecular protocol could assist in TCD organism interception at entry points, territory monitoring for the early identification and eradication of outbreaks, delineation of quarantine areas, and tracing back TCD entry and dispersal pathways.","The cultivation of walnuts (Juglans sp.) in Europe retains high economic, social, and environmental value.

10.1371/journal.pone.0138291,Cryptococcus neoformans Infection in Mice Lacking Type I Interferon Signaling Leads to Increased Fungal Clearance and IL-4-Dependent Mucin Production in the Lungs.,"Type I interferons (IFNs) are secreted by many cell types upon stimulation via pattern recognition receptors and bind to IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR), which is composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. Although type I IFNs are well known as anti-viral cytokines, limited information is available on their role during fungal infection. In the present study, we addressed this issue by examining the effect of IFNAR1 defects on the host defense response to Cryptococcus neoformans. In IFNAR1KO mice, the number of live colonies was lower and the host immune response mediated not only by Th1 but also by Th2 and Th17-related cytokines was more accelerated in the infected lungs than in WT mice. In addition, mucin production by bronchoepithelial cells and expression of MUC5AC, a major core protein of mucin in the lungs, were significantly higher in IFNAR1KO mice than in WT mice. This increase in mucin and MUC5AC production was significantly inhibited by treatment with neutralizing anti-IL-4 mAb. In contrast, administration of recombinant IFN-αA/D significantly suppressed the production of IL-4, but not of IFN-γ and IL-17A, in the lungs of WT mice after cryptococcal infection. These results indicate that defects of IFNAR1 led to improved clearance of infection with C. neoformans and enhanced synthesis of IFN-γ and the IL-4-dependent production of mucin. They also suggest that type I IFNs may be involved in the negative regulation of early host defense to this infection.","Type I interferons (IFNs) are secreted by many cell types upon stimulation via pattern recognition receptors and bind to IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR), which is composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2.

10.3390/ijms19103206,Plant Hormone Signaling Crosstalks between Biotic and Abiotic Stress Responses.,"In the natural environment, plants are often bombarded by a combination of abiotic (such as drought, salt, heat or cold) and biotic (necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogens) stresses simultaneously. It is critical to understand how the various response pathways to these stresses interact with one another within the plants, and where the points of crosstalk occur which switch the responses from one pathway to another. Calcium sensors are often regarded as the first line of response to external stimuli to trigger downstream signaling. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a major phytohormone regulating stress responses, and it interacts with the jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathways to channel resources into mitigating the effects of abiotic stresses versus defending against pathogens. The signal transduction in these pathways are often carried out via GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) which comprise of a large group of proteins that are varied in structures and functions. Deciphering the combined actions of these different signaling pathways in plants would greatly enhance the ability of breeders to develop food crops that can thrive in deteriorating environmental conditions under climate change, and that can maintain or even increase crop yield.","In the natural environment, plants are often bombarded by a combination of abiotic (such as drought, salt, heat or cold) and biotic (necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogens) stresses simultaneously.

10.1038/mi.2016.26,Eosinophils subvert host resistance to an intracellular pathogen by instigating non-protective IL-4 in CCR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice.,"Eosinophils contribute to type II immune responses in helminth infections and allergic diseases; however, their influence on intracellular pathogens is less clear. We previously reported that CCR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice exposed to the intracellular fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum exhibit dampened immunity caused by an early exaggerated interleukin (IL)-4 response. We sought to identify the cellular source promulgating IL-4 in infected mutant animals. Eosinophils were the principal instigators of non-protective IL-4 and depleting this granulocyte population improved fungal clearance in CCR2<sup>-/-</sup> animals. The deleterious impact of eosinophilia on mycosis was also recapitulated in transgenic animals overexpressing eosinophils. Mechanistic examination of IL-4 induction revealed that phagocytosis of H. capsulatum via the pattern recognition receptor complement receptor (CR) 3 triggered the heightened IL-4 response in murine eosinophils. This phenomenon was conserved in human eosinophils; exposure of cells to the fungal pathogen elicited a robust IL-4 response. Thus, our findings elucidate a detrimental attribute of eosinophil biology in fungal infections that could potentially trigger a collapse in host defenses by instigating type II immunity.","Eosinophils contribute to type II immune responses in helminth infections and allergic diseases; however, their influence on intracellular pathogens is less clear.

Existing evidence for the effectiveness of NPWT on postoperative wounds healing by primary closure remains uncertain.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the effects of NPWT for preventing SSI in wounds healing through primary closure, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of NPWT in wounds healing through primary closure.<h4>Search methods</h4>In January 2021, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries and references of included studies, systematic reviews and health technology reports. There were no restrictions on language, publication date or study setting.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included trials if they allocated participants to treatment randomly and compared NPWT with any other type of wound dressing, or compared one type of NPWT with another.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>At least two review authors independently assessed trials using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, assessment using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and quality assessment according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology. Our primary outcomes were SSI, mortality, and wound dehiscence.<h4>Main results</h4>In this fourth update, we added 18 new randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one new economic study, resulting in a total of 62 RCTs (13,340 included participants) and six economic studies. Studies evaluated NPWT in a wide range of surgeries, including orthopaedic, obstetric, vascular and general procedures. All studies compared NPWT with standard dressings. Most studies had unclear or high risk of bias for at least one key domain. Primary outcomes Eleven studies (6384 participants) which reported mortality were pooled. There is low-certainty evidence showing there may be a reduced risk of death after surgery for people treated with NPWT (0.84%) compared with standard dressings (1.17%) but there is uncertainty around this as confidence intervals include risk of benefits and harm; risk ratio (RR) 0.78 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.30; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). Fifty-four studies reported SSI; 44 studies (11,403 participants) were pooled. There is moderate-certainty evidence that NPWT probably results in fewer SSIs (8.7% of participants) than treatment with standard dressings (11.75%) after surgery; RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.85; I<sup>2</sup> = 29%). Thirty studies reported wound dehiscence; 23 studies (8724 participants) were pooled. There is moderate-certainty evidence that there is probably little or no difference in dehiscence between people treated with NPWT (6.62%) and those treated with standard dressing (6.97%), although there is imprecision around the estimate that includes risk of benefit and harms; RR 0.97 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.16; I<sup>2</sup> = 4%). Evidence was downgraded for imprecision, risk of bias, or a combination of these. Secondary outcomes There is low-certainty evidence for the outcomes of reoperation and seroma; in each case, confidence intervals included both benefit and harm. There may be a reduced risk of reoperation favouring the standard dressing arm, but this was imprecise: RR 1.13 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.41; I<sup>2</sup> = 2%; 18 trials; 6272 participants). There may be a reduced risk of seroma for people treated with NPWT but this is imprecise: the RR was 0.82 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.05; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 15 trials; 5436 participants). For skin blisters, there is low-certainty evidence that people treated with NPWT may be more likely to develop skin blisters compared with those treated with standard dressing (RR 3.55; 95% CI 1.43 to 8.77; I<sup>2</sup> = 74%; 11 trials; 5015 participants). The effect of NPWT on haematoma is uncertain (RR 0.79; 95 % CI 0.48 to 1.30; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 17 trials; 5909 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There is low-certainty evidence of little to no difference in reported pain between groups. Pain was measured in different ways and most studies could not be pooled; this GRADE assessment is based on all fourteen trials reporting pain; the pooled RR for the proportion of participants who experienced pain was 1.52 (95% CI 0.20, 11.31; I<sup>2</sup> = 34%; two studies; 632 participants). Cost-effectiveness Six economic studies, based wholly or partially on trials in our review, assessed the cost-effectiveness of NPWT compared with standard care. They considered NPWT in five indications: caesarean sections in obese women; surgery for lower limb fracture; knee/hip arthroplasty; coronary artery bypass grafts; and vascular surgery with inguinal incisions. They calculated quality-adjusted life-years or an equivalent, and produced estimates of the treatments' relative cost-effectiveness. The reporting quality was good but the evidence certainty varied from moderate to very low. There is moderate-certainty evidence that NPWT in surgery for lower limb fracture was not cost-effective at any threshold of willingness-to-pay and that NPWT is probably cost-effective in obese women undergoing caesarean section. Other studies found low or very low-certainty evidence indicating that NPWT may be cost-effective for the indications assessed.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>People with primary closure of their surgical wound and treated prophylactically with NPWT following surgery probably experience fewer SSIs  than people treated with standard dressings but there is probably no difference in wound dehiscence (moderate-certainty evidence). There may be a reduced risk of death after surgery for people treated with NPWT compared with standard dressings but there is uncertainty around this as confidence intervals include risk of benefit and harm (low-certainty evidence). People treated with NPWT may experience more instances of skin blistering compared with standard dressing treatment (low-certainty evidence). There are no clear differences in other secondary outcomes where most evidence is low or very low-certainty. Assessments of cost-effectiveness of NPWT produced differing results in different indications. There is a large number of ongoing studies, the results of which may change the findings of this review. Decisions about use of NPWT should take into account surgical indication and setting and consider evidence for all outcomes.","<h4>Background</h4>Indications for the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) are broad and include prophylaxis for surgical site infections (SSIs).

There is low-certainty evidence showing there may be a reduced risk of death after surgery for people treated with NPWT (0.84%) compared with standard dressings (1.17%) but there is uncertainty around this as confidence intervals include risk of benefits and harm; risk ratio (RR) 0.78 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.30; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). Fifty-four studies reported SSI; 44 studies (11,403 participants) were pooled. There is moderate-certainty evidence that NPWT probably results in fewer SSIs (8.7% of participants) than treatment with standard dressings (11.75%) after surgery; RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.85; I<sup>2</sup> = 29%). Thirty studies reported wound dehiscence; 23 studies (8724 participants) were pooled. There is moderate-certainty evidence that there is probably little or no difference in dehiscence between people treated with NPWT (6.62%) and those treated with standard dressing (6.97%), although there is imprecision around the estimate that includes risk of benefit and harms; RR 0.97 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.16; I<sup>2</sup> = 4%). Evidence was downgraded for imprecision, risk of bias, or a combination of these. Secondary outcomes There is low-certainty evidence for the outcomes of reoperation and seroma; in each case, confidence intervals included both benefit and harm. There may be a reduced risk of reoperation favouring the standard dressing arm, but this was imprecise: RR 1.13 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.41; I<sup>2</sup> = 2%; 18 trials; 6272 participants). There may be a reduced risk of seroma for people treated with NPWT but this is imprecise: the RR was 0.82 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.05; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 15 trials; 5436 participants). For skin blisters, there is low-certainty evidence that people treated with NPWT may be more likely to develop skin blisters compared with those treated with standard dressing (RR 3.55; 95% CI 1.43 to 8.77; I<sup>2</sup> = 74%; 11 trials; 5015 participants). The effect of NPWT on haematoma is uncertain (RR 0.79; 95 % CI 0.48 to 1.30; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 17 trials; 5909 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There is low-certainty evidence of little to no difference in reported pain between groups. Pain was measured in different ways and most studies could not be pooled; this GRADE assessment is based on all fourteen trials reporting pain; the pooled RR for the proportion of participants who experienced pain was 1.52 (95% CI 0.20, 11.31; I<sup>2</sup> = 34%; two studies; 632 participants). Cost-effectiveness Six economic studies, based wholly or partially on trials in our review, assessed the cost-effectiveness of NPWT compared with standard care. They considered NPWT in five indications: caesarean sections in obese women; surgery for lower limb fracture; knee/hip arthroplasty; coronary artery bypass grafts; and vascular surgery with inguinal incisions. They calculated quality-adjusted life-years or an equivalent, and produced estimates of the treatments' relative cost-effectiveness. The reporting quality was good but the evidence certainty varied from moderate to very low. There is moderate-certainty evidence that NPWT in surgery for lower limb fracture was not cost-effective at any threshold of willingness-to-pay and that NPWT is probably cost-effective in obese women undergoing caesarean section. Other studies found low or very low-certainty evidence indicating that NPWT may be cost-effective for the indications assessed.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>People with primary closure of their surgical wound and treated prophylactically with NPWT following surgery probably experience fewer SSIs  than people treated with standard dressings but there is probably no difference in wound dehiscence (moderate-certainty evidence). There may be a reduced risk of death after surgery for people treated with NPWT compared with standard dressings but there is uncertainty around this as confidence intervals include risk of benefit and harm (low-certainty evidence). People treated with NPWT may experience more instances of skin blistering compared with standard dressing treatment (low-certainty evidence). There are no clear differences in other secondary outcomes where most evidence is low or very low-certainty. Assessments of cost-effectiveness of NPWT produced differing results in different indications. There is a large number of ongoing studies, the results of which may change the findings of this review. Decisions about use of NPWT should take into account surgical indication and setting and consider evidence for all outcomes.",EuropePMC

The hypothesis that entomopathogenic fungi, which protect plants, benefit from the release of HIPVs was tested. The plant Arabidopsis thaliana was used as the source of HIPVs. The insect herbivore Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach) was used as the inducer, and the fungal pathogen of the aphid Lecanicillium lecanii was exposed to HIPVs to test our hypothesis. When exposed to aphid-induced A. thaliana volatiles, the mortality of aphids pre-treated with a conidial suspension of L. lecanii, the conidial germination and the appressorial formation were significantly increased compared with the control. The decan-3-ol and 4-methylpentyl isothiocyanate that were detected in the headspace seemed to have positive and negative affection, respectively. Moreover, HIPVs generated from groups of eight aphids per plant promoted significantly increased conidial germination and appressorial formation compared with HIPVs from groups of one, two and four aphids per plant. Our results demonstrated that the pathogenicity of the entomopathogenic fungus L. lecanii was enhanced when exposed to HIPVs and that the HIPVs were affected by the number of insect herbivores that induced them.","Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are clues that help predatory insects search for food.

In this study, we performed a proteome-wide propionylation analysis in the conidial and mycelial stages of <i>T. rubrum</i>. A total of 157 propionylated sites on 115 proteins were identified, and the high confidence of propionylation identification was validated by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) assay. The results show that the propionylated proteins were mostly involved in various metabolic pathways. Histones and 15 pathogenicity-related proteins were also targets for propionylation modification, suggesting their roles in epigenetic regulation and pathogenicity. A comparison of the conidial and mycelial stages revealed that most propionylated proteins and sites were growth-stage specific and independent of protein abundance. Based on the function classifications, the propionylated proteins had a similar distribution in both stages; however, some differences were also identified. Furthermore, our results show that the concentration of propionyl-CoA had a significant influence on the propionylation level. In addition to the acetylation, succinylation and propionylation identified in <i>T. rubrum</i>, 26 other PTMs were also found to exist in this fungus.

10.1128/mbio.00584-16,Lectin-Glycan Interaction Network-Based Identification of Host Receptors of Microbial Pathogenic Adhesins.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>The first step in the infection of humans by microbial pathogens is their adherence to host tissue cells, which is frequently based on the binding of carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectin-like adhesins) to human cell receptors that expose glycans. In only a few cases have the human receptors of pathogenic adhesins been described. A novel strategy-based on the construction of a lectin-glycan interaction (LGI) network-to identify the potential human binding receptors for pathogenic adhesins with lectin activity was developed. The new approach is based on linking glycan array screening results of these adhesins to a human glycoprotein database via the construction of an LGI network. This strategy was used to detect human receptors for virulent Escherichia coli (FimH adhesin), and the fungal pathogens Candida albicans (Als1p and Als3p adhesins) and C. glabrata (Epa1, Epa6, and Epa7 adhesins), which cause candidiasis. This LGI network strategy allows the profiling of potential adhesin binding receptors in the host with prioritization, based on experimental binding data, of the most relevant interactions. New potential targets for the selected adhesins were predicted and experimentally confirmed. This methodology was also used to predict lectin interactions with envelope glycoproteins of human-pathogenic viruses. It was shown that this strategy was successful in revealing that the FimH adhesin has anti-HIV activity.<h4>Importance</h4>Microbial pathogens may express a wide range of carbohydrate-specific adhesion proteins that mediate adherence to host tissues. Pathogen attachment to host cells is achieved through the binding of these lectin-like adhesins to glycans on human glycoproteins. In only a few cases have the human receptors of pathogenic adhesins been described. We developed a new strategy to predict these interacting receptors. Therefore, we developed a novel LGI network that would allow the mapping of potential adhesin binding receptors in the host with prioritization, based on the experimental binding data, of the most relevant interactions.

Even though insects are frequently reported being entrapped and killed by trichome traps, the actual trapping behavior has not yet been described in detail. Capture experiments showed that capture efficiency during the plant's vegetative stage was considerably higher than in the fruiting and cotyledon stages. The ventral surface of the leaf was more effective in trapping flies than other parts of the plant. Capture-events monitoring showed that the mouthparts, legs, and ovipositor of <i>Liriomyza trifolii</i> adults are the body parts involved in entrapment by surface trichomes on <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> plants, and subsequently, deter their ability to feed, walk, and oviposit. Of the three main body parts normally affected, mouthparts was found to be the body part most susceptible to the trichomes. Entrapments were most often caused by landing, followed by puncturing or feeding, and occasionally by walking or fighting. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy, we determined the susceptible positions of each body part and found that the flies were all trapped by hooked trichomes. This study revealed the process by which leafminer flies are entrapped by surface trichomes of the host plant and evaluated the capture efficiency. The results will contribute to our understanding of physical defenses against herbivores.","Plant trichomes often function as physical barriers in preventing arthropod feeding and oviposition.

Early authors pointed to dry summers as the trigger; around 1980, the explanation was improved via modelling of historical data. The number of precipitation days and the July temperature proved to be important, and in experiments, moist soil caused considerable mortality. This information was used in preliminary forecasting with pheromone trap catches as biofix for estimations of occurrence and survival. As more precise information on temperature effects on growth and survival was needed, we performed experiments on growth and mortality effects on egg, all larval instars and pupae. We found clear positive relations between temperatures below 35 °C and development rates of eggs, all larval instars and pupae. Mortality was also affected, and low temperature caused pronounced mortality of young larvae. The severe mortality under cold, moist conditions versus high survival under warm, dry conditions may explain both the lack of relation between captures and injuries and the pronounced fluctuations of cutworm attacks in NW Europe reported from 1905 to present. These variations are likely to increase with the climate change and suggest a reanalysis of data on trap capture and injuries to improve decision support and sustainability in Integrated Pest Management.","From 1905 to present, cutworm outbreaks have caused substantial yield losses in North Western (NW) Europe.

Many have multiple comorbid conditions, including renal impairment, nutritional deficiencies, hematologic disorders, or cancer. These conditions can impair the skin surrounding the CVAD insertion site, resulting in an increased likelihood of skin damage when standard CVAD management practices are employed. Supported by the World Congress of Vascular Access (WoCoVA), developed an evidence- and consensus-based algorithm to improve CVAD-associated skin impairment (CASI) identification and diagnosis, guide clinical decision-making, and improve clinician confidence in managing CASI. A scoping review of relevant literature surrounding CASI management was undertaken March 2014, and results were distributed to an international advisory panel. A CASI algorithm was developed by an international advisory panel of clinicians with expertise in wounds, vascular access, pediatrics, geriatric care, home care, intensive care, infection control and acute care, using a 2-phase, modified Delphi technique. The algorithm focuses on identification and treatment of skin injury, exit site infection, noninfectious exudate, and skin irritation/contact dermatitis. It comprised 3 domains: assessment, skin protection, and patient comfort. External validation of the algorithm was achieved by prospective pre- and posttest design, using clinical scenarios and self-reported clinician confidence (Likert scale), and incorporating algorithm feasibility and face validity endpoints. The CASI algorithm was found to significantly increase participants' confidence in the assessment and management of skin injury (P = .002), skin irritation/contact dermatitis (P = .001), and noninfectious exudate (P < .01).

Follow-up and therapy evaluation of syphilitic patients are poor. Little is known about positron emission tomography (PET) in syphilis. This review was to systematically review usefulness of PET for diagnosis, disease extent evaluation, follow-up, and treatment response assessment in patients with syphilis.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and three Chinese databases (SinoMed, Wanfang, and CNKI) for English and Chinese language articles from inception to September 2016. We also collected potentially relevant studies and reviews using a manual search. The search keywords included the combined text and MeSH terms ""syphilis"" and ""positron emission tomography"". We included studies that reporting syphilis with a PET scan before and/or after antibiotic treatment. The diagnosis of syphilis was based on serological criteria or dark field microscopy. Outcomes include pre- and post-treatment PET scan, pre- and post-treatment computed tomography, and pre- and post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging. We excluded the articles not published in English or Chinese or not involving humans.<h4>Results</h4>Of 258 identified articles, 34 observational studies were included. Thirty-three studies were single-patient case reports and one study was a small case series. All patients were adults. The mean age of patients was 48.3 ± 12.1 years. In primary syphilis, increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation could be seen at the site of inoculation or in the regional lymph nodes. In secondary syphilis with lung, bone, gastrointestinal involvement, or generalized lymphadenopathy, increased FDG uptake was the most commonly detected changes. In tertiary syphilis, increased glucose metabolic activity, hypometabolic lesions, or normal glucose uptake might be seen on PET. There were five types of PET scans in neurosyphilis. A repeated PET scan after treatment revealed apparent or complete resolution of the asymmetry of radiotracer uptake.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PET is helpful in targeting diagnostic interventions, characterizing disease extent, assessing nodal involvement, and treatment efficacy for syphilis.","<h4>Background</h4>Diagnosis of syphilis is difficult.

We also collected potentially relevant studies and reviews using a manual search. The search keywords included the combined text and MeSH terms ""syphilis"" and ""positron emission tomography"". We included studies that reporting syphilis with a PET scan before and/or after antibiotic treatment. The diagnosis of syphilis was based on serological criteria or dark field microscopy. Outcomes include pre- and post-treatment PET scan, pre- and post-treatment computed tomography, and pre- and post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging. We excluded the articles not published in English or Chinese or not involving humans.<h4>Results</h4>Of 258 identified articles, 34 observational studies were included. Thirty-three studies were single-patient case reports and one study was a small case series. All patients were adults. The mean age of patients was 48.3 ± 12.1 years. In primary syphilis, increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation could be seen at the site of inoculation or in the regional lymph nodes. In secondary syphilis with lung, bone, gastrointestinal involvement, or generalized lymphadenopathy, increased FDG uptake was the most commonly detected changes. In tertiary syphilis, increased glucose metabolic activity, hypometabolic lesions, or normal glucose uptake might be seen on PET. There were five types of PET scans in neurosyphilis. A repeated PET scan after treatment revealed apparent or complete resolution of the asymmetry of radiotracer uptake.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PET is helpful in targeting diagnostic interventions, characterizing disease extent, assessing nodal involvement, and treatment efficacy for syphilis.",EuropePMC

Here, we present a mouse model of low-grade candidemia to determine the effect of disseminated infection on cerebral function and relevant immune determinants. We show that intravenous injection of 25,000 C. albicans cells causes a highly localized cerebritis marked by the accumulation of activated microglial and astroglial cells around yeast aggregates, forming fungal-induced glial granulomas. Amyloid precursor protein accumulates within the periphery of these granulomas, while cleaved amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides accumulate around the yeast cells. CNS-localized C. albicans further activate the transcription factor NF-κB and induce production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and Aβ peptides enhance both phagocytic and antifungal activity from BV-2 cells. Mice infected with C. albicans display mild memory impairment that resolves with fungal clearance. Our results warrant additional studies to understand the effect of chronic cerebritis on cognitive and immune function.","Bloodborne infections with Candida albicans are an increasingly recognized complication of modern medicine.

However, JA-Ile also causes growth inhibition; and therefore JA-Ile is not a practical chemical regulator of plant defense responses. Here, we describe the rational design and synthesis of a small molecule agonist that can upregulate defense-related gene expression and promote pathogen resistance at concentrations that do not cause growth inhibition in Arabidopsis. By stabilizing interactions between COI1 and JAZ9 and JAZ10 but no other JAZ isoforms, the agonist leads to formation of JA-Ile co-receptors that selectively activate the JAZ9-EIN3/EIL1-ORA59 signaling pathway. The design of a JA-Ile agonist with high selectivity for specific protein subtypes may help promote the development of chemical regulators that do not cause a tradeoff between growth and defense.","The phytohormone 7-iso-(+)-jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) mediates plant defense responses against herbivore and pathogen attack, and thus increases plant resistance against foreign invaders.

Moreover, the modification of most disease resistance pathways made so far is detrimental to tolerance to abiotic stresses such as drought. This is largely due to negative cross-talks between disease resistance and abiotic stress tolerance signaling pathways. We have previously described the role of the rice ZBED protein containing three Zn-finger BED domains in disease resistance against the fungal pathogen <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>. The molecular and biological functions of such BED domains in plant proteins remain elusive.<h4>Results</h4>Using <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> as a heterologous system, we show that ZBED localizes in the nucleus, binds DNA, and triggers basal immunity. These activities require conserved cysteine residues of the Zn-finger BED domains that are involved in DNA binding. Interestingly, ZBED overexpressor rice lines show increased drought tolerance. More importantly, the disease resistance response conferred by ZBED is not compromised by drought-induced stress.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Together our data indicate that ZBED might represent a new type of transcriptional regulator playing simultaneously a positive role in both disease resistance and drought tolerance. We demonstrate that it is possible to provide disease resistance and drought resistance simultaneously.","<h4>Background</h4>Identifying new sources of disease resistance and the corresponding underlying resistance mechanisms remains very challenging, particularly in Monocots.

Comprehensive metabolomics profiling of plants under JA treatment provides insights into the interaction and regulation network of plant hormones. Here we applied high resolution mass spectrometry based metabolomics approach on Arabidopsis wild type and JA synthesis deficiency mutant opr3. The effects of exogenous MeJA treatment on the metabolites of opr3 were investigated. More than 10000 ion signals were detected and more than 2000 signals showed significant variation in different genotypes and treatment groups. Multivariate statistic analyses (PCA and PLS-DA) were performed and a differential compound library containing 174 metabolites with high resolution precursor ion-product ions pairs was obtained. Classification and pathway analysis of 109 identified compounds in this library showed that glucosinolates and tryptophan metabolism, amino acids and small peptides metabolism, lipid metabolism, especially fatty acyls metabolism, were impacted by endogenous JA deficiency and exogenous MeJA treatment. These results were further verified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of 21 related genes involved in the metabolism of glucosinolates, tryptophan and α-linolenic acid pathways. The results would greatly enhance our understanding of the biological functions of JA.","Jasmonates (JAs) play important roles in plant growth, development and defense.

10.3389/fpls.2016.00451,Growth and Metal Accumulation of an Alyssum murale Nickel Hyperaccumulator Ecotype Co-cropped with Alyssum montanum and Perennial Ryegrass in Serpentine Soil.,"The genus Alyssum (Brassicaceae) contains Ni hyperaccumulators (50), many of which can achieve 30 g kg(-1) Ni in dry leaf. Some Alyssum hyperaccumulators are viable candidates for commercial Ni phytoremediation and phytomining technologies. It is not known whether these species secrete organic and/or amino acids into the rhizosphere to solubilize Ni, or can make use of such acids within the soil to facilitate uptake. It has been hypothesized that in fields with mixed plant species, mobilization of metals by phytosiderophores secreted by Graminaceae plants could affect Alyssum Ni, Fe, Cu, and Mn uptake. We co-cropped the Ni hyperaccumulator Alyssum murale, non-hyperaccumulator A. montanum and perennial ryegrass in a natural serpentine soil. All treatments had standard inorganic fertilization required for ryegrass growth and one treatment was compost amended. After 4 months A. murale leaves and stems contained 3600 mg kg(-1) Ni which did not differ significantly with co-cropping. Overall Ni and Mn concentrations were significantly higher in A. murale than in A. montanum or L. perenne. Copper was not accumulated by either Alyssum species, but L. perenne accumulated up to 10 mg kg(-1). A. montanum could not compete with either A. murale or ryegrass, and neither Alyssum species survived in the compost-amended soil. Co-cropping with ryegrass reduced Fe and Mn concentrations in A. murale but not to the extent of either increasing Ni uptake or affecting plant nutrition. The hypothesized Alyssum Ni accumulation in response to phytosiderophores secreted by co-cropped grass did not occur. Our data do not support increased mobilization of Mn by a phytosiderophore mechanism either, but the converse: mobilization of Mn by the Alyssum hyperaccumulator species significantly increased Mn levels in L. perenne. Tilling soil to maximize root penetration, adequate inorganic fertilization and appropriate plant densities are more important for developing efficient phytoremediation and phytomining approaches.","The genus Alyssum (Brassicaceae) contains Ni hyperaccumulators (50), many of which can achieve 30 g kg(-1) Ni in dry leaf.

How drugs restore these functions, however, is often unknown as a drug's therapeutic effects are not limited to the proteins that the drug directly targets. Here, we develop the multiscale interactome, a powerful approach to explain disease treatment. We integrate disease-perturbed proteins, drug targets, and biological functions into a multiscale interactome network. We then develop a random walk-based method that captures how drug effects propagate through a hierarchy of biological functions and physical protein-protein interactions. On three key pharmacological tasks, the multiscale interactome predicts drug-disease treatment, identifies proteins and biological functions related to treatment, and predicts genes that alter a treatment's efficacy and adverse reactions. Our results indicate that physical interactions between proteins alone cannot explain treatment since many drugs treat diseases by affecting the biological functions disrupted by the disease rather than directly targeting disease proteins or their regulators. We provide a general framework for explaining treatment, even when drugs seem unrelated to the diseases they are recommended for.","Most diseases disrupt multiple proteins, and drugs treat such diseases by restoring the functions of the disrupted proteins.

This appeared to be caused by deposition of AIM at the necrotic peritoneum in AIM <sup>+/+</sup> mice. In vitro, AIM enhanced the engulfment of necrotic debris by macrophages derived from zymosan-induced peritonitis, M1- and M2a-like bone marrow derived macrophages, as well as by mesothelial cells.

Then, lignan-like substances, such as Schisanhenol B, were detected via High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-ElectroSpray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) analyses of the active fractions. Moreover, the results from biological tests on colony growth inhibition and spore germination indicated that SE-I, SE-II, and SE-III could inhibit hyphal growth and spore generation of three important plant pathogenic fungi (Monilinia fructicola, Fusarium oxysporum, and Botryosphaeria dothidea). The study of the mechanisms of resistant fungi revealed that the oxidation resistance system, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), was activated. The expression of genes related to defense, such as pathogenesis-related protein (PR4), α-farnesene synthase (AFS), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) were shown to be up-regulated after treatment with SEs, which suggested an increase in apple immunity and that fruits were induced to effectively defend against the infection of pathogenic fungi (B. dothidea). This study revealed that SEs and their lignans represent promising resources for the development of safe, effective, and multi-targeted agents against pathogenic fungi.","Schisandra chinensis extracts (SEs) have traditionally been used as an oriental medicine for the treatment of various human diseases, however, their further application in the biocontrol of plant disease remains poorly understood.

10.14639/0392-100x-669,Outcome predictors of treatment effectiveness for fungal malignant external otitis: a systematic review.,"The aim of this review is to summarise literature data on clinical aspects and traditional management of fungal malignant external otitis (FMEO), and to identify potential predictive factors of positive treatment outcome. Articles were initially selected based on their titles or abstracts. Full articles were then retrieved and further scrutinised according to predetermined criteria. Reference lists of selected articles were searched for any missed publications. The selected articles were methodologically evaluated. Of an initial 143 references, 14 were selected that focalised on the management of FMEO. The majority of studies demonstrated a correlation between treatment effectiveness, assessed as symptom resolution, and clinical and management variables: abstention from surgical debridement, absence of facial palsy, Aspergillus spp. as causative pathogen and absence of imaging findings at diagnosis and follow-up. The effectiveness of FMEO treatment depends on the assessment of cranial nerve state, the causative pathogen and imaging findings. Above all, absence of facial nerve palsy, Aspergillus spp. and absence of radiological signs at diagnosis and during follow-up correlate with symptom resolution. The fact that conservative treatment may be associated with a better outcome than surgical debridement could purely reflect that patients with more aggressive and advanced illness required debridement, whereas milder disease was treated conservatively. Thus, caution should be advised in the interpretation of data due to the need for further trials on the topic.","The aim of this review is to summarise literature data on clinical aspects and traditional management of fungal malignant external otitis (FMEO), and to identify potential predictive factors of positive treatment outcome.

Biocontrol products must be developed, and their efficacy demonstrated before widespread use. Efficacy of two aflatoxin biocontrol products, Aflasafe GH01 and Aflasafe GH02, were evaluated in 800 maize and groundnut farmers' fields during 2015 and 2016 in the Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, Northern, Upper East, and Upper West regions of Ghana. Both products were developed after an extensive examination of fungi associated with maize and groundnut in Ghana. Each product contains as active ingredient fungi four <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> isolates belonging to atoxigenic African <i>Aspergillus</i> Vegetative Compatibility Groups (AAVs) widely distributed across Ghana. An untreated field was maintained for each treated field to determine product efficacy. Proportions of atoxigenic AAVs composing each product were assessed in soils before product application, and soils and grains at harvest. Significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05) displacement of toxigenic fungi occurred in both crops during both years, in all five regions. Biocontrol-treated crops consistently had significantly (<i>P</i> < 0.05) less aflatoxins (range = 76% to 100% less; average = 99% less) than untreated crops. Results indicate that both biocontrol products are highly efficient, cost-effective, environmentally safe tools for aflatoxin mitigation. Most crops from treated fields could have been sold in both local and international food and feed premium markets. Adoption and use of biocontrol products have the potential to improve the health of Ghanaians, and both income and trade opportunities of farmers, aggregators, distributors, and traders.","Biological control is one of the recommended methods for aflatoxin mitigation.

10.1016/j.mex.2016.03.011,Computer-assisted image processing to detect spores from the fungus Pandora neoaphidis.,"This contribution demonstrates an example of experimental automatic image analysis to detect spores prepared on microscope slides derived from trapping. The application is to monitor aerial spore counts of the entomopathogenic fungus Pandora neoaphidis which may serve as a biological control agent for aphids. Automatic detection of such spores can therefore play a role in plant protection. The present approach for such detection is a modification of traditional manual microscopy of prepared slides, where autonomous image recording precedes computerised image analysis. The purpose of the present image analysis is to support human visual inspection of imagery data - not to replace it. The workflow has three components:•Preparation of slides for microscopy.•Image recording.•Computerised image processing where the initial part is, as usual, segmentation depending on the actual data product. Then comes identification of blobs, calculation of principal axes of blobs, symmetry operations and projection on a three parameter egg shape space.","This contribution demonstrates an example of experimental automatic image analysis to detect spores prepared on microscope slides derived from trapping.

10.1371/journal.pone.0142212,Long-Acting Beta Agonists Enhance Allergic Airway Disease.,"Asthma is one of the most common of medical illnesses and is treated in part by drugs that activate the beta-2-adrenoceptor (β2-AR) to dilate obstructed airways. Such drugs include long acting beta agonists (LABAs) that are paradoxically linked to excess asthma-related mortality. Here we show that LABAs such as salmeterol and structurally related β2-AR drugs such as formoterol and carvedilol, but not short-acting agonists (SABAs) such as albuterol, promote exaggerated asthma-like allergic airway disease and enhanced airway constriction in mice. We demonstrate that salmeterol aberrantly promotes activation of the allergic disease-related transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) in multiple mouse and human cells. A novel inhibitor of STAT6, PM-242H, inhibited initiation of allergic disease induced by airway fungal challenge, reversed established allergic airway disease in mice, and blocked salmeterol-dependent enhanced allergic airway disease. Thus, structurally related β2-AR ligands aberrantly activate STAT6 and promote allergic airway disease. This untoward pharmacological property likely explains adverse outcomes observed with LABAs, which may be overcome by agents that antagonize STAT6.","Asthma is one of the most common of medical illnesses and is treated in part by drugs that activate the beta-2-adrenoceptor (β2-AR) to dilate obstructed airways.

10.1093/conphys/coz015,The impact of a changing winter climate on the hatch phenology of one of North America's largest Atlantic salmon populations.,"In northern temperate regions, some of the most dramatic effects of climate change are expected during the winter. Understanding how changing winter climates influence the seasonal timing of key life events is critical for implementing effective conservation strategies, especially for poikilotherms, whose physiology and development are particularly sensitive to changes in thermal environment. Four mathematical models are available to predict the timing of hatch and emergence in Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>); however, such models are only useful if the effect of temperature is both repeatable within and among maternal families, and predictable across variable temperature regimes. Using a split-brood experiment, we found the timing of hatch to be repeatable and predictable in Atlantic salmon from the Exploits River, one of the largest remaining wild populations in North America. Three of the available mathematical models under-estimated the timing of hatch by an average of 21-26 accumulated thermal units (ATU); however, we identified one model that provided reasonable estimates of hatch timing (average under-estimate 7 ATU) under the three incubation temperature regimes we tested. We applied this model to daily water temperature profiles from 2006-18 at four sites within the Exploits River watershed. Across all years and sites, the predicted dates at 50% hatch ranged between 8 March and 23 May, while predicted dates of 50% emergence ranged from 11 May to 13 June. By identifying the seasonal timing of these particularly vulnerable early life stages, this model can aid the implementation of conservation efforts for this ecologically and economically important population.","In northern temperate regions, some of the most dramatic effects of climate change are expected during the winter.

10.1038/srep33687,Quinone derivatives isolated from the endolichenic fungus Phialocephala fortinii are Mdr1 modulators that combat azole resistance in Candida albicans.,"One of the main azole-resistance mechanisms in Candida pathogens is the upregulation of drug efflux pumps, which compromises the efficacy of azoles and results in treatment failure. The combination of azole-antifungal agents with efflux pump inhibitors represents a promising strategy to combat fungal infection. High-throughput screening of 150 extracts obtained from endolichenic fungal cultures led to the discovery that the extract of Phialocephala fortinii exhibits potent activity for the reversal of azole resistance. From P. fortinii cultures, a total of 15 quinone derivatives, comprising 11 new derivatives and 4 known compounds, were obtained. Among these compounds, palmarumycin P3 (3) and phialocephalarin B (8) specifically modulate the expression of MDR1 to inhibit the activity of drug efflux pumps and therefore reverse azole resistance.

10.1371/journal.ppat.1005662,Dectin-3 Deficiency Promotes Colitis Development due to Impaired Antifungal Innate Immune Responses in the Gut.,"Interactions between commensal fungi and gut immune system are critical for establishing colonic homeostasis. Here we found that mice deficient in Dectin-3 (Clec4d-/-), a C-type lectin receptor that senses fungal infection, were more susceptible to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis compared with wild-type mice. The specific fungal burden of Candida (C.) tropicalis was markedly increased in the gut after DSS treatment in Clec4d-/- mice, and supplementation with C. tropicalis aggravated colitis only in Clec4d-/- mice, but not in wild-type controls. Mechanistically, Dectin-3 deficiency impairs phagocytic and fungicidal abilities of macrophages, and C. tropicalis-induced NF-κB activation and cytokine production. The conditioned media derived from Dectin-3-deficient macrophages were defective in promoting tissue repairing in colonic epithelial cells. Finally, anti-fungal therapy was effective in treating colitis in Clec4d-/- mice. These studies identified the role of Dectin-3 and its functional interaction with commensal fungi in intestinal immune system and regulation of colonic homeostasis.","Interactions between commensal fungi and gut immune system are critical for establishing colonic homeostasis.

10.1038/hortres.2015.22,Amplicon-based metagenomics identified candidate organisms in soils that caused yield decline in strawberry.,"A phenomenon of yield decline due to weak plant growth in strawberry was recently observed in non-chemo-fumigated soils, which was not associated with the soil fungal pathogen Verticillium dahliae, the main target of fumigation. Amplicon-based metagenomics was used to profile soil microbiota in order to identify microbial organisms that may have caused the yield decline. A total of 36 soil samples were obtained in 2013 and 2014 from four sites for metagenomic studies; two of the four sites had a yield-decline problem, the other two did not. More than 2000 fungal or bacterial operational taxonomy units (OTUs) were found in these samples. Relative abundance of individual OTUs was statistically compared for differences between samples from sites with or without yield decline. A total of 721 individual comparisons were statistically significant - involving 366 unique bacterial and 44 unique fungal OTUs. Based on further selection criteria, we focused on 34 bacterial and 17 fungal OTUs and found that yield decline resulted probably from one or more of the following four factors: (1) low abundance of Bacillus and Pseudomonas populations, which are well known for their ability of supressing pathogen development and/or promoting plant growth; (2) lack of the nematophagous fungus (Paecilomyces species); (3) a high level of two non-specific fungal root rot pathogens; and (4) wet soil conditions.

10.1002/14651858.cd014884.pub2,Intravenous immunoglobulin for the treatment of Kawasaki disease.,"<h4>Background</h4>Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) that mainly affects children. Symptoms include fever, chapped lips, strawberry tongue, red eyes (bulbar conjunctival injection), rash, redness, swollen hands and feet or skin peeling; and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. High fevers and systemic inflammation characterise the acute phase. Inflammation of the coronary arteries causes the most serious complication of the disease, coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs). The primary treatment is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA/aspirin), with doses and regimens differing between institutions. It is important to know which regimens are the safest and most effective in preventing complications.<h4>Objectives</h4>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of IVIG in treating and preventing cardiac consequences of Kawasaki disease.<h4>Search methods</h4>The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 26 April 2022.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the use of IVIG for the treatment of KD. We included studies involving treatment for initial or refractory KD, or both.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were incidence of CAAs and incidence of any adverse effects after treatment. Our secondary outcomes were acute coronary syndromes, duration of fever, need for additional treatment, length of hospital stay, and mortality. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.<h4>Main results</h4>We identified 31 RCTs involving a total of 4609 participants with KD. Studies compared IVIG with ASA, another dose or regimen of IVIG, prednisolone, or infliximab. The majority of studies reported on primary treatment, so those results are reported below. A limited number of studies investigated secondary or tertiary treatment in IVIG-resistant patients. Doses and regimens of IVIG infusion varied between studies, and all studies had some concerns related to risk of bias. Primary treatment with IVIG compared to ASA for people with KD Compared to ASA treatment, IVIG probably reduces the incidence of CAAs in people with KD up to 30 days (odds ratio (OR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.87; 11 studies, 1437 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The individual studies reported a range of adverse effects, but there was little to no difference in numbers of adverse effects between treatment groups (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.89; 10 studies, 1376 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was limited evidence for the incidence of acute coronary syndromes, so we are uncertain of any effects. Duration of fever days from treatment onset was probably shorter in the IVIG group (mean difference (MD) -4.00 days, 95% CI -5.06 to -2.93; 3 studies, 307 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was little or no difference between groups in need for additional treatment (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.57; 3 studies, 272 participants; low-certainty evidence). No study reported length of hospital stay, and no deaths were reported in either group. Primary treatment with IVIG compared to different infusion regimens of IVIG for people with KD Higher-dose regimens of IVIG probably reduce the incidence of CAAs compared to medium- or lower-dose regimens of IVIG up to 30 days (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.89; 8 studies, 1824 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference in the number of adverse effects between groups (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.37; 6 studies, 1659 participants; low-certainty evidence). No study reported on acute coronary syndromes. Higher-dose IVIG may reduce the duration of fever compared to medium- or lower-dose regimens (MD -0.71 days, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.06; 4 studies, 992 participants; low-certainty evidence). Higher-dose regimens may reduce the need for additional treatment (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.88; 4 studies, 1125 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not detect a clear difference in length of hospital stay between infusion regimens (MD -0.24, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.30; 3 studies, 752 participants; low-certainty evidence). One study reported mortality, and there was little to no difference detected between regimens (moderate-certainty evidence). Primary treatment with IVIG compared to prednisolone for people with KD The evidence comparing IVIG with prednisolone on incidence of CAA is very uncertain (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.48; 2 studies, 140 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and there was little to no difference between groups in adverse effects (OR 4.18, 95% CI 0.19 to 89.48; 1 study; 90 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain of the impact on duration of fever, as two studies reported this outcome differently and showed conflicting results. One study reported on acute coronary syndromes and mortality, finding little or no difference between groups (low-certainty evidence). No study reported the need for additional treatment or length of hospital stay.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>The included RCTs investigated a variety of comparisons, and the small number of events observed during the study periods limited detection of effects. The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low due to concerns related to risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. The available evidence indicated that high-dose IVIG regimens are probably associated with a reduced risk of CAA formation compared to ASA or medium- or low-dose IVIG regimens. There were no clinically significant differences in incidence of adverse effects, which suggests there is little concern about the safety of IVIG. Compared to ASA, high-dose IVIG probably reduced the duration of fever, but there was little or no difference detected in the need for additional treatment. Compared to medium- or low-dose IVIG, there may be reduced duration of fever and reduced need for additional treatment. We were unable to draw any conclusions regarding acute coronary syndromes, mortality, or length of hospital stay, or for the comparison IVIG versus prednisolone. Our findings are in keeping with current guideline recommendations and evidence from long-term epidemiology studies.","<h4>Background</h4>Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) that mainly affects children.

It is important to know which regimens are the safest and most effective in preventing complications.<h4>Objectives</h4>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of IVIG in treating and preventing cardiac consequences of Kawasaki disease.<h4>Search methods</h4>The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 26 April 2022.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the use of IVIG for the treatment of KD. We included studies involving treatment for initial or refractory KD, or both.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were incidence of CAAs and incidence of any adverse effects after treatment. Our secondary outcomes were acute coronary syndromes, duration of fever, need for additional treatment, length of hospital stay, and mortality. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.<h4>Main results</h4>We identified 31 RCTs involving a total of 4609 participants with KD. Studies compared IVIG with ASA, another dose or regimen of IVIG, prednisolone, or infliximab. The majority of studies reported on primary treatment, so those results are reported below. A limited number of studies investigated secondary or tertiary treatment in IVIG-resistant patients. Doses and regimens of IVIG infusion varied between studies, and all studies had some concerns related to risk of bias. Primary treatment with IVIG compared to ASA for people with KD Compared to ASA treatment, IVIG probably reduces the incidence of CAAs in people with KD up to 30 days (odds ratio (OR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.87; 11 studies, 1437 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The individual studies reported a range of adverse effects, but there was little to no difference in numbers of adverse effects between treatment groups (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.89; 10 studies, 1376 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was limited evidence for the incidence of acute coronary syndromes, so we are uncertain of any effects. Duration of fever days from treatment onset was probably shorter in the IVIG group (mean difference (MD) -4.00 days, 95% CI -5.06 to -2.93; 3 studies, 307 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was little or no difference between groups in need for additional treatment (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.57; 3 studies, 272 participants; low-certainty evidence). No study reported length of hospital stay, and no deaths were reported in either group. Primary treatment with IVIG compared to different infusion regimens of IVIG for people with KD Higher-dose regimens of IVIG probably reduce the incidence of CAAs compared to medium- or lower-dose regimens of IVIG up to 30 days (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.89; 8 studies, 1824 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference in the number of adverse effects between groups (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.37; 6 studies, 1659 participants; low-certainty evidence). No study reported on acute coronary syndromes. Higher-dose IVIG may reduce the duration of fever compared to medium- or lower-dose regimens (MD -0.71 days, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.06; 4 studies, 992 participants; low-certainty evidence). Higher-dose regimens may reduce the need for additional treatment (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.88; 4 studies, 1125 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not detect a clear difference in length of hospital stay between infusion regimens (MD -0.24, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.30; 3 studies, 752 participants; low-certainty evidence). One study reported mortality, and there was little to no difference detected between regimens (moderate-certainty evidence). Primary treatment with IVIG compared to prednisolone for people with KD The evidence comparing IVIG with prednisolone on incidence of CAA is very uncertain (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.48; 2 studies, 140 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and there was little to no difference between groups in adverse effects (OR 4.18, 95% CI 0.19 to 89.48; 1 study; 90 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain of the impact on duration of fever, as two studies reported this outcome differently and showed conflicting results. One study reported on acute coronary syndromes and mortality, finding little or no difference between groups (low-certainty evidence). No study reported the need for additional treatment or length of hospital stay.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>The included RCTs investigated a variety of comparisons, and the small number of events observed during the study periods limited detection of effects. The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low due to concerns related to risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. The available evidence indicated that high-dose IVIG regimens are probably associated with a reduced risk of CAA formation compared to ASA or medium- or low-dose IVIG regimens. There were no clinically significant differences in incidence of adverse effects, which suggests there is little concern about the safety of IVIG. Compared to ASA, high-dose IVIG probably reduced the duration of fever, but there was little or no difference detected in the need for additional treatment. Compared to medium- or low-dose IVIG, there may be reduced duration of fever and reduced need for additional treatment. We were unable to draw any conclusions regarding acute coronary syndromes, mortality, or length of hospital stay, or for the comparison IVIG versus prednisolone. Our findings are in keeping with current guideline recommendations and evidence from long-term epidemiology studies.",EuropePMC

The recognition of elder abuse is complex due to a lack of awareness and knowledge. In this systematic review, types, characteristics and anatomic location of physical signs in elder abuse were identified.<h4>Methods</h4>Databases of MEDLINE, COCHRANE, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched. The publication dates ranged from March 2005 to July 2020. In addition to the electronic searches, the reference lists and citing of included articles were hand-searched to identify additional relevant studies. The quality of descriptive and mixed-methods studies was assessed.<h4>Results</h4>The most commonly described physical signs in elder abuse were bruises. The characteristics of physical signs can be categorized into size, shape and distribution. Physical signs were anatomically predominantly located on the head, face/maxillofacial area (including eyes, ears and dental area), neck, upper extremities and torso (especially posterior). Physical signs related to sexual elder abuse were mostly located in the genital and perianal area and often accompanied by a significant amount of injury to non-genital parts of the body, especially the area of the head, arms and medial aspect of the thigh.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Most common types, characteristics and anatomic location of physical signs in elder abuse were identified. To enhance (early) detection of physical signs in elder abuse, it is necessary to invest in (more) in-depth education and to include expertise from a forensic physician or forensic nurse in multidisciplinary team consultations.","<h4>Purpose</h4>Elder abuse is a worldwide problem with serious consequences for individuals and society.

Understanding how they react and the way pathogens adapt to such combinational stresses is poorly documented. Here, we developed an experimental system mimicking field intermittent drought on rice followed by inoculation by the pathogenic fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>. This experimental system triggers an enhancement of susceptibility that could be correlated with the dampening of several aspects of plant immunity, namely the oxidative burst and the transcription of several pathogenesis-related genes. Quite strikingly, the analysis of fungal transcription by RNASeq analysis under drought reveals that the fungus is greatly modifying its virulence program: genes coding for small secreted proteins were massively repressed in droughted plants compared to unstressed ones whereas genes coding for enzymes involved in degradation of cell-wall were induced. We also show that drought can lead to the partial breakdown of several major resistance genes by affecting <i>R</i> plant gene and/or pathogen effector expression. We propose a model where a yet unknown plant signal can trigger a change in the virulence program of the pathogen to adapt to a plant host that was affected by drought prior to infection.","Plants are often facing several stresses simultaneously.

(Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) for insect biomass production included selecting for larger size pupae. The effects of an 8-yr continuous selection of T. molitor pupae for larger size were studied. Data consisting of daily counts and weights of pupae were analyzed using regression to determine the effects of selection over time. A preliminary evaluation of food conversion, growth, fecundity, and larval survival was done to compare ancestral versus selected strains. A significant positive correlation was identified between pupal size and time indicating a significant increase in pupal size over time in the selected T. molitor strain. A preliminary comparison of ancestral and selected strains showed significantly larger pupal size, growth rate, fecundity, and efficiency of conversion of ingested food in the selected strain. However, the selected strain also showed significantly lower larval survival than the ancestral strain. The low larval survival impacted the overall productivity of the selected strain resulting in no significant differences in biomass production when compared with the ancestral strain. The potential of using selection to improve biomass productivity in T. molitor is discussed.","Efforts to improve rearing conditions of Tenebrio molitor L.

10.1038/s41598-019-41564-9,Phenylpyrrole fungicides act on triosephosphate isomerase to induce methylglyoxal stress and alter hybrid histidine kinase activity.,"Fludioxonil, a natural product of pyrrolnitrin, is a potent fungicide used on crops worldwide. Drug action requires the presence of a group III hybrid histidine kinase (HHK) and the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway. We have reported that the drug does not act directly on HHK, but triggers the conversion of the kinase to a phosphatase, which dephosphorylates Ypd1 to constitutively activate HOG signaling. Still, the direct drug target remains unknown and mode of action ill defined. Here, we heterologously expressed a group III HHK, dimorphism-regulating kinase 1 (Drk1) in Saccharomyces cerevisae to delineate fludioxonil's target and action. We show that the drug interferes with triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) causing release of methylglyoxal (MG). MG activates the group III HHK and thus the HOG pathway. Drug action involved Drk1 cysteine 392, as a C392S substitution increased drug resistance in vivo. Drug sensitivity was reversed by dimedone treatment, indicating Drk1 responds in vivo to an aldehydic stress. Fludioxonil treatment triggered elevated cytosolic methylglyoxal. Likewise, methylglyoxal treatment of Drk1-expressing yeast phenocopied treatment with fludioxonil. Fludioxonil directly inhibited TPI and also caused it to release methylglyoxal in vitro. Thus, TPI is a drug target of the phenylpyrrole class of fungicides, inducing elevated MG which alters HHK activity, likely converting the kinase to a phosphatase that acts on Ypd1 to trigger HOG pathway activation and fungal cell death.","Fludioxonil, a natural product of pyrrolnitrin, is a potent fungicide used on crops worldwide.

Here, we demonstrate the development of lung-targeting drug-loaded liposomes and their efficacy, specificity and safety. Our study focuses on glucocorticoids methylprednisolone (MPS), a commonly used drug to treat lung injuries. The steroidal molecule was loaded into functionalized nano-sterically stabilized unilamellar liposomes (NSSLs). Targeting functionality was performed through conjugation of surfactant protein A (SPANb) nanobodies to form MPS-NSSLs-SPANb. MPS-NSSLs-SPANb exhibited good size distribution, morphology, and encapsulation efficiency. Animal experiments demonstrated the high specificity of MPS-NSSLs-SPANb to the lung. Treatment with MPS-NSSLs-SPANb reduced the levels of TNF-α, IL-8, and TGF-β1 in rat bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the expression of NK-κB in the lung tissues, thereby alleviating lung injuries and increasing rat survival. The nanobody functionalized nanoparticles demonstrate superior performance to treat lung injury when compared to that of antibody functionalized systems.","The advent of nanomedicine requires novel delivery vehicles to actively target their site of action.

It is associated with high death rates and with disability in people who survive. Corticosteroids have been used as an adjunct to antituberculous drugs to treat people with tuberculous meningitis, but their role has been controversial.<h4>Objectives</h4>To evaluate the effects of corticosteroids as an adjunct to antituberculous treatment on death and severe disability in people with tuberculous meningitis.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register up to the 18 March 2016; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; and Current Controlled Trials. We also contacted researchers and organizations working in the field, and checked reference lists.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomized controlled trials that compared corticosteroid plus antituberculous treatment with antituberculous treatment alone in people with clinically diagnosed tuberculous meningitis and included death or disability as outcome measures.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We independently assessed search results and methodological quality, and extracted data from the included trials. We analysed the data using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and used a fixed-effect model. We performed an intention-to-treat analysis, where we included all participants randomized to treatment in the denominator. This analysis assumes that all participants who were lost to follow-up have good outcomes. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of the missing data.<h4>Main results</h4>Nine trials that included 1337 participants (with 469 deaths) met the inclusion criteria.At follow-up from three to 18 months, steroids reduce deaths by almost one quarter (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; nine trials, 1337 participants, high quality evidence).

However, this small possible harm is unlikely to be quantitatively important when compared to the reduction in mortality.The number of HIV-positive people included in the review is small, so we are not sure if the benefits in terms of reduced mortality are preserved in this group of patients.","<h4>Background</h4>Tuberculous meningitis is a serious form of tuberculosis (TB) that affects the meninges that cover a person's brain and spinal cord. It is associated with high death rates and with disability in people who survive. Corticosteroids have been used as an adjunct to antituberculous drugs to treat people with tuberculous meningitis, but their role has been controversial.<h4>Objectives</h4>To evaluate the effects of corticosteroids as an adjunct to antituberculous treatment on death and severe disability in people with tuberculous meningitis.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register up to the 18 March 2016; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; and Current Controlled Trials. We also contacted researchers and organizations working in the field, and checked reference lists.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomized controlled trials that compared corticosteroid plus antituberculous treatment with antituberculous treatment alone in people with clinically diagnosed tuberculous meningitis and included death or disability as outcome measures.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We independently assessed search results and methodological quality, and extracted data from the included trials. We analysed the data using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and used a fixed-effect model. We performed an intention-to-treat analysis, where we included all participants randomized to treatment in the denominator. This analysis assumes that all participants who were lost to follow-up have good outcomes. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of the missing data.<h4>Main results</h4>Nine trials that included 1337 participants (with 469 deaths) met the inclusion criteria.At follow-up from three to 18 months, steroids reduce deaths by almost one quarter (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; nine trials, 1337 participants, high quality evidence). Disabling neurological deficit is not common in survivors, and steroids may have little or no effect on this outcome (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.20; eight trials, 1314 participants, low quality evidence).

10.1371/journal.pone.0177868,Chemically induced disseminated pythiosis in BALB/c mice: A new experimental model for Pythium insidiosum infection.,"Pythiosis is a severe and life-threatening disease that affects humans and various animal species. We report a model of vascular/disseminated pythiosis occurring after subcutaneous inoculation of 2 x 104 Pythium insidiosum zoospores/mL in immunocompromised BALB/c mice. For this model, we carried out two rounds of experiments. First, we evaluated two protocols of immunosuppression before inoculation: cyclophosphamide at 150 mg/kg (CYP group) and cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg plus hydrocortisone acetate at 250 mg/kg (CYP+HCA group). It was not possible to obtain mortality in the CYP group; however, the combination of CYP+HCA altered disease outcomes, with mortality rates reaching 60%. Second, we used the CYP+HCA immunosuppression protocol to analyze the histological and immunological statuses triggered by disease. When we inoculated immunocompetent mice with P. insidiosum zoospores, self-healing occurred via increased levels of IL-2, IFN-γ and IL-17A, which are characteristic of the Th1/Th17 cytokine response. For infected and immunosuppressed mice, the cytokine profiles showed high levels of IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-α. Increased IL-10 values are related to fungal infection susceptibility and led us to speculate that infection may be established through suppression of the host immune response. In addition, histopathological evaluation of the kidneys and liver demonstrated the presence of hyphae and the cellular findings suggested an acute vascular inflammation that mimics vascular/disseminated pythiosis in humans. This is the first murine model for pythiosis that is useful both for understanding the pathogenesis of this disease and for evaluating new treatment approaches.","Pythiosis is a severe and life-threatening disease that affects humans and various animal species.

The aim of this work was to study the isolation, identification and molecular analysis of <i>Trichosporon</i> species in soil.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In order to isolate and identify <i>Trichosporon</i> species in soil, 30 samples were collected from 30 different locations across Iran. The isolates were identified by means of the standard methods of yeast identification. To confirm morphological identification, genomic DNA was extracted and the hypervariable D1/D2 domain of the large-subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using primer pair NL-1/NL-4, and then the sequences were analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>According to the morphological and physiological assessments, isolates were identified as <i>T. coremiiforme</i>. The isolates formed chlamydospore after one week on yeast-malt (YM) agar medium. Using Blast program, we found that the D1/D2 sequences of the <i>T. coremiiforme</i> isolates from Iran (accession no: KP055040 and KP055041) showed 99% homology with the <i>T. coremiiforme</i> deposited in GenBank.

10.1016/j.jspr.2017.03.008,Impact of storage environment on the efficacy of hermetic storage bags.,"Small hermetic bags (50 and 100 kg capacities) used by smallholder farmers in several African countries have proven to be a low-cost solution for preventing storage losses due to insects. The complexity of postharvest practices and the need for ideal drying conditions, especially in the Sub-Sahara, has led to questions about the efficacy of the hermetic bags for controlling spoilage by fungi and the potential for mycotoxin accumulation. This study compared the effects of environmental temperature and relative humidity at two locations (Indiana and Arkansas) on dry maize (14% moisture content) in woven polypropylene bags and Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) hermetic bags. Temperature and relative humidity data loggers placed in the middle of each bag provided profiles of environmental influences on stored grain at the two locations. The results indicated that the PICS bags prevented moisture penetration over the three-month storage period. In contrast, maize in the woven bags increased in moisture content. For both bag types, no evidence was obtained indicating the spread of <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> from colonized maize to adjacent non-colonized maize. However, other storage fungi did increase during storage. The number of infected kernels did not increase in the PICS bags, but the numbers in the woven bags increased significantly. The warmer environment in Arkansas resulted in significantly higher insect populations in the woven bags than in Indiana. Insects in the PICS bags remained low at both locations. This study demonstrates that the PICS hermetic bags are effective at blocking the effects of external humidity fluctuations as well as the spread of fungi to non-infected kernels.","Small hermetic bags (50 and 100 kg capacities) used by smallholder farmers in several African countries have proven to be a low-cost solution for preventing storage losses due to insects.

10.3389/fpls.2020.00875,Vitamin B6 Is Under a Tight Balance During Disease Development by <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> on Different Cultivars of Potato and on <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Mutants.,"Vitamin B6 is well recognized as an essential antioxidant and plays a role in stress responses. Co-expression of plant and pathogen-derived vitamin B6 genes is critical during disease development of <i>R. solani</i>. However, little is known about the functionality of vitamin B6 vitamers during plant-<i>R. solani</i> interactions and their involvement in disease tolerance. Here, we explored the possible involvement of vitamin B6 during disease progression of potato cultivars of different susceptibility levels to <i>R. solani</i>. A distinct pattern of gene expression, pyridoxine (PN) concentration, and fungal biomass was found in the susceptible cv. Russet Burbank and tolerant cv. Chieftain. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in <i>R. solani</i> mycelia or plant tissues applying non-fluorescence or fluorescence methods was related to up-regulation in the vitamin B6 pathway and is indicative of oxidative stress. Russet Burbank was susceptible to <i>R. solani</i>, which was linked to reduced amounts of VB6 content. Prior to infection, constitutive PN levels were significantly higher in Russet Burbank by 1.6-fold compared to Chieftain. Upon infection with <i>R. solani</i>, PN levels in infected tissues increased more in Chieftain (1.7-fold) compared to Russet Burbank (1.4-fold). <i>R. solani</i> AG3 infection of potato sprouts in both cultivars significantly activates the fungal and plant vitamin B6 and glutathione-<i>S</i>-transferase (GST) genes in a tissue-specific response. Significant fold increases of transcript abundance of the fungal genes ranged from a minimum of 3.60 (<i>RsolSG3GST</i>) to a maximum of 13.91 (<i>RsolAG3PDX2</i>) in the surrounding necrotic lesion tissues (zone 1). On the other hand, PCA showed that the top plant genes <i>STGST</i> and <i>STPDX1.1</i> were linked to both tissues of necrotic lesions (zone 2) and their surrounding areas of necrotic lesions. Functional characterization of Arabidopsis <i>pdx1.3</i> mutants challenged with <i>R. solani</i> provided evidence into the role of the vitamin B6 pathway in the maintenance of plant tolerance during disease progression.

10.1111/pce.13443,Integration of two herbivore-induced plant volatiles results in synergistic effects on plant defence and resistance.,"Plants can use induced volatiles to detect herbivore- and pathogen-attacked neighbors and prime their defenses. Several individual volatile priming cues have been identified, but whether plants are able to integrate multiple cues from stress-related volatile blends remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how maize plants respond to two herbivore-induced volatile priming cues with complementary information content, the green leaf volatile (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate (HAC) and the aromatic volatile indole. In the absence of herbivory, HAC directly induced defence gene expression, whereas indole had no effect. Upon induction by simulated herbivory, both volatiles increased jasmonate signalling, defence gene expression, and defensive secondary metabolite production and increased plant resistance. Plant resistance to caterpillars was more strongly induced in dual volatile-exposed plants than plants exposed to single volatiles.. Induced defence levels in dual volatile-exposed plants were significantly higher than predicted from the added effects of the individual volatiles, with the exception of induced plant volatile production, which showed no increase upon dual-exposure relative to single exposure. Thus, plants can integrate different volatile cues into strong and specific responses that promote herbivore defence induction and resistance. Integrating multiple volatiles may be beneficial, as volatile blends are more reliable indicators of future stress than single cues.","Plants can use induced volatiles to detect herbivore- and pathogen-attacked neighbors and prime their defenses.

10.1371/journal.pone.0191997,A test for clinal variation in Artemisia californica and associated arthropod responses to nitrogen addition.,"The response of plant traits to global change is of fundamental importance to understanding anthropogenic impacts on natural systems. Nevertheless, little is known about plant genetic variation in such responses or the indirect effect of environmental change on higher trophic levels. In a three-year common garden experiment, we grew the shrub Artemisia californica from five populations sourced along a 700 km latitudinal gradient under ambient and nitrogen (N) addition (20 kg N ha-1) and measured plant traits and associated arthropods. N addition increased plant biomass to a similar extent among all populations. In contrast, N addition effects on most other plant traits varied among plant populations; N addition reduced specific leaf area and leaf percent N and increased carbon to nitrogen ratios in the two northern populations, but had the opposite or no effect on the three southern populations. N addition increased arthropod abundance to a similar extent among all populations in parallel with an increase in plant biomass, suggesting that N addition did not alter plant resistance to herbivores. N addition had no effect on arthropod diversity, richness, or evenness. In summary, genetic variation among A. californica populations mediated leaf-trait responses to N addition, but positive direct effects of N addition on plant biomass and indirect effects on arthropod abundance were consistent among all populations.","The response of plant traits to global change is of fundamental importance to understanding anthropogenic impacts on natural systems.

N addition had no effect on arthropod diversity, richness, or evenness. In summary, genetic variation among A. californica populations mediated leaf-trait responses to N addition, but positive direct effects of N addition on plant biomass and indirect effects on arthropod abundance were consistent among all populations.",EuropePMC

10.1002/ece3.2416,Effect of different root endophytic fungi on plant community structure in experimental microcosms.,"Understanding the effects of root-associated microbes in explaining plant community patterns represents a challenge in community ecology. Although typically overlooked, several lines of evidence point out that nonmycorrhizal, root endophytic fungi in the Ascomycota may have the potential to drive changes in plant community ecology given their ubiquitous presence, wide host ranges, and plant species-specific fitness effects. Thus, we experimentally manipulated the presence of root endophytic fungal species in microcosms and measured its effects on plant communities. Specifically, we tested whether (1) three different root endophyte species can modify plant community structure; (2) those changes can also modified the way plant respond to different soil types; and (3) the effects are modified when all the fungi are present. As a model system, we used plant and fungal species that naturally co-occur in a temperate grassland. Further, the soil types used in our experiment reflected a strong gradient in soil texture that has been shown to drive changes in plant and fungal community structure in the field. Results showed that each plant species responded differently to infection, resulting in distinct patterns of plant community structure depending on the identity of the fungus present. Those effects depended on the soil type. For example, large positive effects due to presence of the fungi were able to compensate for less nutrients levels in one soil type. Further, host responses when all three fungi were present were different from the ones observed in single fungal inoculations, suggesting that endophyte-endophyte interactions may be important in structuring plant communities. Overall, these results indicate that plant responses to changes in the species identity of nonmycorrhizal fungal community species and their interactions can modify plant community structure.","Understanding the effects of root-associated microbes in explaining plant community patterns represents a challenge in community ecology.

10.1038/s41467-020-20786-w,SOX-5 activates a novel RORγt enhancer to facilitate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by promoting Th17 cell differentiation.,"T helper type 17 (Th17) cells have important functions in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Retinoid-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt) is necessary for Th17 cell differentiation and functions. However, the transcriptional regulation of RORγt expression, especially at the enhancer level, is still poorly understood. Here we identify a novel enhancer of RORγt gene in Th17 cells, RORCE2. RORCE2 deficiency suppresses RORγt expression and Th17 differentiation, leading to reduced severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Mechanistically, RORCE2 is looped to RORγt promoter through SRY-box transcription factor 5 (SOX-5) in Th17 cells, and the loss of SOX-5 binding site in RORCE abolishes RORCE2 function and affects the binding of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to the RORγt locus. Taken together, our data highlight a molecular mechanism for the regulation of Th17 differentiation and functions, which may represent a new intervening clue for Th17-related diseases.","T helper type 17 (Th17) cells have important functions in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

This fungus causes brown sectorial necrosis in wood which affect the vegetative growth. Despite intense research efforts made in the past years, no cure currently exists for this disease. Host responses to eutypa dieback are difficult to address because <i>E. lata</i> is a wood pathogen that causes foliar symptoms several years after infection. With the aim to classify the level of susceptibility of grapevine cultivars to the foliar symptoms caused by <i>E. lata</i>, artificial inoculations of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Ugni Blanc were conducted over 3 years. Merlot was the most tolerant cultivar, whereas Ugni Blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon exhibited higher and differential levels of susceptibility. We took advantage of their contrasting phenotypes to explore their defense responses, including the activation of pathogenesis-related (<i>PR</i>) genes, oxylipin and phenylpropanoid pathways and the accumulation of stilbenes. These analyses were carried out using the millicell system that enables the molecular dialogue between <i>E. lata</i> mycelium and grapevine leaves to take place without physical contact. Merlot responded to <i>E. lata</i> by inducing the expression of a large number of defense-related genes. On the contrary, Ugni Blanc failed to activate such defense responses despite being able to perceive the fungus. To gain insight into the role of carbon partitioning in <i>E. lata</i> infected grapevine, we monitored the expression of plant genes involved in sugar transport and cleavage, and measured invertase activities. Our results evidence a coordinated up-regulation of <i>VvHT5</i> and <i>VvcwINV</i> genes, and a stimulation of the cell wall invertase activity in leaves of Merlot elicited by <i>E. lata</i>, but not in Ugni Blanc. Altogether, this study indicates that the degree of cultivar susceptibility is associated with the activation of host defense responses, including extracellular sucrolytic machinery and hexose uptake during the grapevine/<i>E. lata</i> interaction. Given the role of these activities in governing carbon allocation through the plant, we postulate that the availability of sugar resources for either the host or the fungus is crucial for the outcome of the interaction.","<i>Eutypa lata</i> is the causal agent of eutypa dieback, one of the most destructive grapevine trunk disease that causes severe economic losses in vineyards worldwide.

Descriptive statistics and data on treatment effects were retrieved and summarized.<h4>Results</h4>The conservative approach has a success rate of around 60 % and is associated with shorter pain duration, reduced analgesic medication, faster resolution of the inflammation process, lower expenses and quicker return to work. On the other hand, medical treatment leads to high (up to 20 %) readmission rates and more often requires surgery. An operative approach is associated with higher treatment success rates (>90 %) and very a low mortality rate.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Based on the current body of evidence, the use of antibiotics for primary treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis cannot be routinely recommended.

10.3389/fmicb.2016.00004,Microbial Profiling of a Suppressiveness-Induced Agricultural Soil Amended with Composted Almond Shells.,"This study focused on the microbial profile present in an agricultural soil that becomes suppressive after the application of composted almond shells (AS) as organic amendments. For this purpose, we analyzed the functions and composition of the complex communities present in an experimental orchard of 40-year-old avocado trees, many of them historically amended with composted almond shells. The role of microbes in the suppression of Rosellinia necatrix, the causative agent of avocado white root rot, was determined after heat-treatment and complementation experiments with different types of soil. Bacterial and fungal profiles obtained from natural soil samples based on the 16S rRNA gene and ITS sequencing revealed slight differences among the amended (AS) and unamended (CT) soils. When the soil was under the influence of composted almond shells as organic amendments, an increase in Proteobacteria and Ascomycota groups was observed, as well as a reduction in Acidobacteria and Mortierellales. Complementary to these findings, functional analysis by GeoChip 4.6 confirmed these subtle differences, mainly present in the relative abundance of genes involved in the carbon cycle. Interestingly, a group of specific probes included in the ""soil benefit"" category was present only in AS-amended soils, corresponding to specific microorganisms previously described as potential biocontrol agents, such as Pseudomonas spp., Burkholderia spp., or Actinobacteria. Considering the results of both analyses, we determined that AS-amendments to the soil led to an increase in some orders of Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Dothideomycetes, as well as a reduction in the abundance of Xylariales fungi (where R. necatrix is allocated).

Sexual reproduction in this plant is an essential process, which determines the yield. Successful fertilization is mainly favored and sometimes needed of the presence of pollen grains from a different cultivar as the olive seizes a self-incompatibility system allegedly determined of the sporophytic type. The purpose of the present study was to identify key gene products involved in the function of olive pollen and pistil, in order to help elucidate the events and signaling processes, which happen during the courtship, pollen grain germination, and fertilization in olive. The use of subtractive SSH libraries constructed using, on the one hand one specific stage of the pistil development with germinating pollen grains, and on the other hand mature pollen grains may help to reveal the specific transcripts involved in the cited events. Such libraries have also been created by subtracting vegetative mRNAs (from leaves), in order to identify reproductive sequences only. A variety of transcripts have been identified in the mature pollen grains and in the pistil at the receptive stage. Among them, those related to defense, transport and oxidative metabolism are highlighted mainly in the pistil libraries where transcripts related to stress, and response to biotic and abiotic stimulus have a prominent position. Extensive lists containing information as regard to the specific transcripts determined for each stage and tissue are provided, as well as functional classifications of these gene products. Such lists were faced up to two recent datasets obtained in olive after transcriptomic and genomic approaches. The sequences and the differential expression level of the SSH-transcripts identified here, highly matched the transcriptomic information. Moreover, the unique presence of a representative number of these transcripts has been validated by means of qPCR approaches. The construction of SSH libraries using pistil and pollen, considering the high interaction between male-female counterparts, allowed the identification of transcripts with important roles in stigma physiology. The functions of many of the transcripts obtained are intimately related, and most of them are of pivotal importance in defense, pollen-stigma interaction and signaling.","The olive tree is a crop of high socio-economical importance in the Mediterranean area.

However, little is known about the molecular and genomic basis of defense response that insect herbivory trigger in cotton plants and how defense mechanisms are orchestrated in the context of other biological processes. Here we monitored the transcriptome changes and volatile characteristics of cotton plants in response to cotton bollworm (CBW; Helicoverpa armigera) larvae infestation. Analysis of samples revealed that 1,969 transcripts were differentially expressed (log2|Ratio| ≥ 2; q ≤ 0.05) after CBW infestation. Cluster analysis identified several distinct temporal patterns of transcriptome changes. Among CBW-induced genes, those associated with indirect defense and jasmonic acid pathway were clearly over-represented, indicating that these genes play important roles in CBW-induced defenses. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses revealed that CBW infestation could induce cotton plants to release volatile compounds comprised lipoxygenase-derived green leaf volatiles and a number of terpenoid volatiles. Responding to CBW larvae infestation, cotton plants undergo drastic reprogramming of the transcriptome and the volatile profile.

However, despite growing interest in multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs) as possible sources of exosomes, tethering of MVBs to the PM has not been reported. Here we show that MVBs and the vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) could be tethered to the PM (PM-MVB/TP tethering) by artificial protein fusions or bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) complexes that contain a peripheral membrane protein that binds the PM and also a protein that binds MVBs or the tonoplast. PM-binding proteins capable of participating in PM-MVB/TP tethering included StRem1.3, BIK1, PBS1, CPK21, and the PtdIns(4)-binding proteins FAPP1 and Osh2. MVB/TP-binding proteins capable of participating in tethering included ARA6, ARA7, RHA1, RABG3f, and the PtdIns(3)P-binding proteins Vam7p and Hrs-2xFYVE. BiFC complexes or protein fusions capable of producing PM-MVB/TP tethering were visualized as large well-defined patches of fluorescence on the PM that could displace PM proteins such as AtFlotillin1 and also could displace cytoplasmic proteins such as soluble GFP. Furthermore, we identified paralogous ubiquitin E3 ligase proteins, SAUL1 (AtPUB44), and AtPUB43 that could produce PM-MVB/TP tethering.

In this study, the distribution of DON in the wheat kernel and the effect of exposure time to ozone on DON detoxification were investigated. A high concentration of toxin was found in the outer part of the kernel, and DON was injected from the outside to the inside. The degradation rates of DON were 26.40%, 39.16%, and 53.48% after the samples were exposed to 75 mg/L ozone for 30, 60, and 90 min, respectively. The effect of ozonation on wheat flour quality and nutrition was also evaluated. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were found in protein content, fatty acid value, amino acid content, starch content, carbonyl and carboxyl content, and swelling power of ozone-treated samples. Moreover, the ozone-treated samples exhibited higher tenacity and whiteness, as well as lower extensibility and yellowness. This finding indicated that ozone treatment can simultaneously reduce DON levels and improve flour quality.","Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a secondary metabolite produced by Fusarium fungi, which is found in a wide range of agricultural products, especially in wheat, barley, oat and corn.

10.3389/fmicb.2018.00827,Genomic Organization and Expression of Iron Metabolism Genes in the Emerging Pathogenic Mold <i>Scedosporium apiospermum</i>.,"The ubiquitous mold <i>Scedosporium apiospermum</i> is increasingly recognized as an emerging pathogen, especially among patients with underlying disorders such as immunodeficiency or cystic fibrosis (CF). Indeed, it ranks the second among the filamentous fungi colonizing the respiratory tract of CF patients. However, our knowledge about virulence factors of this fungus is still limited. The role of iron-uptake systems may be critical for establishment of <i>Scedosporium</i> infections, notably in the iron-rich environment of the CF lung. Two main strategies are employed by fungi to efficiently acquire iron from their host or from their ecological niche: siderophore production and reductive iron assimilation (RIA) systems. The aim of this study was to assess the existence of orthologous genes involved in iron metabolism in the recently sequenced genome of <i>S. apiospermum</i>. At first, a tBLASTn analysis using <i>A. fumigatus</i> iron-related proteins as query revealed orthologs of almost all relevant loci in the <i>S. apiospermum</i> genome. Whereas the genes putatively involved in RIA were randomly distributed, siderophore biosynthesis and transport genes were organized in two clusters, each containing a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) whose orthologs in <i>A. fumigatus</i> have been described to catalyze hydroxamate siderophore synthesis. Nevertheless, comparative genomic analysis of siderophore-related clusters showed greater similarity between <i>S. apiospermum</i> and phylogenetically close molds than with <i>Aspergillus</i> species. The expression level of these genes was then evaluated by exposing conidia to iron starvation and iron excess. The expression of several orthologs of <i>A. fumigatus</i> genes involved in siderophore-based iron uptake or RIA was significantly induced during iron starvation, and conversely repressed in iron excess conditions. Altogether, these results indicate that <i>S. apiospermum</i> possesses the genetic information required for efficient and competitive iron uptake. They also suggest an important role of the siderophore production system in iron uptake by <i>S. apiospermum</i>.","The ubiquitous mold <i>Scedosporium apiospermum</i> is increasingly recognized as an emerging pathogen, especially among patients with underlying disorders such as immunodeficiency or cystic fibrosis (CF). Indeed, it ranks the second among the filamentous fungi colonizing the respiratory tract of CF patients. However, our knowledge about virulence factors of this fungus is still limited. The role of iron-uptake systems may be critical for establishment of <i>Scedosporium</i> infections, notably in the iron-rich environment of the CF lung. Two main strategies are employed by fungi to efficiently acquire iron from their host or from their ecological niche: siderophore production and reductive iron assimilation (RIA) systems. The aim of this study was to assess the existence of orthologous genes involved in iron metabolism in the recently sequenced genome of <i>S. apiospermum</i>. At first, a tBLASTn analysis using <i>A. fumigatus</i> iron-related proteins as query revealed orthologs of almost all relevant loci in the <i>S. apiospermum</i> genome. Whereas the genes putatively involved in RIA were randomly distributed, siderophore biosynthesis and transport genes were organized in two clusters, each containing a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) whose orthologs in <i>A. fumigatus</i> have been described to catalyze hydroxamate siderophore synthesis. Nevertheless, comparative genomic analysis of siderophore-related clusters showed greater similarity between <i>S. apiospermum</i> and phylogenetically close molds than with <i>Aspergillus</i> species. The expression level of these genes was then evaluated by exposing conidia to iron starvation and iron excess. The expression of several orthologs of <i>A. fumigatus</i> genes involved in siderophore-based iron uptake or RIA was significantly induced during iron starvation, and conversely repressed in iron excess conditions.

,Effect of Infection by Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae on the Feeding of Uvarovistia zebra,"To identify the susceptibility of long-horned grasshoppers to entomopathogenic fungi, the effect of infection with the fungi Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) and Metarhizium anisopliae (Metchnikoff) Sorokin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) on food consumption by Uvarovistia zebra (Uvarov) (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) was investigated. Preliminary results showed that both fungi had a negative effect on food consumption of the insects. For both fungi a significant reduction of food consumption and faeces production by insects were observed between the highest spore concentration (5 × 106 spores/ml) and other treatments. Compared with control insects, the insects treated with 5 × 106 spores/ml of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae showed 60 and 63% reduction in mean food consumption/insect, respectively. The corrected cumulative percent mortality of the insects treated with the highest concentration of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae were 57.7 and 55.5%, respectively. This was the first account of these entomopathogenic fungi being used against a species from this family, therefore based on the results obtained from this research, it could be said that the fungi have pathogenicity effect on U. zebra as a long-horned grasshopper.","To identify the susceptibility of long-horned grasshoppers to entomopathogenic fungi, the effect of infection with the fungi Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) and Metarhizium anisopliae (Metchnikoff) Sorokin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) on food consumption by Uvarovistia zebra (Uvarov) (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) was investigated.

With the advent of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to mobilize neutrophils in healthy donors, granulocyte transfusions have been broadly used to prevent and/or treat life-threatening infections in patients with severe febrile neutropenia and/or neutrophil dysfunction. Although the results of randomized controlled trials are inconclusive, there are suggestions from pilot and retrospective studies that granulocyte transfusions may benefit selected categories of patients. We will critically appraise the evidence related to the use of therapeutic granulocyte transfusions in children and adults, highlighting current controversies in the field and discussing complementary approaches to modulate phagocyte function in the host.","Bacterial and fungal infections continue to pose a major clinical challenge in patients with prolonged severe neutropenia after chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

10.1371/journal.pone.0188620,Tetrahydrocarbazoles are a novel class of potent P-type ATPase inhibitors with antifungal activity.,"We have identified a series of tetrahydrocarbazoles as novel P-type ATPase inhibitors. Using a set of rationally designed analogues, we have analyzed their structure-activity relationship using functional assays, crystallographic data and computational modeling. We found that tetrahydrocarbazoles inhibit adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis of the fungal H+-ATPase, depolarize the fungal plasma membrane and exhibit broad-spectrum antifungal activity. Comparative inhibition studies indicate that many tetrahydrocarbazoles also inhibit the mammalian Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and Na+,K+-ATPase with an even higher potency than Pma1. We have located the binding site for this compound class by crystallographic structure determination of a SERCA-tetrahydrocarbazole complex to 3.0 Å resolution, finding that the compound binds to a region above the ion inlet channel of the ATPase. A homology model of the Candida albicans H+-ATPase based on this crystal structure, indicates that the compounds could bind to the same pocket and identifies pocket extensions that could be exploited for selectivity enhancement. The results of this study will aid further optimization towards selective H+-ATPase inhibitors as a new class of antifungal agents.","We have identified a series of tetrahydrocarbazoles as novel P-type ATPase inhibitors.

Powdery mildews only invade the epidermal cell layer of leaf tissues, in which they form haustorial structures. Haustoria are at the center of the biotrophic interaction by taking up nutrients from the host and by delivering effectors in the invaded cells to jeopardize plant immunity. Haustoria are composed of a fungal core delimited by a haustorial plasma membrane and cell wall. Surrounding these is the extrahaustorial complex, of which the extrahaustorial membrane is of plant origin. Although haustoria transcriptomes and proteomes have been investigated for <i>Blumeria</i>, the proteomes of barley epidermis upon infection and the barley components of the extrahaustorial complex remains unexplored. When comparing proteomes of infected and non-infected epidermis, several classical pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins were more abundant in infected epidermis. These included peroxidases, chitinases, cysteine-rich venom secreted proteins/PR1 and two thaumatin-like PR5 protein isoforms, of which TLP5 was previously shown to interact with the <i>Blumeria</i> effector BEC1054 (CSEP0064). Against expectations, transient <i>TLP5</i> gene silencing suggested that TLP5 does not contribute to resistance but modulates susceptibility towards <i>B. graminis</i>. In a second proteomics comparison, haustorial structures were enriched from infected epidermal strips to identify plant proteins closely associated with the extrahaustorial complex. In these haustoria-enriched samples, relative abundances were higher for several V-type ATP synthase/ATPase subunits, suggesting the generation of proton gradients in the extrahaustorial space. Other haustoria-associated proteins included secreted or membrane proteins such as a PIP2 aquaporin, an early nodulin-like protein 9, an aspartate protease and other proteases, a lipase, and a lipid transfer protein, all of which are potential modulators of immunity, or the targets of pathogen effectors. Moreover, the ER BIP-like HSP70, may link ER stress responses and the idea of ER-like properties previously attributed to the extrahaustorial membrane. This initial investigation exploring the barley proteomes of <i>Blumeria</i>-infected tissues and haustoria, associated with a transient gene silencing approach, is invaluable to gain first insight of key players of resistance and susceptibility.","Powdery mildews are biotrophic pathogens causing fungal diseases in many economically important crops, including cereals, which are affected by <i>Blumeria graminis</i>.

10.1186/s12951-015-0147-8,Effect of silver nanoparticles on Candida albicans biofilms: an ultrastructural study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Candida albicans is the most common pathogenic fungus isolated in bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients, and candidiasis represents the fourth most common infection in United States hospitals, mostly due to the increasing numbers of immune- and medically-compromised patients. C. albicans has the ability to form biofilms and morphogenetic conversions between yeast and hyphal morphologies contribute to biofilm development and represent an essential virulence factor. Moreover, these attached communities of cells are surrounded by a protective exopolymeric matrix that effectively shelters Candida against the action of antifungals. Because of dismal outcomes, novel antifungal strategies, and in particular those targeting biofilms are urgently required. As fungi are eukaryotic, research and development of new antifungal agents has been difficult due to the limited number of selective targets, also leading to toxicity.<h4>Results</h4>By microwave-assisted techniques we obtained pure 1 nm spherical silver nanoparticles ideal for their potential biological applications without adding contaminants. A phenotypic assay of C. albicans demonstrated a potent dose-dependent inhibitory effect of silver nanoparticles on biofilm formation, with an IC50 of 0.089 ppm. Also silver nanoparticles demonstrated efficacy when tested against pre-formed C. albicans biofilms resulting in an IC50 of 0.48 ppm. The cytotoxicity assay resulted in a CC50 of 7.03 ppm. The ultrastructural differences visualized under SEM with silver nanoparticles treatment were changes in the surface appearance of the yeast from smooth to rough thus indicating outer cell wall damage. On the fungal pre-formed biofilm true hyphae was mostly absent, as filamentation was inhibited. TEM measurement of the cell-wall width of C. albicans after treatment resulted in significant enlargement (206  ±  11 nm) demonstrating membrane permeabilization.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results demonstrate that silver nanoparticles are potent inhibitors of C. albicans biofilm formation. SEM observations are consistent with an overall loss of structure of biofilms mostly due to disruption of the outer cell membrane/wall and inhibition of filamentation.TEM indicates the permeabilization of the cell wall and subsequent disruption of the structural layers of the outer fungal cell wall. The anti-biofilm effects are via cell wall disruption.","<h4>Background</h4>Candida albicans is the most common pathogenic fungus isolated in bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients, and candidiasis represents the fourth most common infection in United States hospitals, mostly due to the increasing numbers of immune- and medically-compromised patients.

However, the molecular mechanisms of how the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and host plant association on atrazine stress were still poorly understood. To better characterize how arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and host plant interactions increase atrazine stress, we performed physiological and proteomic analysis of Funneliformis mosseae (mycorrhizal fungi) and Medicago sativa (alfalfa) association under atrazine stress.<h4>Results</h4>The results showed that in the Arbuscular mycorrhizal, protective enzymes were up regulated and the malondialdehyde content increased relative to those of non-mycorrhizal M.sativa. We also examined the atrazine degradation rates within the nutrient solution, and a 44.43% reduction was observed with the mycorrhizal M.sativa, with 30.83% of the reduction attributed to F. mosseae. The accumulation content in root and stem of mycorrhizal M.sativa were obviously increased 11.89% and 16.33% than those of non- mycorrhizal M.sativa. The activity of PPO, POD, CAT and SOD in mycorrhizal M.sativa were obviously higher than non mycorrhizal M.sativa under atrazine stess. We identified differential root proteins using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantization coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, with 533 proteins identified (276 unregulated and 257 downregulated). The differentially expressed proteins were further examined using GO, BLAST comparisons, and a literature inquiry and were classified into the categories of atrazine degradation (37.1%); atrazine stress response (28.6%); plant immune responses (14.3%); translation, synthesis, and processing (10%); and signal transduction and biological processes (10%). Furthermore, we identified glycosyl transferase, glutathione S-transferase, laccase, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, peroxidase, and other proteins closely related to the degradation process.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Mycorrhizal Medicago showed improved atrazine degradation within the culturing medium and increased atrazine enrichment in the roots and stems. Additionally, AMF increased the plant root response to atrazine, with relevant enzymes up regulated and toxic effects alleviated. Overall, the findings of this study show that AMF played an important role in easing atrazine stress in plants and contributed to atrazine remediation and further contributed to the understanding of the molecular mechanism associated with atrazine stresses and potential mycorrhizal contributions in M.sativa.","<h4>Background</h4>Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form symbiotic associations with host plants can protect host plants against diverse biotic and abiotic stresses, and promote biodegradation of various contaminants.

Here, we show that in a social insect, the ant <i>Lasius neglectus</i>, the negative consequences of fungal infections (<i>Metarhizium brunneum</i>) can be mitigated by employing an efficient multicomponent behaviour, termed destructive disinfection, which prevents further spread of the disease through the colony. Ants specifically target infected pupae during the pathogen's non-contagious incubation period, utilising chemical 'sickness cues' emitted by pupae. They then remove the pupal cocoon, perforate its cuticle and administer antimicrobial poison, which enters the body and prevents pathogen replication from the inside out. Like the immune system of a metazoan body that specifically targets and eliminates infected cells, ants destroy infected brood to stop the pathogen completing its lifecycle, thus protecting the rest of the colony. Hence, in an analogous fashion, the same principles of disease defence apply at different levels of biological organisation.","In social groups, infections have the potential to spread rapidly and cause disease outbreaks.

Overexpression of OsTPS19 in rice plants enhanced resistance against M. oryzae, while OsTPS19 RNAi lines were more susceptible to the pathogen. Metabolic analysis revealed that the production of a monoterpene (S)-limonene was increased and decreased in OsTPS19 overexpression and RNAi lines, respectively, suggesting that OsTPS19 functions as a limonene synthase in planta. This notion was further supported by in vitro enzyme assays with recombinant OsTPS19, in which OsTPS19 had both sesquiterpene activity and monoterpene synthase activity, with limonene as a major product. Furthermore, in a subcellular localization experiment, OsTPS19 was localized in plastids. OsTPS19 has a highly homologous paralog, OsTPS20, which likely resulted from a recent gene duplication event. We found that the variation in OsTPS19 and OsTPS20 enzyme activities was determined by a single amino acid in the active site cavity.

Our analyses support independent gains of bioluminescence in fireflies and click beetles, and provide new insights into the genes, chemical defenses, and symbionts that evolved alongside their luminous lifestyle.",EuropePMC

Two Cochrane systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have reported that topical treatments for dry mouth and dry eye are safe and effective. Ocular cyclosporine A was safe and effective in two RCTs including 1039 patients with dry eye syndrome. Two Cochrane SLRs on serum tear drops and plugs showed inconsistency in possible benefits, both for symptoms and objective measures. Five RCTs reported significant improvements in oral dryness and salivary flow rates for pilocarpine and cevimeline. An RCT showed no significant placebo-differences for hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day for the primary outcome (visual analogue scale (VAS) composite of dryness, fatigue and pain). We identified seven RCTs carried out in primary SjS patients. RCTs using infliximab, anakinra and baminercept found no placebo-differences for the primary outcomes. The two largest RCTs randomised 255 patients to receive rituximab or placebo and reported no significant results in the primary outcome (VAS composite), while prospective studies suggested efficacy in systemic disease.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current evidence supporting the use of the main topical therapeutic options of primary SjS is solid, while limited data from RCTs are available to guide systemic therapies.","<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate current evidence on the efficacy and safety of topical and systemic medications in patients with primary Sjögren syndrome (SjS) to inform European League Against Rheumatism treatment recommendations.<h4>Methods</h4>The MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for case-control/prospective cohort studies, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews.<h4>Results</h4>Current evidence in primary SjS patients fulfilling the 2002 criteria is based on the data from 9 RCTs, 18 prospective cohort studies and 5 case-control studies.

10.1371/journal.pone.0197840,Analysis of the resistance mechanisms in sugarcane during Sporisorium scitamineum infection using RNA-seq and microscopy.,"Smut caused by biotrophic fungus Sporisorium scitamineum is a major disease of cultivated sugarcane that can cause considerable yield losses. It has been suggested in literature that there are at least two types of resistance mechanisms in sugarcane plants: an external resistance, due to chemical or physical barriers in the sugarcane bud, and an internal resistance governed by the interaction of plant and fungus within the plant tissue. Detailed molecular studies interrogating these two different resistance mechanisms in sugarcane are scarce. Here, we use light microscopy and global expression profiling with RNA-seq to investigate these mechanisms in sugarcane cultivar CP74-2005, a cultivar that possibly possesses both internal and external defence mechanisms. A total of 861 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in a comparison between infected and non-infected buds at 48 hours post-inoculation (hpi), with 457 (53%) genes successfully annotated using BLAST2GO software. This includes genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway, cell wall biosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction and disease resistance genes. Finally, the expression of 13 DEGs with putative roles in S. scitamineum resistance were confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, and the results were consistent with the RNA-seq data. These results highlight that the early sugarcane response to S. scitamineum infection is complex and many of the disease response genes are attenuated in sugarcane cultivar CP74-2005, while others, like genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway, are induced. This may point to the role of the different disease resistance mechanisms that operate in cultivars such as CP74-2005, whereby the early response is dominated by external mechanisms and then as the infection progresses, the internal mechanisms are switched on. Identification of genes underlying resistance in sugarcane will increase our knowledge of the sugarcane-S. scitamineum interaction and facilitate the introgression of new resistance genes into commercial sugarcane cultivars.","Smut caused by biotrophic fungus Sporisorium scitamineum is a major disease of cultivated sugarcane that can cause considerable yield losses.

10.1186/s12284-019-0287-9,Comparative study of the mycorrhizal root transcriptomes of wild and cultivated rice in response to the pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae.,"<h4>Background</h4>Rice, which serves as a staple food for more than half of the world's population, is very susceptible to the pathogenic fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. However, common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), which is the ancestor of Asian cultivated rice (O. sativa), has significant potential as a genetic source of resistance to M. oryzae. Recent studies have shown that the domestication of rice has altered its relationship to symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizae. A comparative response of wild and domestic rice inhabited by mycorrhizae to infection by M. oryzae has not been documented.<h4>Results</h4>In the current study, roots of wild and cultivated rice colonized with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus (AMF) Rhizoglomus intraradices were used to compare the transcriptomic responses of the two species to infection by M. oryzae. Phenotypic analysis indicated that the colonization of wild and cultivated rice with R. intraradices improved the resistance of both genotypes to M. oryzae. Wild AM rice, however, was more resistant to M. oryzae than the cultivated AM rice, as well as nonmycorrhizal roots of wild rice. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the mechanisms regulating the responses of wild and cultivated AM rice to M. oryzae invasion were significantly different. The expression of a greater number of genes was changed in wild AM rice than in cultivated AM rice in response to the pathogen. Both wild and cultivated AM rice exhibited a shared response to M. oryzae which included genes related to the auxin and salicylic acid pathways; all of these play important roles in pathogenesis-related protein synthesis. In wild AM rice, secondary metabolic and biotic stress-related analyses indicated that the jasmonic acid synthesis-related α-linolenic acid pathway, the phenolic and terpenoid pathways, as well as the phenolic and terpenoid syntheses-related mevalonate (MVA) pathway were more affected by the pathogen. Genes related to these pathways were more significantly enriched in wild AM rice than in cultivated AM rice in response to M. oryzae. On the other hand, genes associated with the 'brassinosteroid biosynthesis' were more enriched in cultivated AM rice.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The AMF R. intraradices-colonized rice plants exhibited greater resistance to M. oryzae than non-AMF-colonized plants. The findings of the current study demonstrate the potential effects of crop domestication on the benefits received by the host via root colonization with AMF(s), and provide new information on the underlying molecular mechanisms. In addition, results of this study can also help develop guidelines for the applications of AMF(s) when planting rice.","<h4>Background</h4>Rice, which serves as a staple food for more than half of the world's population, is very susceptible to the pathogenic fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae.

The present experiment was designed to study the maternal persistent effects of zearalenone toxicity in gestating sows on growth and muscle development of their offsprings, and the alleviation of zearalenone toxicity by modified halloysite nanotubes (MHNTs).<h4>Methods</h4>Eighteen sows were fed with one of three dietary treatments that included the following: (1) a control diet, (2) a contaminated grain diet (with 50 % moldy corn, 2.77 mg/kg ZEN), and (3) a contaminated grain diet (with 50 % moldy corn, 2.76 mg/kg ZEN) + 1 % MHNTs. Each sow was exclusively fed its experimental diets from 35 to 70 d of gestation at a total of 2 kg daily. Muscle samples were collected from six piglets per treatment at birth, weaning and finishing.<h4>Results</h4>The results showed that feeding the sows with the ZEN-contaminated diets from 35 to 70 d of gestation decreased the ADG, ADFI and G:F of their offsprings (P < 0.05). The muscle fiber numbers in the newborn, weaning and growing-finishing pigs and the muscle fiber diameters at birth and weaning were also decreased by maternal ZEN exposure (P < 0.05). The expressions of IGF-I, IGF-II, Myf-5 and Mstn at birth and IGF-II, Pax7, Myf-5 and MyoD1 at weaning were altered by feeding gestating sows with ZEN-contaminated diets (P < 0.05). The MHNTs reduced most of the ZEN-induced toxic effects: the ADG and ADFI on growth performance, the muscle fiber numbers at weaning and finishing and the muscle fiber diameters at weaning (P < 0.05). The expression levels of IGF-II and Mstn in newborn piglets and IGF-II and Myf-5 in weaning piglets were also prevented by adding 1 % MHNTs (P < 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The present study demonstrated that the offsprings of sows fed with ZEN-contaminated diets from 35 to 70 day of gestation exhibited weakening on growth performance, physiological changes in their muscle fibers and alterations of mRNA expression in their muscle tissues, and also indicated that MHNTs prevented most of the ZEN-induced weakening in the muscle tissues.","<h4>Background</h4>Zearalenone (ZEN) is an estrogenic mycotoxin that is primarily produced by Fusarium fungi and has been proven to affect the reproductive capacity of many species to varying degrees.

10.1371/journal.ppat.1004643,Recognition of Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae by human plasmacytoid dendritic cells is mediated by dectin-2 and results in formation of extracellular traps.,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) were initially considered as critical for innate immunity to viruses. However, our group has shown that pDCs bind to and inhibit the growth of Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae and that depletion of pDCs renders mice hypersusceptible to experimental aspergillosis. In this study, we examined pDC receptors contributing to hyphal recognition and downstream events in pDCs stimulated by A. fumigatus hyphae. Our data show that Dectin-2, but not Dectin-1, participates in A. fumigatus hyphal recognition, TNF-α and IFN-α release, and antifungal activity. Moreover, Dectin-2 acts in cooperation with the FcRγ chain to trigger signaling responses. In addition, using confocal and electron microscopy we demonstrated that the interaction between pDCs and A. fumigatus induced the formation of pDC extracellular traps (pETs) containing DNA and citrullinated histone H3. These structures closely resembled those of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The microarray analysis of the pDC transcriptome upon A. fumigatus infection also demonstrated up-regulated expression of genes associated with apoptosis as well as type I interferon-induced genes. Thus, human pDCs directly recognize A. fumigatus hyphae via Dectin-2; this interaction results in cytokine release and antifungal activity. Moreover, hyphal stimulation of pDCs triggers a distinct pattern of pDC gene expression and leads to pET formation.","Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) were initially considered as critical for innate immunity to viruses.

When foraging in host habitats infested with entomopathogenic fungi that can infect both a parasitoid and its host, parasitoids may reduce the risk of intraguild predation (IGP) by avoiding such patches. In this study, we examined whether the presence of the entomopathogenic fungi Metarhizium brunneum and Beauveria bassiana in soil habitats of a root herbivore, Delia radicum, affects the behavior of Trybliographa rapae, a parasitoid of D. radicum. Olfactometer bioassays revealed that T. rapae avoided fungal infested host habitats and that this was dependent on fungal species and density. In particular, the parasitoid avoided habitats with high densities of the more virulent fungus, M. brunneum. In addition, host density was found to be important for the attraction of T. rapae. Volatiles collected from host habitats revealed different compound profiles depending on fungal presence and density, which could explain the behavior of T. rapae. We conclude that T. rapae females may use volatile compounds to locate high densities of prey, but also compounds related to fungal presence to reduce the risk of IGP towards themselves and their offspring.","To locate and evaluate host patches before oviposition, parasitoids of herbivorous insects utilize plant volatiles and host-derived cues, but also evaluate predator-derived infochemicals to reduce predation risks.

This study was conducted to determine the toxicity, mechanism of action and the binding interaction of three active phenylpropanoids from Piper sarmentosum (Piperaceae) toward late 3rd or early 4th larvae of above vectors. A bioassay guided-fractionation on the hexane extract from the roots of Piper sarmentosum led to the isolation and identification of three active phenylpropanoids; asaricin 1, isoasarone 2 and trans-asarone 3. The current study involved evaluation of the toxicity and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition of these compounds against Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus larvae. Asaricin 1 and isoasarone 2 were highly potent against Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus larvae causing up to 100% mortality at ≤ 15 μg/mL concentration. The ovicidal activity of asaricin 1, isoasarone 2 and trans-asarone 3 were evaluated through egg hatching. Asaricin 1 and isoasarone 2 showed potent ovicidal activity. Ovicidal activity for both compounds was up to 95% at 25μg/mL. Asaricin 1 and isoasarone 2 showed strong inhibition on acetylcholinesterase with relative IC50 values of 0.73 to 1.87 μg/mL respectively. These findings coupled with the high AChE inhibition may suggest that asaricin 1 and isoasarone 2 are neuron toxic compounds toward Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus. Further computational docking with Autodock Vina elaborates the possible interaction of asaricin 1 and isoasarone 2 with three possible binding sites of AChE which includes catalytic triads (CAS: S238, E367, H480), the peripheral sites (PAS: E72, W271) and anionic binding site (W83).

The hypopigmentation effects of QCGG were determined by examination of cellular melanin contents, tyrosinase activity assay, cAMP assay, and Western blotting of α-MSH-stimulated B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. Our results showed that QCGG inhibited both melanin synthesis and tyrosinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner as well as significantly reduced the expression of melanogenic proteins such as microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase-related protein-1, tyrosinase-related protein-2, and tyrosinase. Moreover, QCGG inhibited intracellular cAMP levels, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and p38 MAPK expression in α-MSH-stimulated B16F10 cells.

Here, we present the results of our studies on the transcriptional response and the volatile compounds production of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) upon the large pine weevil (Hylobius abietis) feeding.<h4>Results</h4>Transcriptional response of Scots pine to the weevil attack was investigated using a novel customised 36.4 K Pinus taeda microarray. The weevil feeding caused large-scale changes in the pine transcriptome. In total, 774 genes were significantly up-regulated more than 4-fold (p≤0.05), whereas 64 genes were significantly down-regulated more than 4-fold. Among the up-regulated genes, we could identify genes involved in signal perception, signalling pathways, transcriptional regulation, plant hormone homeostasis, secondary metabolism and defence responses. The weevil feeding on stem bark of pine significantly increased the total emission of volatile organic compounds from the undamaged stem bark area. The emission levels of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were also increased. Interestingly, we could not observe any correlation between the increased production of the terpenoid compounds and expression levels of the terpene synthase-encoding genes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The obtained data provide an important insight into the transcriptional response of conifer trees to insect herbivory and illustrate the massive changes in the host transcriptome upon insect attacks. Moreover, many of the induced pathways are common between conifers and angiosperms. The presented results are the first ones obtained by the use of a microarray platform with an extended coverage of pine transcriptome (36.4 K cDNA elements). The platform will further facilitate the identification of resistance markers with the direct relevance for conifer tree breeding.","<h4>Background</h4>During their lifetime, conifer trees are exposed to numerous herbivorous insects.

These are excellent candidates for ecophysiology, being widely distributed across contrasting environments, having distinct domestication histories, from ancient <i>Lupinus albus</i> to recently domesticated <i>Lupinus angustifolius</i> and <i>Lupinus luteus</i>, facilitating the study of both natural and human selection. Strong trade-offs between seed size, early vigor and phenology were observed: vigor increasing, and flowering becoming earlier with increasing seed size. Despite large specific differences in all these traits, natural and human selection have operated in very similar ways in all 3 species. In wild material, as collection environments became drier and hotter, phenology became earlier, while seed size, early vigor and reproductive investment increased. Wild and domesticated germplasm separated along similar lines. Within similar habitats, domesticated material was consistently earlier, with larger seeds, greater early vigor and higher reproductive investment than wild, suggesting selection for both early establishment and timely maturity/drought escape in both domesticated and wild low rainfall ecotypes. Species differences reflected their distribution. Small and soft-seeded, low vigor <i>L. luteus</i> had a late, rainfall-responsive phenology specifically adapted to long season environments, and a narrow coastal distribution. <i>L. angustifolius</i> was much more conservative; more hard-seeded, flowering and maturing much earlier, with a wide Mediterranean distribution. <i>L. albus</i> flowered earlier but matured much later, with longer reproductive phases supporting much larger seed sizes and early vigor than either <i>L. luteus</i> or <i>L. angustifolius</i>.

10.1371/journal.pntd.0006237,Transformation of Fonsecaea pedrosoi into sclerotic cells links to the refractoriness of experimental chromoblastomycosis in BALB/c mice via a mechanism involving a chitin-induced impairment of IFN-γ production.,"Fonsecaea pedrosoi (F. pedrosoi) is the most common agent of chromoblastomycosis. Transformation of this fungus from its saprophytic phase into pathogenic sclerotic cells in tissue is an essential link to the refractoriness of this infection. Experimental studies in murine models have shown that the absence of CD4+ T cells impairs host defense against F. pedrosoi infection. Clinical research has also suggested that a relatively low level of the Th1 cytokine INF-γ and inefficient T cell proliferation are simultaneously present in patients with severe chromoblastomycosis upon in vitro stimulation with ChromoAg, an antigen prepared from F. pedrosoi. In the present study, we show that in mice intraperitoneally infected with F. pedrosoi-spores, -hyphae or in vitro-induced sclerotic cells respectively, the transformation of this causative agent into sclerotic cells contributes to a compromised Th1 cytokine production in the earlier stage of infection with impaired generation of neutrophil reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pan-inhibition of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine production with disseminated infection in the later stage by using a CBA murine Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine kit. In addition, we have further demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of recombinant mouse IFN-γ (rmIFN-γ) effectively reduces the fungal load in the infected mouse spleen, and dampens the peritoneal dissemination of F. pedrosoi-sclerotic cells. Meanwhile, exogeneous rmIFN-γ contributes to the formation and maintenance of micro-abscess and restores the decrease in neutrophil ROS generation in the mouse spleen infected with F. pedrosoi-sclerotic cells. Of note, we have once again demonstrated that it is a chitin-like component, but not β-glucans or mannose moiety, that exclusively accumulates on the outer cell wall of F. pedrosoi-sclerotic cells which were induced in vitro or isolated from the spleens of intraperitoneally infected BALB/c mice. In addition, our results indicate that decreased accumulation of chitin on the surface of live F. pedrosoi-sclerotic cells after chitinase treatment can be self-compensated in a time-dependent manner. Importantly, we have for the first time demonstrated that exclusive accumulation of chitin on the transformed sclerotic cells of F. pedrosoi is involved in an impaired murine Th1 cytokine profile, therefore promoting the refractoriness of experimental murine chromoblastomycosis.","Fonsecaea pedrosoi (F. pedrosoi) is the most common agent of chromoblastomycosis.

10.1371/journal.pmed.1001782,The role of Abcb5 alleles in susceptibility to haloperidol-induced toxicity in mice and humans.,"<h4>Background</h4>We know very little about the genetic factors affecting susceptibility to drug-induced central nervous system (CNS) toxicities, and this has limited our ability to optimally utilize existing drugs or to develop new drugs for CNS disorders. For example, haloperidol is a potent dopamine antagonist that is used to treat psychotic disorders, but 50% of treated patients develop characteristic extrapyramidal symptoms caused by haloperidol-induced toxicity (HIT), which limits its clinical utility. We do not have any information about the genetic factors affecting this drug-induced toxicity. HIT in humans is directly mirrored in a murine genetic model, where inbred mouse strains are differentially susceptible to HIT. Therefore, we genetically analyzed this murine model and performed a translational human genetic association study.<h4>Methods and findings</h4>A whole genome SNP database and computational genetic mapping were used to analyze the murine genetic model of HIT. Guided by the mouse genetic analysis, we demonstrate that genetic variation within an ABC-drug efflux transporter (Abcb5) affected susceptibility to HIT. In situ hybridization results reveal that Abcb5 is expressed in brain capillaries, and by cerebellar Purkinje cells. We also analyzed chromosome substitution strains, imaged haloperidol abundance in brain tissue sections and directly measured haloperidol (and its metabolite) levels in brain, and characterized Abcb5 knockout mice. Our results demonstrate that Abcb5 is part of the blood-brain barrier; it affects susceptibility to HIT by altering the brain concentration of haloperidol. Moreover, a genetic association study in a haloperidol-treated human cohort indicates that human ABCB5 alleles had a time-dependent effect on susceptibility to individual and combined measures of HIT. Abcb5 alleles are pharmacogenetic factors that affect susceptibility to HIT, but it is likely that additional pharmacogenetic susceptibility factors will be discovered.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ABCB5 alleles alter susceptibility to HIT in mouse and humans. This discovery leads to a new model that (at least in part) explains inter-individual differences in susceptibility to a drug-induced CNS toxicity.","<h4>Background</h4>We know very little about the genetic factors affecting susceptibility to drug-induced central nervous system (CNS) toxicities, and this has limited our ability to optimally utilize existing drugs or to develop new drugs for CNS disorders.

Here we show that elevated temperature significantly increases the susceptibility of Arabidopsis to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 independently of the phyB/PIF thermosensing pathway. Instead, elevated temperature promotes translocation of bacterial effector proteins into plant cells and causes a loss of ICS1-mediated salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis. Global transcriptome analysis reveals a major temperature-sensitive node of SA signalling, impacting ~60% of benzothiadiazole (BTH)-regulated genes, including ICS1 and the canonical SA marker gene, PR1. Remarkably, BTH can effectively protect Arabidopsis against Pst DC3000 infection at elevated temperature despite the lack of ICS1 and PR1 expression. Our results highlight the broad impact of a major climate condition on the enigmatic molecular interplay between temperature, SA defence and function of a central bacterial virulence system in the context of a widely studied susceptible plant-pathogen interaction.","Environmental conditions profoundly affect plant disease development; however, the underlying molecular bases are not well understood.

Existing evidence for the effectiveness of NPWT on postoperative wounds healing by primary closure remains uncertain.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the effects of NPWT for preventing SSI in wounds healing through primary closure, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of NPWT in wounds healing through primary closure.<h4>Search methods</h4>In June 2019, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries and references of included studies, systematic reviews and health technology reports. There were no restrictions on language, publication date or study setting.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included trials if they allocated participants to treatment randomly and compared NPWT with any other type of wound dressing, or compared one type of NPWT with another type of NPWT.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>At least two review authors independently assessed trials using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and quality assessment according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology.<h4>Main results</h4>In this third update, we added 15 new randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and three new economic studies, resulting in a total of 44 RCTs (7447 included participants) and five economic studies. Studies evaluated NPWT in the context of a wide range of surgeries including orthopaedic, obstetric, vascular and general procedures. Economic studies assessed NPWT in orthopaedic, obstetric and general surgical settings. All studies compared NPWT with standard dressings. Most studies had unclear or high risk of bias for at least one key domain. Primary outcomes Four studies (2107 participants) reported mortality. There is low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision) showing no clear difference in the risk of death after surgery for people treated with NPWT (2.3%) compared with standard dressings (2.7%) (risk ratio (RR) 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 1.47; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). Thirty-nine studies reported SSI; 31 of these (6204 participants), were included in meta-analysis. There is moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded once for risk of bias) that NPWT probably results in fewer SSI (8.8% of participants) than treatment with standard dressings (13.0% of participants) after surgery; RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.80 ; I<sup>2</sup> = 23%). Eighteen studies reported dehiscence; 14 of these (3809 participants) were included in meta-analysis. There is low-certainty evidence (downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision) showing no clear difference in the risk of dehiscence after surgery for NPWT (5.3% of participants) compared with standard dressings (6.2% of participants) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.13; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). Secondary outcomes There is low-certainty evidence showing no clear difference between NPWT and standard treatment for the outcomes of reoperation and incidence of seroma. For reoperation, the RR was 1.04 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.41; I<sup>2</sup> = 13%; 12 trials; 3523 participants); for seroma, the RR was 0.72 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.05; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; seven trials; 729 participants). The effect of NPWT on occurrence of haematoma or skin blisters is uncertain (very low-certainty evidence); for haematoma, the RR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.59; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; nine trials; 1202 participants) and for blisters the RR was 2.64 (95% CI 0.65 to 10.68; I<sup>2</sup> = 69%; seven trials; 796 participants). The overall effect of NPWT on pain is uncertain (very low-certainty evidence from seven trials (2218 participants) which reported disparate measures of pain); but moderate-certainty evidence suggests there is probably little difference between the groups in pain after three or six months following surgery for lower limb fracture (one trial, 1549 participants). There is also moderate-certainty evidence for women undergoing caesarean sections (one trial, 876 participants) and people having surgery for lower limb fractures (one trial, 1549 participants) that there is probably little difference in quality of life scores at 30 days or 3 or 6 months, respectively. Cost-effectiveness Five economic studies, based wholly or partially on trials included in our review, assessed the cost-effectiveness of NPWT compared with standard care. They considered NPWT in four indications: caesarean sections in obese women; surgery for lower limb fracture; knee/hip arthroplasty and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. They calculated quality-adjusted life-years for treatment groups and produced estimates of the treatments' relative cost-effectiveness. The reporting quality was good but the grade of the evidence varied from moderate to very low. There is moderate-certainty evidence that NPWT in surgery for lower limb fracture was not cost-effective at any threshold of willingness-to-pay and that NPWT is probably cost-effective in obese women undergoing caesarean section. Other studies found low or very low-certainty evidence indicating that NPWT may be cost-effective for the indications assessed.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>People experiencing primary wound closure of their surgical wound and treated prophylactically with NPWT following surgery probably experience fewer SSI than people treated with standard dressings (moderate-certainty evidence). There is no clear difference in number of deaths or wound dehiscence between people treated with NPWT and standard dressings (low-certainty evidence). There are also no clear differences in secondary outcomes where all evidence was low or very low-certainty. In caesarean section in obese women and surgery for lower limb fracture, there is probably little difference in quality of life scores (moderate-certainty evidence). Most evidence on pain is very low-certainty, but there is probably no difference in pain between NPWT and standard dressings after surgery for lower limb fracture (moderate-certainty evidence). Assessments of cost-effectiveness of NPWT produced differing results in different indications. There is a large number of ongoing studies, the results of which may change the findings of this review. Decisions about use of NPWT should take into account surgical indication and setting and consider evidence for all outcomes.","<h4>Background</h4>Indications for the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) are broad and include prophylaxis for surgical site infections (SSIs).

10.1186/s40814-017-0182-3,Pilot parallel randomised controlled trial of protective socks against usual care to reduce skin tears in high risk people: 'STOPCUTS'.,"<h4>Background</h4>Skin tears are common in older adults and those taking steroids and warfarin. They are traumatic, often blunt injuries caused by oblique knocks to the extremities. The epidermis may separate from the dermis or both layers from underlying tissues leaving a skin flap or total loss of tissue, which is painful and prone to infection. 'Dermatuff™' knee-length socks containing Kevlar fibres (used in stab-proof vests and motorcyclists' clothing) aim to prevent skin tears. The acceptability of the socks and the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) had not been explored.<h4>Methods</h4>In this pilot parallel group RCT, 90 people at risk of skin-tear injury from Devon care homes and primary care were randomised to receive the socks or treatment as usual (TAU). The pilot aimed to estimate parameters to inform the design of a substantive trial and record professionals' views and participants' acceptability of the intervention and of study participation.<h4>Results</h4>Participants were randomised from July 2013 and followed up until February 2015. Community participants were easier to recruit than care homes residents but were 10 years younger on average and more active. To recruit 90 participants, 395 had to be approached overall as 77% were excluded or declined. Seventy-nine participants (88%) completed the trial and 27/44 (61%) wore the socks for 16 weeks. There were 31 skin tear injuries affecting 18 (20%) of the 90 participants. The TAU group received more injuries, more repeated episodes, and larger tears with greater severity. Common daily diary reasons for not wearing the socks included perceived warmth in hot weather or not being available (holiday, in hospital, bed rest). Resource use data were obtainable and indicated that sock wearing gave a reduction in treatment costs whilst well-completed questionnaires showed improvements in secondary outcomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This pilot trial has successfully informed the design and conduct of a future definitive cost-effectiveness RCT. It would need to be conducted in primary care with 880 active at-risk, elderly patients (440 per arm). Skin tear incidence and quality of life (from EQ5D5L) over a 4-month period would be the primary and secondary outcomes respectively.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ISRCTN, ISRCTN96565376.","<h4>Background</h4>Skin tears are common in older adults and those taking steroids and warfarin.

10.1371/journal.pone.0175710,"Effect of quinoline based 1,2,3-triazole and its structural analogues on growth and virulence attributes of Candida albicans.","Candida albicans, along with some other non-albicans Candida species, is a group of yeast, which causes serious infections in humans that can be both systemic and superficial. Despite the fact that extensive efforts have been put into the discovery of novel antifungal agents, the frequency of these fungal infections has increased drastically worldwide. In our quest for the discovery of novel antifungal compounds, we had previously synthesized and screened quinoline containing 1,2,3-triazole (3a) as a potent Candida spp inhibitor. In the present study, two structural analogues of 3a (3b and 3c) have been synthesized to determine the role of quinoline and their anti-Candida activities have been evaluated. Preliminary results helped us to determine 3a and 3b as lead inhibitors. The IC50 values of compound 3a for C. albicans ATCC 90028 (standard) and C. albicans (fluconazole resistant) strains were 0.044 and 2.3 μg/ml, respectively while compound 3b gave 25.4 and 32.8 μg/ml values for the same strains. Disk diffusion, growth and time kill curve assays showed significant inhibition of C. albicans in the presence of compounds 3a and 3b. Moreover, 3a showed fungicidal nature while 3b was fungistatic. Both the test compounds significantly lower the secretion of proteinases and phospholipases. While, 3a inhibited proteinase secretion in C. albicans (resistant strain) by 45%, 3b reduced phospholipase secretion by 68% in C. albicans ATCC90028 at their respective MIC values. Proton extrusion and intracellular pH measurement studies suggested that both compounds potentially inhibit the activity of H+ ATPase, a membrane protein that is crucial for various cell functions. Similarly, 95-97% reduction in ergosterol content was measured in the presence of the test compounds at MIC and MIC/2. The study led to identification of two quinoline based potent inhibitors of C. albicans for further structural optimization and pharmacological investigation.","Candida albicans, along with some other non-albicans Candida species, is a group of yeast, which causes serious infections in humans that can be both systemic and superficial.

10.1002/ece3.1835,Limitation of seedling growth by potassium and magnesium supply for two ectomycorrhizal tree species of a Central African rain forest and its implication for their recruitment.,"In the ectomycorrhizal caesalpiniaceous groves of southern Korup National Park, the dominant tree species, Microberlinia bisulcata, displays very poor in situ recruitment compared with its codominant, Tetraberlinia bifoliolata. The reported ex situ experiment tested whether availabilities of soil potassium and magnesium play a role. Seedlings of the two species received applications of K and Mg fertilizer in potted native soil in a local shade house, and their responses in terms of growth and nutrient concentrations were recorded over 2 years. Amended soil concentrations were also determined. Microberlinia responded strongly and positively in its growth to Mg, but less to K; Tetraberlinia responded weakly to both. Added Mg led to strongly increased Mg concentration for Microberlinia while added K changed that concentration only slightly; Tetraberlinia strongly increased its concentration of K with added K, but only somewhat its Mg concentration with added Mg. Additions of Mg and K had small but important antagonistic effects. Microberlinia is Mg-demanding and apparently Mg-limited in Korup soil; Tetraberlinia, whilst K-demanding, appeared not to be K-limited (for growth). Added K enhanced plant P concentrations of both species. Extra applied Mg may also be alleviating soil aluminum toxicity, and hence improving growth indirectly and especially to the benefit of Microberlinia. Mg appears to be essential for Microberlinia seedling growth and its low soil availability in grove soils at Korup may be an important contributing factor to its poor recruitment. Microberlinia is highly shade-intolerant and strongly light-responding, whilst Tetraberlinia is more shade-tolerant and moderately light-responding, which affords an interesting contrast with respect to their differing responses to Mg supply. The study revealed novel aspects of functional traits and likely niche-partitioning among ectomycorrhizal caesalps in African rain forests. Identifying the direct and interacting indirect effects of essential elements on tropical tree seedling growth presents a considerable challenge due the complex nexus of causes involved.","In the ectomycorrhizal caesalpiniaceous groves of southern Korup National Park, the dominant tree species, Microberlinia bisulcata, displays very poor in situ recruitment compared with its codominant, Tetraberlinia bifoliolata.

The aim of this review is to summarize relevant information on new-onset AF in non-cardiac critical illness with respect to epidemiology, prevention, and treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a PubMed search in June 2014 and included studies describing the epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of new-onset AF and atrial flutter during ICU stay in non-cardiac adult patients. Selected studies were divided into the three categories according to the extracted information. The methodological quality of selected studies was described according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 1,132 citations, and after full-text-level selection, we included 10 studies on etiology/outcome and five studies on treatment. There was no study related to prevention. Overall quality of evidence was mostly low or very low due to their observational study designs, small sample sizes, flawed diagnosis of new-onset AF, and the absence of mortality evaluation. The incidence of new-onset AF varied from 4.5% to 15.0%, excluding exceptional cases (e.g., septic shock). Severity scores of patients with new-onset AF were higher than those without new-onset AF in eight studies, in four of which the difference was statistically significant. Five studies reported risk factors for new-onset AF, all of which used multivariate analyses to extract risk factors. Multiple risk factors are reported, e.g., advanced age, the white race, severity scores, organ failures, and sepsis. Hospital mortality in new-onset AF patients was higher than that of patients without AF in all studies, four of which found statistical significance. Among the five studies on treatment, only one study was randomized controlled, and various interventions were studied.<h4>Conclusions</h4>New-onset AF occurred in 5%-15% of the non-cardiac critically ill patients. Patients with new-onset AF had poor outcomes compared with those without AF. Despite the high incidence of new-onset AF in the general ICU population, currently available information for AF, especially for management (prevention, treatment, and anticoagulation), is quite limited. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of new-onset AF in critically ill patients.","<h4>Background</h4>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia in the ICU.

There are abundant components of spices and biomedicine at 550 °C pyrolyzates, while more spices and food additive at 700 °C pyrolyzates. At 550 °C, the content of biomedicine components reaches the highest by <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>Ag + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>NiO nanocatalysis, while the contents of spices and food additive components reach the highest by NiO nanocatalysis. At 700 °C, the content of bioenergy components reaches the highest by <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>Ag + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>NiO nanocatalysis, and the content of cosmetics components reaches the highest by Ag nanocatalysis. The findings suggested that the branch of the cold-acclimated <i>C. camphora</i> have the potential to develop into valued-added products of bioenergy, biomedicine, cosmetics, spices and food additive by nanocatalysis.",EuropePMC

10.1186/s13054-016-1324-3,Contribution of Candida biomarkers and DNA detection for the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis in ICU patients with severe abdominal conditions.,"<h4>Background</h4>To assess the performance of Candida albicans germ tube antibody (CAGTA), (1 → 3)-ß-D-glucan (BDG), mannan antigen (mannan-Ag), anti-mannan antibodies (mannan-Ab), and Candida DNA for diagnosing invasive candidiasis (IC) in ICU patients with severe abdominal conditions (SAC).<h4>Methods</h4>A prospective study of 233 non-neutropenic patients with SAC on ICU admission and expected stay ≥ 7 days. CAGTA (cutoff positivity ≥ 1/160), BDG (≥80, 100 and 200 pg/mL), mannan-Ag (≥60 pg/mL), mannan-Ab (≥10 UA/mL) were measured twice a week, and Candida DNA only in patients treated with systemic antifungals. IC diagnosis required positivities of two biomarkers in a single sample or positivities of any biomarker in two consecutive samples. Patients were classified as neither colonized nor infected (n = 48), Candida spp. colonization (n = 154) (low-grade, n = 130; high-grade, n = 24), and IC (n = 31) (intra-abdominal candidiasis, n = 20; candidemia, n = 11).<h4>Results</h4>The combination of CAGTA and BDG positivities in a single sample or at least one of the two biomarkers positive in two consecutive samples showed 90.3 % (95 % CI 74.2-98.0) sensitivity, 42.1 % (95 % CI 35.2-98.8) specificity, and 96.6 % (95 % CI 90.5-98.8) negative predictive value. BDG positivities in two consecutive samples had 76.7 % (95 % CI 57.7-90.1) sensitivity and 57.2 % (95 % CI 49.9-64.3) specificity. Mannan-Ag, mannan-Ab, and Candida DNA individually or combined showed a low discriminating capacity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Positive Candida albicans germ tube antibody and (1 → 3)-ß-D-glucan in a single blood sample or (1 → 3)-ß-D-glucan positivity in two consecutive blood samples allowed discriminating invasive candidiasis from Candida spp. colonization in critically ill patients with severe abdominal conditions. These findings may be helpful to tailor empirical antifungal therapy in this patient population.","<h4>Background</h4>To assess the performance of Candida albicans germ tube antibody (CAGTA), (1 → 3)-ß-D-glucan (BDG), mannan antigen (mannan-Ag), anti-mannan antibodies (mannan-Ab), and Candida DNA for diagnosing invasive candidiasis (IC) in ICU patients with severe abdominal conditions (SAC).<h4>Methods</h4>A prospective study of 233 non-neutropenic patients with SAC on ICU admission and expected stay ≥ 7 days.

10.1093/jxb/ery010,Transcriptional stimulation of rate-limiting components of the autophagic pathway improves plant fitness.,"Autophagy is a major catabolic process whereby autophagosomes deliver cytoplasmic content to the lytic compartment for recycling. Autophagosome formation requires two ubiquitin-like systems conjugating Atg12 with Atg5, and Atg8 with lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), respectively. Genetic suppression of these systems causes autophagy-deficient phenotypes with reduced fitness and longevity. We show that Atg5 and the E1-like enzyme, Atg7, are rate-limiting components of Atg8-PE conjugation in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of ATG5 or ATG7 stimulates Atg8 lipidation, autophagosome formation, and autophagic flux. It also induces transcriptional changes opposite to those observed in atg5 and atg7 mutants, favoring stress resistance and growth. As a result, ATG5- or ATG7-overexpressing plants exhibit increased resistance to necrotrophic pathogens and oxidative stress, delayed aging and enhanced growth, seed set, and seed oil content. This work provides an experimental paradigm and mechanistic insight into genetic stimulation of autophagy in planta and shows its efficiency for improving plant productivity.","Autophagy is a major catabolic process whereby autophagosomes deliver cytoplasmic content to the lytic compartment for recycling.

10.1128/mbio.02909-18,<i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> Glucuronoxylomannan and Sterylglucoside Are Required for Host Protection in an Animal Vaccination Model.,"<i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> is an encapsulated fungal pathogen that causes meningoencephalitis. There are no prophylactic tools for cryptococcosis. Previously, our group showed that a <i>C. neoformans</i> mutant lacking the gene encoding sterylglucosidase (Δ<i>sgl1</i>) induced protection in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised murine models of cryptococcosis. Since sterylglucosidase catalyzes degradation of sterylglucosides (SGs), accumulation of this glycolipid could be responsible for protective immunity. In this study, we analyzed whether the activity of SGs is sufficient for the protective effect induced by the Δ<i>sgl1</i> strain. We observed that the accumulation of SGs impacted several properties of the main polysaccharide that composes the fungal capsule, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM). We therefore used genetic manipulation to delete the <i>SGL1</i> gene in the acapsular mutant Δ<i>cap59</i> to generate a double mutant (strain Δ<i>cap59</i>/Δ<i>sgl1</i>) that was shown to be nonpathogenic and cleared from the lung of mice within 7 days post-intranasal infection. The inflammatory immune response triggered by the Δ<i>cap59</i>/Δ<i>sgl1</i> mutant in the lung differed from the response seen with the other strains. The double mutant did not induce protection in a vaccination model, suggesting that SG-related protection requires the main capsular polysaccharide. Finally, GXM-containing extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched in SGs delayed the acute lethality of <i>Galleria mellonella</i> against <i>C. neoformans</i> infection. These studies highlighted a key role for GXM and SGs in inducing protection against a secondary cryptococcal infection, and, since EVs notoriously contain GXM, these results suggest the potential use of Δ<i>sgl1</i> EVs as a vaccination strategy for cryptococcosis.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The number of deaths from cryptococcal meningitis is around 180,000 per year. The disease is the second leading cause of mortality among individuals with AIDS. Antifungal treatment is costly and associated with adverse effects and resistance, evidencing the urgency of development of both therapeutic and prophylactic tools. Here we demonstrate the key roles of polysaccharide- and glycolipid-containing structures in a vaccination model to prevent cryptococcosis.","<i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> is an encapsulated fungal pathogen that causes meningoencephalitis.

Previous versions of the genome sequence were highly fragmented, causing errors in the prediction of protein-coding genes and preventing the analysis of repetitive sequences and genome architecture.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we re-sequenced the genome using single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology and, in combination with optical map data, this provided a gapless assembly of all twelve chromosomes except for the ribosomal DNA repeat cluster on chromosome 7. The more accurate gene annotation made possible by this new assembly revealed a large repertoire of secondary metabolism (SM) key genes (89) and putative biosynthetic pathways (77 SM gene clusters). The two mini-chromosomes differed from the ten core chromosomes in being repeat- and AT-rich and gene-poor but were significantly enriched with genes encoding putative secreted effector proteins. Transposable elements (TEs) were found to occupy 7% of the genome by length. Certain TE families showed a statistically significant association with effector genes and SM cluster genes and were transcriptionally active at particular stages of fungal development. All 24 subtelomeres were found to contain one of three highly-conserved repeat elements which, by providing sites for homologous recombination, were probably instrumental in four segmental duplications.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The gapless genome of C. higginsianum provides access to repeat-rich regions that were previously poorly assembled, notably the mini-chromosomes and subtelomeres, and allowed prediction of the complete SM gene repertoire. It also provides insights into the potential role of TEs in gene and genome evolution and host adaptation in this asexual pathogen.","<h4>Background</h4>The ascomycete fungus Colletotrichum higginsianum causes anthracnose disease of brassica crops and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.

Due to the lack of effective host resistance, management of this disease requires frequent fungicide applications, which greatly increase the economic and environmental costs to produce banana. Weekly applications in most banana plantations lead to rapid evolution of fungicide-resistant strains within populations causing disease-control failures throughout the world. Given its extremely high economic importance, two strains of P. fijiensis were sequenced and assembled with the aid of a new genetic linkage map. The 74-Mb genome of P. fijiensis is massively expanded by LTR retrotransposons, making it the largest genome within the Dothideomycetes. Melting-curve assays suggest that the genomes of two closely related members of the Sigatoka disease complex, P. eumusae and P. musae, also are expanded. Electrophoretic karyotyping and analyses of molecular markers in P. fijiensis field populations showed chromosome-length polymorphisms and high genetic diversity. Genetic differentiation was also detected using neutral markers, suggesting strong selection with limited gene flow at the studied geographic scale. Frequencies of fungicide resistance in fungicide-treated plantations were much higher than those in untreated wild-type P. fijiensis populations. A homologue of the Cladosporium fulvum Avr4 effector, PfAvr4, was identified in the P. fijiensis genome. Infiltration of the purified PfAVR4 protein into leaves of the resistant banana variety Calcutta 4 resulted in a hypersensitive-like response. This result suggests that Calcutta 4 could carry an unknown resistance gene recognizing PfAVR4. Besides adding to our understanding of the overall Dothideomycete genome structures, the P. fijiensis genome will aid in developing fungicide treatment schedules to combat this pathogen and in improving the efficiency of banana breeding programs.","Black Sigatoka or black leaf streak disease, caused by the Dothideomycete fungus Pseudocercospora fijiensis (previously: Mycosphaerella fijiensis), is the most significant foliar disease of banana worldwide.

In the EU, acacia gum has not been formally evaluated by the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF), and therefore, no ADI has been allocated. However, it was accepted for use in weaning food (SCF, 1991). In 1999, the SCF considered 'that the use of acacia gum/gum arabic in coatings for nutrient preparations containing trace elements is acceptable provided carry-over levels in infant formulae, follow-on formulae or FSMP do not exceed 10 mg/kg'. Acacia gum was evaluated by JECFA in 1982 and 1990 and the specifications were amended in 1998. Based on the lack of adverse effects in the available toxicity studies, an ADI 'not specified' was allocated. Following the conceptual framework for the risk assessment of certain food additives re-evaluated under Commission Regulation (EU) No 257/2010, the Panel considered that adequate exposure and toxicity data were available. Acacia gum is unlikely to be absorbed intact and is slightly fermented by intestinal microbiota. No adverse effects were reported in subchronic and carcinogenicity studies at the highest dose tested and there is no concern with respect to the genotoxicity. Oral daily intake of a large amount of acacia gum up to 30,000 mg acacia gum/person per day (approximately equivalent 430 mg acacia gum/kg bw per day) for up to 18 days was well tolerated in adults but some individuals experienced flatulence which was considered by the Panel as undesirable but not adverse effect. The Panel concluded that there is no need for a numerical ADI for acacia gum (E 414), and there is no safety concern for the general population at the refined exposure assessment of acacia gum (E 414) as a food additive.","The Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) provides a scientific opinion re-evaluating the safety of acacia gum (E 414) as a food additive.

Little is known concerning the trade-offs in grasses when perturbing the function of the first gene family in the pathway, PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA LYASE (PAL). Therefore, PAL isoforms in the model grass Brachypodium distachyon were targeted, by RNA interference (RNAi), and large reductions (up to 85%) in stem tissue transcript abundance for two of the eight putative BdPAL genes were identified. The cell walls of stems of BdPAL-knockdown plants had reductions of 43% in lignin and 57% in cell wall-bound ferulate, and a nearly 2-fold increase in the amounts of polysaccharide-derived carbohydrates released by thermochemical and hydrolytic enzymic partial digestion. PAL-knockdown plants exhibited delayed development and reduced root growth, along with increased susceptibilities to the fungal pathogens Fusarium culmorum and Magnaporthe oryzae. Surprisingly, these plants generally had wild-type (WT) resistances to caterpillar herbivory, drought, and ultraviolet light. RNA sequencing analyses revealed that the expression of genes associated with stress responses including ethylene biosynthesis and signalling were significantly altered in PAL knocked-down plants under non-challenging conditions. These data reveal that, although an attenuation of the phenylpropanoid pathway increases carbohydrate availability for biofuel, it can adversely affect plant growth and disease resistance to fungal pathogens. The data identify notable differences between the stress responses of these monocot pal mutants versus Arabidopsis (a dicot) pal mutants and provide insights into the challenges that may arise when deploying phenylpropanoid pathway-altered bioenergy crops.","The phenylpropanoid pathway in plants synthesizes a variety of structural and defence compounds, and is an important target in efforts to reduce cell wall lignin for improved biomass conversion to biofuels.

,Oral Presentations,"<h4>Introduction:</h4> As robotic-guidance and minimally invasive approaches become more prevalent in spine surgery, there is a growing interest in high-level scientific evidence of their clinical value. MIS ReFRESH is the first prospective, comparative, multi-center study designed to assess differences in surgical complication and revision rates, and exposure to intra-operative radiation, in adult degenerative conditions, operated in a minimally invasive (MIS) approach in 1-to-3 level fusions. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> Multicenter data (9 sites) were prospectively collected from 379 adult patients indicated for fusion surgery, including demographics, complications, need for revision surgery and use of intra-operative fluoroscopy (in seconds). A single site randomized patients between arms, while other sites enrolled exclusively to one arm. We compared of incidence of revision surgeries and clinical complications (surgical and medical) through a logistic regression model (Cox) as well as intra-operative fluoroscopy use. <h4>Results:</h4> Altogether, 9 sites enrolled 379 cases: 287 in the robot-guided arm (RG), and 92 in the fluoro-guided arm (FG). One site randomized patients, 15 to RG and 11 to FG. Mean age of RG patients was 59.1 years vs. 62.4 for FG (p = 0.032) and BMI was 31.4 vs. 28.0, respectively (p < 0.001). Sex distribution was similar at 62.0% females in RG and 57.4% in FG (p = 0.468). Charlson Comorbidity Index was 0.5 ± 0.8 in RG vs. 0.3 ± 0.6 in FG (p = 0.022). There were 4.8 ± 1.2 pedicle screws per case in RG vs. 4.3 ± 0.9 screws in FG (p < 0.001). In RG 33% of cases were 2-levels and 5% 3-levels, while in FG 16% were 2-level fusions, and 1% were 3-level fusions. Use of fluoroscopy for the instrumentation phase was 3.8 ± 3.9 seconds/screw in RG vs. 16.9 ± 9.2 in FG (p < 0.001). Average follow up was 174 days in RG and 159 in FG. Within the first year of follow up there were 28 (9.7%) complications in RG vs. 35 (38.0%) in FG, and 4 (1.4%) revisions in RG vs. 4 (4.3%) in FG. When evaluated in a Cox logistic regression model that includes age, gender, BMI, Charlson Comorbidity Index and number of executed screws, the Relative Risk (RR) for a complication was 5.3 times higher in FG compared to RG (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 3.0-9.5, p < 0.001). RR for a revision surgery were 7.1 times higher for a fluoro-guided surgery compared to the robot-guided cases (95% CI 1.6-32.6, p = 0.012). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> We report our findings from a prospective, multi-center, comparative study of MIS lumbar fusions performed with robotic-guidance in 287 patients vs. fluoro-guidance in 92 controls. RR for a complication or a revision surgery was significantly higher in FG during the first year of follow-up compared to RG (5.3-fold and 7.1-fold, respectively). RG reduced fluoroscopy exposure time per case by 78%, or almost a minute, helping offset the patients’ exposure during the pre-operative CT scan required for planning the robotic procedure. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells (hiPS-NSCs) represent an exciting therapeutic strategy for traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) as they can replace lost neural circuits, remyelinate denuded axons and provide local neurotrophic support. Unfortunately, over 95% of affected individuals are in the chronic phase of their injuries where dense deposits of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) in the glial/CSPG scar impair neurite outgrowth and regenerative cell migration. Several scar-modifying enzymes have been shown to synergistically enhance NSC-mediated recovery, however, nonspecific intrathecal administration can produce off-target effects. We aimed to generate a genetically-engineered line of hiPS-NSCs, termed Spinal Microenvironment Modifying and Regenerative Therapeutic (SMaRT) cells, which are uniquely capable of expressing a scar-modifying enzyme within their local environment to enhance functional recovery. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A proprietary CSPG-degrading enzyme was genetically integrated into hiPS-NSCs using non-viral transposon technology. An constitutive EF1α promoter was placed upstream of the enzyme linked by a 2A cleavage peptide to a nuclear import tagged red fluorescent protein (RFP) reporter. A monoclonal line of resultant SMaRT human cells was generated by single-cell fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and expanded. Enzyme expression and enzyme activity was extensively characterized in vitro by biochemical assays and antibody-based slot blots with a chondroitin sulfate (CS) or human CSPG substrate. Ex vivo injured rodent cervical cord sections were also incubated with conditioned media from wild-type hiPS-NSCs and SMaRT cells, followed by immunolabelling to assess in situ CSPG degradation. To assess in vivo efficacy, T-cell deficient RNU rats (N = 60) with translationally-relevant chronic C6-7 clip-contusion injuries were randomized to receive: (1) injury + vehicle, (2) injury + conventional hiPS-NSCs, (3) injury + SMaRT cells, or (4) sham surgery (laminectomy alone). Weekly neurobehavioural assessments of all animals include BBB open-field locomotor scoring, inclined plane test, forelimb grip strength and tail flick sensory test. CatWalk digital gait assessment is also being completed every 4 weeks. <h4>Results:</h4> The monoclonal SmaRT cell line uniformly expresses the RFP reporter and demonstrates key retained hiPS-NSC characteristics such as repeated neurosphere formation, a 46XY karyogram, nestin cytoplasmic staining and the capacity to differentiate along all three neuroglial lineages (neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes). The enzyme expressed by SMaRT cells rapidly degrades CSPGs on WST-1 and DMMB biochemical assays and allows neurons to extend into scar mimicking CSPG-rich regions in vitro. Furthermore, unlike wild-type hiPS-NSC media, conditioned SMaRT cell media can degrade rodent CSPGs in ex vivo injured cord cryosections as assessed by CS-56 (intact long-chain CSPG) immunohistochemistry. While blinded in vivo sensorimotor behavioural assessments are ongoing with a long-term 40-week endpoint, interim histological analyses shows that grafted human cells are extending remarkably long (≥ 20 000 µm) axons along host white matter tracts in both the rostral and caudal directions. These processes extend from the cervicomedullary junction to below the mid-thoracic cord. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> This work provides exciting proof-of-concept data that genetically-engineered SMaRT cells can degrade CSPGs in vitro and that human NSC transplants can grow long axons in chronic cervical SCI to potentially form a bridge for sensorimotor signal transmission. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Incidental dural tears (IDTs) occur in 3-16% of open spine surgeries spinal surgery and 1.7-4.3% of percutaneous endoscopic spine surgeries 1-3). Preventive strategies are important and essential during the endoscopic procedure, since conversion to open surgery for repair must necessitate a wider dissection and laminectomy and, consequently, persistent back pain may occur. Analyzing association of IDTs with specific operative maneuvers during biportal endoscopic spine surgery (BESS) would help surgeons to formulate strategies for decreasing their incidence. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> We retrospectively reviewed all BESSs performed for degenerative lumbar spine diseases, including lumbar disc herniation (LDH), recurrent LDH, spinal stenosis with/without degenerative spondylolisthesis, and spondylolytic spondylolisthesis, from December. 2014 to December. 2016. Retrospective review of the causes of IDTs and the associated operative maneuvers during BESS by three surgeons were analyzed to modify the pattern of the procedures and the operative plan to prevent un-hopeful IDTs. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging examination was performed at postoperative 2 or 3 days, 1 week, and 1 month postoperatively to determinate the success of the treatment. <h4>Results:</h4> There were 16 cases (1.2%) of IDTs in a total of 1351 operations. Of these, 10 (62.5%) occurred within the first 6-months during the learning curve. The IDT locations included 7 cases at central and 9 cases at lateral side to the dura. The Small-sized tears (≤ 10 mm) occurred in 13 cases; (11 slit tears and 2 flap tears) while, the Large-sized tears ( > 10 mm) occurred in 3 cases; (2 slit tears and 1 flap tear). Specific maneuvers associated with IDTs included punching under blurred vision (6 cases, 37.5%), curetting for adhesiolysis (4), direct injury to the central folding of the dura (2), burring over the dura after flavectomy (1), imprecise handling of the muscle dilator (1), laminectomized sharp bone-edges (1), and blind procedures under the ligamentum flavum (1). The initial treatments included mechanical packing with Gelfoam (7), Fibrin glue (6), immediate open repair (2), and blood patching for unnoticed IDT (1). The Success rate of the compression technique without direct suturing for small-sized IDTs less than 10 mm was 92.3% (12/13). Conversion to open repair was needed in 3 cases of large tears and one 1 case of small tear after failure of blood patching. There were no progression instances to wound infection or pyogenic spondylitis. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Maintaining a clear surgical field during BESS is very important to prevent IDTs while securing saline outflow and maintaining thorough control of small bleeds. Small IDTs (≤10 mm) may be treated successfully with the compression technique even without direct suturing. Large-sized IDTs and large flap tears were recommended to open repair. Practiced handling of the surgical instruments safely and a thorough understanding of the surgical anatomy under a saline-filled surgical field may reduce the risk of IDTs during BESS, especially during the initial learning curve. <h4>Introduction:</h4> The intervertebral disc is integral to the stability, flexibility and function of the spine. However, despite technological advances the common understanding of the anatomy of the intervertebral disc is that of a bi-layered structure consisting of the annulus fibrosus (AF) and nucleus pulposus (NP). Some groups have demonstrated a histological tri-layered structure with division of the AF into outer annular (OA) and inner annular (IA) segments. We performed a qualitative laboratory based animal study using 9.4 T MRI, light microscopy histology, immunohistochemistry and polarised microscopy revealing new insights into the microarchitecture of the intervertebral disc. We demonstrated five distinct regions with each layer possessing unique anatomical properties that underpin its physiological and biomechanical function in health and disease. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> 30 lumbar intervertebral discs from 6 mature ewes involved in a cellular regenerative study were acquired at necropsy. Lumbar discs L2/3, L3/4 and L4/5 in all ewes had been exposed to a validated injury model consisting of a 6 x 20 mm incision into the AF via an anterolateral retroperitoneal approach, whilst discs L1/2 and L5/6 served as uninjured controls. Disc degeneration had been allowed to progress naturally up to 3 months. 9.4 T MRI was applied to all discs followed by careful preparation for microanatomical analysis. 5 micron thick slides were acquired consisting of vertebral body-disc-vertebral body using a standard rotatory microtome and prepared for histological analyses, immunohistochemistry and polarised microscopy. <h4>Results:</h4> The 9.4 T MRI provided high resolution images of the intervertebral disc demonstrating exceptional anatomical detail that surpassed any previously demonstrated by radiological techniques. Radiological confirmation of sinuvertebral nerve and perforating artery penetration of the degenerate intervertebral discs was confirmed radiologically for the first time providing new insights into the physiological processes that take place during disc degeneration. Furthermore, we were able to radiologically demonstrate a collagenous structure to the NP. Early changes in the transitional zone (TZ) of control discs provides insight into possible early degenerative changes in this region in adjacent level degenerative disc disease. The 9.4 T MRI findings were complemented by histology and polarised birefringence microscopy demonstrating 5 discrete microanatomical regions of the intervertebral discs consisting of the OA, IA, TZ, and peripheral and central NP (pNP and cNP respectively). The lamellation of the TZ could be clearly distinguished from the IA and OA. The pNP consists of a proteoglycan rich matrix with distinct concentric collagenous sheets forming a lattice of linearly arranged chondrocytes and admixed notochordal cells. This structure is completely lost in the cNP, a region focally exposed to multidimensional forces. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> 9.4 T MRI in conjunction with modern histological techniques and polarised microscopy provide novel insights into the architecture of the intervertebral disc, defining 5 distinct regions that underpin it’s biomechanical and physiological properties. <h4>Introductions:</h4> Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) are common in the elderly. Traditional bilateral PKP approaches were regarded as safe and effective. Nevertheless, unilateral PKP approaches were accepted attribute to surgical time, safety, and less expense. We performed the meta-analysis to compare the unilateral and bilateral PKP for patients with OVCF in terms of the short- and long-term clinical outcomes and complications. <h4>Methods:</h4> Randomized or non-randomized controlled trials published up to Jul. 2017 that compared the unilateral and bilateral PKP for the treatment of OVCF were included by a comprehensive search in the Cochrane, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CNKI. The main measure outcomes included: the short- and long-term postoperative Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores, the short-term postoperative Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), operation time, restoration rate, cement dosage and leakage, and postoperative adjacent-level fractures. <h4>Results:</h4> A total of 17 studies involving 1344 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The mean operative time and cement dosage were less in the unilateral groups compared with the bilateral groups (p < 0.05). Unilateral PKP had a better degree of pain relief (visual analog scale) than bilateral PKP (p = 0.05) with short-term follow-up (within 4 weeks) after operation. However, Bilateral PKP approach has high restoration rate (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the long-term postoperative VAS scores between them (P = 0.13), the short-term postoperative ODI (P = 0.75), risk ratio of cement leakage (p = 0.07) and postoperative adjacent-level fractures (p = 0.97) between the two groups. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> In conclusion, our meta-analysis showed unilateral PKP was associated with shorter operative time, lower VAS in the short-term and less dosage of PMMA than bilateral PKP. However, Bilateral PKP approach has high restoration rate. There was no significative difference in the long-term clinical outcomes and complications between them. More high-quality randomized controlled trails should be required to make sure which method is better for the treatment of OVCF in the future. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a common cause of lower back pain. Calcification of the intervertebral disc (IVD) has been correlated with DDD, and is especially prevalent in scoliotic discs. The appearance of calcium deposits has been shown to increase with age, and its occurrence has been associated with several other disorders such as hyperparathyroidism, chondrocalcinosis, and arthritis. Trauma, vertebral fusion and infection have also been shown to increase the incidence of IVD calcification. Calcification is the product of free calcium (Ca2+) and phosphate (PO4). Our preliminary data suggest that ionic calcium and P04 content are increased from [2.0 – 8.0 mM] and [1.0 – 4.0 mM], for mild, moderate and severe degenerative IVDs, respectively. The roles of these individual ions on IVD function and in the development DDD is unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Ca2+, PO4, and their combination on IVD nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosis (AF) cells. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Bovine IVD cells were isolated from bovine caudal tails of 20-24-month-old steers. Cells were recovered from NP and AF tissue by sequential digestion with Pronase followed by Collagenase, and expanded in low glucose DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Cells were expanded in flasks then prepared for 3D culturing in alginate beads at a density of 1*106 cells/mL. Beads were cultured in medium containing increasing Ca2+ [1.0, 3.0, 6.0 mM], PO4 [1.0, 2.0, 4.0 mM], or their combination and cultured for 12 days. A modified GAG assay was performed on the beads to determine proteoglycan content and Western blotting for type II collagen (Col II) synthesis. Cell viability was determined by counting live and dead cells in the beads following incubation with the Live/Dead Viability Assay kit. Cell numbers in beads at the end of the incubation period was determined using Quant-iT dsDNA Assay Kit. Bovine IVD organ culture model was performed as previously described. IVDs were cultured for 4 weeks in Ca2+ [1.0 and 6.0 mM] with and without PO4 [4.0 mM]. <h4>Results:</h4> Using similar Ca2+ concentrations found in degenerate [1.8 – 6.0 mM], Ca2+ dose-dependently decreased matrix protein synthesis of proteoglycan and Col II in NP and AF cells (n = 4). Moreover, increasing PO4, from 1 – 4 mM, further decreases in matrix protein synthesis was observed (n = 4). Interestingly, although cell viability was unaltered from higher PO4 or Ca2+ concentrations, the combination of PO4 and Ca2+ significantly affected cell proliferation (n = 3). IVDs cultured in increasing Ca2+ demonstrated decreased total proteoglycan content in both NP and AF regions. Western blotting for aggrecan in NP and AF tissues showed similar results. Histology and immunohistochemistry was performed to identify proteoglycan and nerve growth factor expression, respectively. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Our results suggest that changes in the local concentrations of calcium and PO4 are not benign, and that the combination of these ions affects IVD cell growth and matrix protein synthesis. Ca2+ and PO4 may be a contributing factor in IVD degeneration and pain. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Hemivertebra (HV) resection with short segmental fusion for congenital scoliosis is a standard procedure for young children with localized deformity. However, such a technique might not best address the deformities with long-spanned kyphotic scoliosis secondary to HV. In these cases, a hybrid growing rod technique with hemivertebrectomy and short fusion may be the option. Therefore, the current study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes and complications of this hybrid technique. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> Thirteen patients who were treated with this hybrid technique were reviewed. There were 5 patients with single rod and 8 with dual rods after apical hemivertebra resection and short fusion. They had averagely 2.2 lengthening procedures with an average follow-up of 34.7 months. The magnitude of coronal/sagittal deformity and T1-S1 height were measured on the preoperative, postoperative, and last follow-up radiographs. The complications were recorded. <h4>Results:</h4> The average coronal Cobb angle of main curve was 74.8 degrees before the index surgery, 24.3 degrees after the index surgery, and 25.6 degrees at the last follow-up. The correction rate was 65.8%. The mean global kyphosis was corrected from 64.2 degrees to 34.3 degrees postoperatively and further improved to 28.3 degrees at the latest follow-up. The average height of T1-S1 was 238.4 mm before the index surgery, 270.5 mm after the index surgery, and 282 mm at the latest follow-up. The average growth rate was 12.8 mm per year. One case had rod breakage 8 months after the index surgery and was revised during the planned lengthening. One case exprenced superficial wound infection in 3 weeks after the index surgery and were successfully with debridement. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The hybrid growing rod technique with hemivertebrectomy and short fusion is safe and effective in the treatment of congenital kyphotic scoliosis with a long curve. The technique is an alternative for young children with multiple anomalous vertebrae and a long curve to avoid early long fusion. <h4>Introduction:</h4> The goals of surgical correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) are to achieve a balance spine with a parallel fusion block. Preoperative curve flexibility assessment is integral in the radiographic evaluation and surgical decision making. The aim of this prospective study was to compare five radiographic techniques in flexibility assessment and correlate them to surgical correction. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A prospective comparative observational study was carried out in two academic institutions in Hong Kong and Turkey. Consecutive patients undergoing AIS surgical collections were recruited between June 2016 to August 2017. Preoperative radiographic evaluation included standing posteroanterior and lateral whole spine, supine, supine side bending, fulcrum bending (FB) in both sites; awake traction in Hong Kong; and supine traction under general anaesthesia (STUGA) in Turkey. Surgical correction and fusion levels were determined by the surgeons’ usual technique, and postoperative radiographs were taken. For each radiographic assessment, correction rate and flexibility percentages were calculated, and correction index was the correction rate as a percentage of the flexibility. Statistical differences were calculated. <h4>Results:</h4> 76 patients were recruited into the study, but 2 patients had anterior surgery and were excluded from analysis. 74 patients (65 females and 9 males) with an average age of 13.91 years (range, 11-18) at the time of operation. 51 patients had a thoracic major curve (34 cases Lenke 1; 10 Lenke 2; and 7 Lenke 3), and 23 patients had a thoracolumbar or lumbar major curve (21 cases Lenke 5 and 2 Lenke 6). For thoracic curves, mean preoperative standing frontal Cobb was 57.8o (range, 34.3o-79.7o), and the mean postoperative Cobb was 15.5o (range, 1-40.7o) with a mean correction rate of 72.5% (range, 27.1%-97.9%). For lumbar curves mean preoperative Cobb was 50.3o (range, 35o-88o), and the mean postoperative Cobb was 8.0o (range, 0.1o-22o) with a mean correction rate of 84.5% (range, 59.1%-99.8%). The correction indices showed that the most predictive dynamic assessment for AIS correction was FB, compared with STUGA (p = 0.2), awake traction (p = 0.004), supine side bending (p = 0.003), and supine (p = 0.000) for thoracic curves. For lumbar curves, FB, STUGA and supine side bending were similar in prediction (p > 0.05), which were better than supine film (p = 0.000). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Although correction rate can give an indication of the amount of correction achieved per case, it is inaccurate to compare between different cases as it does not take into account the intrinsic flexibility of the curve, and does not necessarily reflect on either the surgical technique or the instrumentation strategy. Correction index takes into account of the curve’s intrinsic flexibility, and the closer one gets to 100%, the more effective is the final surgical correction in taking up this flexibility. Our study showed that FB is most predictive in thoracic curves undergoing posterior instrumented fusion. In lumbar curves which are usually more flexible, no statistical significant difference was found amongst different dynamic radiographs in predicting surgical correction. An accurate flexibility assessment will allow improve pre-operative planning for the need of additional release and fusion level determination. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Surgical site infections (SSI) represent a major complication of spinal surgery, with the patient's physiological skin flora being the main reservoir. The local microbioma of the back is highly specific and differs significantly from other areas of the human body. As the predominant bacteria strains are not covered by the European Standard Specifications for antiseptic evaluation, little is known regarding the specific efficacy of routinely used antiseptics for spinal surgery procedures. Aim of the presented study is to evaluate the efficacy of different antiseptic solutions in a spinal surgery specific in vitro and in vivo setting. <h4>Materials & Methods:</h4> The bacterial spectrum causing SSI after spinal surgery in our department was analysed retrospectively for 2015. Representative bacterial cultures were harvested from wound swabs and cultivated in Lysogeny Broth. PVP-Iodine (Braunol®), Hexetidin (Isozid®), Propanol/Biphenyol (Kodan forte®) and Octenidin (Octenisept®) were evaluated. Bacterial proliferation was monitored by measuring medium turbidity at 600 nm prior to disinfection, immediately and after 1 and 3 hours to simulate the time course of a surgical procedure. Colony forming units were evaluated on agar plates. Additionally, swabs were taken in the OR from skin incision and the surgical blade after routine disinfection with Propanol/Biphenyol (n = 138) and after changing pre-operative skin preparation to Octenidin (n = 638) as a result of in vitro evaluation. <h4>Results:</h4> Bacterial spectrum: Staph. epidermidis was responsible for 37% of the SSIs, followed by Propionibacterium acnes (17%), Enterococcus faecalis (14%), and Proteus mirabilis respectively Staph. aureus accounting for 6% each. Staph. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and Stap aureus could be cultivated from wound swabs and used for the subsequent evaluation. In vitroevaluation: The efficacy of the antiseptic solutions tested varied significantly: Octenidin demonstrated a significantly higher efficacy (p < 0,01) in vitro and was able to completely eradicate or test bacteria except for Proteus mirabilis, which was still reduced to 1% of the initial bacterial load. In contrast, 9% (Propanol/Biphenyol) resp. 2% (PVP-iodine), resp. 10% (Hexetidin) of the initial Staph epidermidis were still present after disinfection. Hexetidin showed the lowest remanent effect with Staph. epidermidis increasing to 21% of the initial bacterial load after 3 hours. In vivoevaluation: Following skin preparation with propanol/Biphenyol in the OR, 31% of the swabs taken resulted in positive bacterial testing. According to our in vitro results, pre-operative disinfection routine was changed to Octenidin (Octeniderm®, as Octenisept® is not licensed for surgical skin preparation). Subsequently, the number of positive swabs was reduced to 22% (p < 0,021). Most of the positive swabs derived from the surgical blade and contained Staph. epidermidis or P. acnes. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Antisepsis does not automatically mean a total eradication of the local microbiome. Even under standardized in vitro conditions, a significant bacterial load could be detected after disinfection. The antiseptic solutions evaluated differed significantly regarding their efficacy. Octenidin demonstrated a significantly higher effectiveness on a spinal surgery specific microbioma in vitro and in vivo. While the test strains were reduced beyond the level of detection during in vitro evaluation, deeper layers of the skin, which are not reached by antiseptic treatment, may act as reservoir in vivo. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Sacral Slanting in congenital scoliosis has never been reported despite of its high incidence. Great challenge remains in restoring coronal balance after hemivertebra resection with short fusion in cases with Sacral Slanting. The purpose of this study was to clarify its definition, etiology and surgical strategy. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> From July 2004 to December 2014, clinical charts and radiographic data of patients with early-onset congenital scoliosis were reviewed. Posterior hemivertebra resection with short fusion was performed in all cases that met our critieria. Coronal and sagittal parameters, as well as Sacral slanted angle and UIV-Pelvis Angle, were measured. Sacral Slanting was defined as the angle of more than 5° and severe Sacral Slanting was thought to be more than 10°. Statistical analyses were performed. <h4>Results:</h4> 42 consecutive patients were included. The mean age was 4.0 years old with an average follow-up of 51.7 months. The mean segmental curve was 34.9° before surgery, 4.7° immediately postoperatively, and 8.7° at final follow-up. Trunk shift was 15.4 mm preoperatively, 16.9 mm immediately after surgery and 12.1 mm at final follow-up. Sacral slanted angle was measured as 7.2° before surgery. Sacral Slanting could be noticed in 26 patients with an incidence of 61.9%. Patients with hemivertebrae at or below L3 had higher incidence of Sacral Slanting than that with hemivertebrae above L3. Severe Sacral Slanting was noted in 11 patients with an incidence of 26.2%. Sacral slanted angle was corrected to 5.1° immediately after surgery. And at final follow-up, it was 4.5°. Postoperative UIV-Pelvis Angle was 3.9°. Postoperative UIVT was correlated positively with postoperative TS. Two independent risk factors were identified for postoperative proximal adding-on: larger postoperative Sacral Slanted Angle and larger postoperative UIV-Pelvis Angle. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Sacral Slanting was rarely recognized despite its high incidence. The etiology may be congenital malformation and sacrum rotation. Segmental undercorrection and placing a more central and even UIV were wise strategies for congenital EOS with severe Sacral Slanting. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Pedicle screws have been used for posterior spinal fixation since the free hand technique was first reported in 1959. Multiple methods have since been developed to facilitate more accurate screw placement, such as stereotactic-guiding and intraoperative fluoroscopy, though they also increase radiation exposure and operative interval. Pedicle screws remain technically demanding to place. Aberrant screws can lead to serious neurovascular complications, including radicular pain, sensory loss, damage to great vessels, and damage to the pleural cavity. We propose that a predominant factor of pedicle screw breach is due to the inherent vertebral anatomy involved at a given spinal level. While it has been suggested that vertebrae morphology can influence breach incidence, there has never been a clear link made between isthmus size and the rate of pedicle screw breach. The study aims to investigate the inverse correlation between breach incidence and vertebral isthmus width. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> We retrospectively reviewed the post-operative computed tomography (CT) scans of 91 patients who underwent thoracolumbar (T2-L5) surgery at the Jewish General Hospital. Average patient age was 62.9 years and the patients were 58% male and 42% female. Radiologically detectable breach incidence was computed and a Fisher exact test was performed. Each breach was also categorized as minor ( < 2 mm) or major ( > 2 mm). Clinical correlation was not a requirement for presence of breach. Isthmus width is defined as the narrowest portion of the pedicle in the mediolateral plan. The average isthmus width by spinal level, reported by Zindrick in 1986, was then compared to the collected breach incidences by spinal level. A regression analysis and Pearson’s correlation was performed. <h4>Results:</h4> A total of 656 pedicle screws were analyzed and 233 radiologically detectable breaches were found, though only 8 patients developed post-operative symptoms clinically relevant to the detected breach. The average incidence of breach was 35.5%, while the average incidence of major breach was 8.6%. Breach incidence was over two times higher in the thoracic than the lumbar spine while major breach incidence was three times higher (Fisher exact test, P < .0001). A lateral breach was three times less likely to occur than a medial breach, though it was twice as likely to be a major breach (Fisher exact test, P < .0001). The two spinal levels with the thinnest average isthmus width - T4 and T5 - had the highest breach incidence, whereas the two spinal levels with the thickest average isthmus width – L4 and L5 – had the lowest breach incidence. Breach incidence and isthmus width were shown to have a significant inverse correlation with an R squared of 0.7 (Pearson’s correlation, P < .0001). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> A thinner vertebral isthmus width significantly increases the pedicle screw breach incidence. The smaller size and complex pedicle morphology of the thoracic spine was breached over two times more frequently than the larger pedicles of the lumbar spine, which allow for more degrees of freedom. Despite the high incidence of cortical bone violation observed, there was little correlation with clinical symptoms and we were unable to conclude the absolute size of breach necessary for symptoms to develop. A breach is not automatically a clinical problem, provided the screw remains structurally sound and the patient symptomless. One must consider every case uniquely. Image-guided assistance may be most useful where breach incidence is highest and isthmus width is lowest, particularly between T3 and T6. <h4>Introduction:</h4> The thoracic spine is considered as a semi-rigid region in human spine. Several studies have reported dynamic changes of the thoracic spine in terms of motion and cross-sectional area of the thoracic spinal cord. The movement of thoracic spinal cord within dural sac and the change in mid-sagittal diameter in correlation with positional changed is still unknown. The aims of this study were (1) to evaluate the dynamic change of anterior and posterior Space Available for Cord (SAC) of the thoracic spinal cord in the dural sac in three position, neutral, flexion, and extension, and (2) to evaluate the dynamic change of the thoracic spinal cord in mid-sagittal diameter in three positions. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> 118 patients (66 males and 52 females, mean age of 45.6 ± 10.6) who underwent thoracic spine kMRI were evaluated from T4/5 to T11/12 in flexion, neutral, and extension positions. The anterior SAC, posterior SAC, and mid-sagittal thoracic cord diameter were measure at the level of each intervertebral disc from T4-5 to T11-12. The anterior SAC is the distance from posterior borders of the disc to the anterior border of the thoracic cord. The posterior SAC is the distance from the posterior border of the thoracic cord to the anterior border of the posterior column at each level. The mid-sagittal cord diameter is the distance between anterior and posterior border of thoracic cord, and was measured in the mid-sagittal plane of the MRI. The Friedman’s test was used to test the statistical significance for each parameter in three positions, then Wilcoxon-signed-rank test was used for post-hoc analysis. P-value of less than 0.0167 was considered statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. <h4>Results:</h4> Between three positions, there were statistically significant differences in anterior SAC at levels T8-9 to T11-12 (p < 0.001 at T9-10 to T11-12, p = 0.001 at T8-9). The posterior SAC also showed statistically significant difference between three positions at T4-5, T7-8, T8-9 and T9-10 level. For mid-sagittal cord diameter, there were statistically significant differences between three positions at T4-5, T6-7, T8-9, T9-10, and T10-11 (p < 0.01). After post-hoc analysis, the anterior SAC in flexion position was significantly narrower than in the neutral and in the extension position at T8-9 to T11-12 level. The T8-9 level had significantly wider posterior SAC in flexion than in the neutral position. Thoracic spinal cord mid-sagittal diameter significantly increased in flexion position when compared to the neutral position at T8-9, T9-10, and T11-12 level. On the other hand, thoracic cord at T4-5 in extension position was significantly narrower than in the neutral position. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Thoracic spinal cord changed in shape and position in the dural sac during positional changes. In flexion position, the thoracic cord at T8-9 and below tended to move anteriorly closer to posterior vertebral body and intervertebral disc. The thoracic cord, itself, increased in mid-sagittal diameter in flexion position at the levels below T8-9. In flexion position there is a higher chance of spinal cord compression if there are lesion in the anterior epidural space, especially at the levels below T8-9. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Long segment fusion is often utilized in the treatment of symptomatic spinal deformity. Proximal junction kyphosis (PJK) (Kyphotic Cobb angle > 15 degrees) can lead to proximal junctional failure, and has revision surgery rates reported up to 27% within 6 months following primary surgery. As cited in our previous study, the use of a tapered dose of prophylactic bone in UIV (T10), UIV+1 (T9) and UIV+2 (T8) in an instrumented T10-S1 model, which eliminated fractures at T7 (supra adjacent to the augmented T8 vertebra). The tapered dose of bone cement and the disc spaces may buffer axial forces, allowing for a smoother load transfer through the segments. The optimal dose and configuration of the tapered dose of bone cement has also been cited in our previous study. In this current parametric study, we explore the effects of the bone cement placed near the upper and lower end plates and distributed vertically or horizontally in the adjacent proximal vertebrae. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A validated FE model from T6-pelvis was used for the analyses. An osteoporotic model was developed and modified by insertion of pedicle screws and rods from T10 to S1, therein simulating the standard surgical procedure in-silico. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement was injected in the UIV (T10), UIV+1 (T9) and UIV+2 (T8). 2.5 cc of cement was injected in T10, 2 cc in T9 and 1 cc in T8 near the upper endplate, lower endplate, distributed in a vertical direction and a horizontal direction in the vertebrae. The load was applied to a metal bock 10 mm anterior to the center of the vertebra to simulate flexion moment and the pelvis was fixed. The stresses at the end plates from T7 to T10 were analyzed. <h4>Results:</h4> Except for 3.8% increase at the T7 inferior endplate for the bone cement placed near the upper endplates, lower stresses were observed when the cement was placed near the upper endplates as compared to placement near the lower endplates, ranging from 3% to 20.5% at the T9 superior endplate. Lower stresses were observed at all endplates for horizontal cement distribution as compared to vertical cement distribution. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Our data suggests bone cement should be injected close to the upper endplates and not the lower endplates, to decrease endplate stresses and thus the risk of vertebral fractures. Additionally, as compared to vertically distributed cement, bone cement should be spread horizontally to reduce endplate stresses and thus reducing the risk of compression fractures. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Surgical decompression and stabilization followed by radiosurgery represents an effective method for local tumor control and neurologic preservation for patients with metastatic epidural spinal cord compression. We have previously demonstrated improvement in HrQOL after this combined modality treatment (“hybrid therapy”). The current analysis focuses on delineation of patient-specific prognostic factors predictive of HrQOL change after combined surgery-SRS treatment of MESCC. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> This is a prospective, single-center, cohort study. One hundred and eleven patients with MESCC who underwent separation surgery followed by SRS were included. Prognostic factors associated with improved patient reported outcome (PRO) measures. PRO tools, i.e. Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and MD Anderson Symptom Inventory – Spine Tumor (MDASI-SP), both validated in the cancer population, were prospectively collected. Numeric prognostic factors were correlated with PRO measures using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Categorical prognostic factors were correlated with PRO measures using the Wilcoxon two-sample test (for two categories) or the Kruskal-Wallis test (for three or more categories). All statistical tests were two-sided with a level of significance < 0.05 for correlation of prognostic factors with PRO constructs and a level of significance < 0.0014 for correlation of prognostic factors with PRO items. Statistical analyses were done in SAS (version 9.4, Cary, NC). <h4>Results:</h4> One hundred and eleven patients were included in this analysis. Patients with lower pre-operative Medical Research Council (MRC) motor scores experienced a greater decrease in symptom interference (BPI Interference construct (p = 0.03), and individual functional measures including general activity (p = 0.001), walking (p = 0.001) and normal work (p = 0.006)). Lumbar location was associated with better outcomes than cervical or thoracic as noted on the BPI pain experience construct (p = 0.03) and MDASI-SP interference (p = 0.01) and core symptom (p = 0.002) constructs. Patients with ASIA scores of C or D benefit more than those with ASIA E on BPI Interference construct (p = 0.04)). Patients with higher ECOG scores at presentation benefit more than those with low ECOG scores on MDASI-SP interference construct, (p = 0.03)). Women benefit more than men on BPI interference (p = 0.03) and pain experience (p = 0.04) constructs. Patients with prior spinal surgery at the current level of interest benefit less than those which are naïve surgical patients in MDASI-SP interference construct, (p = 0.04). <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Delineation of patient characteristics associated with HrQOL improvement provides crucial information for patient selection, patient education and setting treatment expectations. For patients with MESCC treated with hybrid therapy using surgery and radiosurgery, the presence of neurological deficits and diminished performance status, lumbar tumor level and female gender were associated with greater PRO improvement. <h4>Introduction:</h4> This meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety in cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for treating cervical degenerative disc diseases (CDDDs). <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> The authors searched RCTs in the electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, Embase, Springer Link, Web of Knowledge, OVID and Google Scholar) from their establishment to march 2016 without language restrictions. We also manually searched the reference lists of articles and reviews for possible relevant studies. Researches on CDA versus ACDF in CDDDs were selected in this meta-analysis. The quality of all studies was assessed and effective data was pooled for this meta-analysis. Outcome measurements were surgical parameters (operative time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay), clinical indexes (neck disability index (NDI), neurological success, range of motion (ROM), Visual Analogue Score (VAS)), complications (the number of adverse events, adjacent segment disease (ASD), and reoperation). Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias assessment were also performed, respectively. The meta-analysis was performed with software RevMan 5.3. <h4>Results:</h4> 37 articles (20 RCTs) with a total 4123 patients (1762 in the CDA and 1472 in the ACDF) met inclusion criteria. Eight types of disc prostheses were used in the included studies. Patients were followed up for at least two years in all the studies. No statistically significant differences were found between CDA and ACDF for blood loss (SMD -0.02; 95% CI (−0.20, 0.17)), length of hospital stay (MD -0.06; 95% CI (−0.19, 0.06)). Statistical differences were found between operative time (MD 14.22; 95% CI (6.73, 21.71)), NDI (SMD −0.27; 95% CI (−0.43, −0.10)), neurological success (RR 1.13; 95%CI (1.08, 1.18)), ROM (MD 6.72; 95%CI (5.72, 7.71)), VAS of neck (SMD -0.40; 95%CI (−0.75, −0.04)), VAS of arm (SMD −0.55; 95%CI (-1.04, -0.06)), the rate of adverse events (RR 0.72 95% CI (0.53, 0.96)), the rate of ASD (RR 0.62; 95% CI (0.43, 0.88)), and reoperation (RR 0.50; 95% CI (0.39, 0.63)). Subgroup analysis stratified by different types of disc prostheses was also performed. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> CDA is associated with higher clinical indexes and fewer complications than ACDF, indicating that it is a safe and effective treatment for CDDDs. However, the operative time of CDA is longer than ACDF and NDI score of CDA is lower than ACDF. Because of some limitations, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Additional studies are needed. Large, definitive RCTs are needed. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Despite retrospective studies that have shown that longer packed red blood cell (PRBC) storage duration worsens patient outcomes, randomized clinical trials have found no difference in outcomes. However, no studies have examined the impact of giving the oldest blood (28 days-old or more) on morbidity within spine surgery. Our objective in this study was to describe the association between storage duration of PRBCs and perioperative adverse events in patients undergoing spine surgery at a tertiary care center. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> The surgical administrative database at our institution was queried for patients transfused with PRBCs who underwent spine surgery between December 4, 2008 and June 26, 2015. Patients undergoing spinal fusion, tumor-related surgeries, and other identified spine surgeries were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on storage duration of blood transfused: exclusively ≤ 28 days’ storage or exclusively > 28 days’ storage. The primary outcome was composite in-hospital morbidity, which included: (1) infection, (2) thrombotic event, (3) renal injury, (4) respiratory event, and/or (5) ischemic event. <h4>Results:</h4> In total, 1,141 patients who received a transfusion were included for analysis in this retrospective study; 710 were transfused exclusively with PRBCs ≤ 28 days’ storage and 431 exclusively with PRBCs > 28 days’ storage. Perioperative complications occurred in 119 patients (10.4%). Patients who received blood stored for > 28 days had higher odds of developing any one complication (odds ratio [OR] = 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-2.74; P = 0.005) even after adjusting for competing perioperative risk factors. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Blood stored for > 28 days is independently associated with higher odds of developing perioperative complications in patients transfused during spinal surgery. Our results suggest that blood storage duration may be an appropriate parameter to consider when developing institutional transfusion guidelines that seek to optimize patient outcomes. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Currently the UK national screening committee does not recommend screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). In two tertiary spinal centres serving two different but large geographical areas, we investigated first presentation of AIS and the potential impact that introducing a school prevention programme (SPP) may have. In light of evidence for bracing as well as new technology for the growing spine including vertebral body tethering there is a real need to re-explore school screening. <h4>Methods:</h4> Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital and St. George’s Hospital performed a retrospective case review of all new children referred over a 2-year period (2015-16) was performed, noting age at presentation, aetiology, curve magnitude, Risser grade, and intention to treat on first consultation. Four groups of patients were identified: early onset idiopathic ( < 10 years), syndromic (any age), adolescent patients with a potential to treat with a brace according to the SRS bracing criteria, or adolescents too skeletally mature or with curves beyond bracing criteria. <h4>Results:</h4> Of 488 cases, 286 were diagnosed with scoliosis (Cobb > 10°), 66% (n = 189) female. 26 with early onset scoliosis, mean Cobb angle of 37.7° and 37 patients in the syndromic group, mean Cobb of 44° respectively. We identified that of 57 patients with AIS and Risser grade 0-2 of which 11.1% (n = 32) were within bracing range, and 8.7% (n = 25) were beyond bracing magnitude. 58% (n = 166) with Risser grade 3-5. 30% (n = 87) curves too large to brace. <h4>Discussion:</h4> Fusion of the spine for scoliosis is an invasive treatment carrying significant morbidity. Only 11.1% of first presentation AIS fulfilled the SRS criteria for bracing. Following publication of level I evidence demonstrating that bracing is effective at altering the natural history of AIS and the results of this study give a good snapshot of current incidence, strongly supporting the need to introduce a school prevention programme in the U.K. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Early onset scoliosis (EOS) was first described in 1936 and since then, the concept had been evolving. Nowadays, EOS is used to depict a deviation of more than 10° in the frontal plain measured by Cobb’s method. Previous treatment options included premature spine fixation, leading to cardiopulmonary complications and short torso syndrome. The advent of new treatment choices has resulted in diminishing of those ancient complications and better quality of life for children. Two of the most popular systems are growing rods and Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Rib (VEPTR); however these new systems has its own complications such as infections, skin and neurological damage and high rate of surgical interventions. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> An observational cross sectional study comparing patients with EOS diagnosis, who underwent surgical correction using growing rods or VEPTR systems between 2010 and 2016 in an IV level Orthopedics children Institute were evaluated. A non-probabilistic sampling was performed. Statistical analysis was performed with STATA v14 Statistics program. <h4>Results:</h4> 54 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age at intervention were 6.6 and 6 years old for rods and VEPTR groups respectively. Mean Cobb angle was 62.9 for rods group and 66.4 for VEPTR. Gender distribution was as follows 7:3 and 6.5:4.5 for Rods and VEPTR. The groups were matched for every variable. Regarding the correction of the spine deformity, both systems achieved a statically significant value (Growing Rods p < 0.00 001 VEPTR p < 0.01; however, when compared with each other, growing rods achieved the best correction with statistical significance p < 0.04. Mean time between consecutive elongation surgeries was 11 months. No difference was noted between primary outcomes, including complications and only important difference were found in secondary variables without the possibility of establishing the individual value. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> EOS is challenging for spine surgeon due to the complexity of patients and additional comorbidities. Nowadays elongations systems are the mainstay of treatment. Growing rods and VEPTR systems are the most widespread worldwide. Growing Rods appears to better correct deformity without increase in complications, making it a more efficient system. Current literature recommends surgery every 9-12 months in contrast with previous concept of every 6 months, obtaining same clinical outcome with lower complications rates. <h4>Introduction:</h4> There is preclinical data indicating that early decompression in spinal cord injury (SCI) can improve outcome. Fehlings et al has shown in the STASCIS study the there is an advantage in decompression under 24 hours in cervical spine fractures. Our objective was to evaluate the relative effectiveness of surgery done under 12 hours from traumatic SCI. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A retrospective review of all patients admitted to a level one trauma center with SCI between 01/2006 to 02/2017, we included patients who were surgically treated within 48 hours of admission with 6 month or more follow up. Patients’ medical records were reviewed for location of vertebra fracture, presence of acute spinal cord injury, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, time to surgery (group A: less than 12 hours, group B: 12-24 hours, group C: 24-48 hours), length of hospital stay, ASIA impairment scale before surgery, after surgery, and at long term follow up. The neurological outcome was compared to the results present in the STASCIS study. <h4>Results:</h4> 49 patients (35 males: 14 females) with SCI were admitted and surgically treated within 48 hours of admission. Mean age at admission was 36 years (range 15-79 years). The mean follow up was 30 months (range 7-110 months). 50% were injured in motor vehicle accident while 48% due to falls. 37 were operated within 12 hours (average- 5.5 hours (range 1.5-11), 7 were operated between 12-24 hours and 5 were operated after 24 hours. At long term follow up after surgery, 55% of patients with acute spinal cord injury had been improved in their ASIA scale. After Surgery, in group A 67.5% of patients improved in their ASIA score (P = 0.06 when compared to under 24 hours in the STASCIS study) with 41% with a 2 grade or more improvement in their ASIA scores (P < 0.01 when compared to under 24 hours in the STASCIS study), in group B 44% of patients improved in their ASIA, while in group C only 40% of patients improved in their ASIA score (none of them had ≥ 2 grade improvement in their ASIA scores). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Early surgical intervention should be advised for patients with acute spinal cord injury. Surgery under 12 hours from the trauma should be recommended at as it is associated with improved outcome. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Surgery is increasingly recommended as the preferred treatment strategy for patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), as it can halt neurologic deterioration and significantly improve functional impairment, disability and quality of life. Despite objective post-operative clinical improvements, experience dictates that a proportion of patients remain dissatisfied with their outcome. Discrepancies between clinical measures and self-reported ratings of health status after surgery, often referred to as response shift, can be due changes in patients’ internal standards of measurement, values and/or conceptualization of quality of life. This study aims to investigate the presence of response shift in functional outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for DCM. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Four hundred and seventy-nine DCM patients were prospectively enrolled in the AOSpine-CSM-International study at 16 global sites. Functional impairment, disability and quality of life were evaluated at baseline and 1-year following surgery. Patients were also asked to complete the SF-36 questionnaire and to rate their general health status compared to one year ago (much better, somewhat better, the same, somewhat worse, much worse). Descriptive analyses were conducted to evaluate the concordance between achieving a clinically important improvement (MCID) in function (modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) scale) and self-reported ratings of health status. Concordance was defined as achieving a MCID and reporting general health as somewhat better or much better, whereas discordance was defined as achieving a MCID and reporting general health as the same, somewhat worse or much worse. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine important differences between patients with discrepancies between their clinical measures and self-reported ratings and those without. <h4>Results:</h4> Four-hundred-one patients had complete follow-up data at 1-year and were included in this analysis. Based on patient self-reports, 55 patients were somewhat or much worse than a year ago, 82 patients were the same and 264 patients were somewhat or much better. Thirty-one percent of patients who reported being somewhat or much worse achieved a MCID on the mJOA. In addition, 56% of patients who indicated their health status was the same as one year ago exhibited clinically meaningful improvements in functional impairment. Univariate analyses indicated that there is an increased likelihood of observing a discrepancy between functional outcomes and self-reported ratings if the patient (1) exhibited less improvement in mJOA upper extremity scores (p = 0.071), (2) was older (p = 0.0073), (3) was a smoker (p = 0.082) and (4) achieved lower total mJOA scores at 1-year (p = 0.087). Following multivariate analysis, the most important factors were age and improvement in mJOA upper extremity scores. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> A response shift in functional outcomes was detected in patients undergoing surgery for DCM. Older patients, as well as those with smaller improvements in postoperative upper extremity scores, tend to report worsened or unchanged general health status, in spite of experiencing clinically significant improvement in overall post-operative function. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Presently, spine professionals use a static image to assist in surgical planning and patient education. However, the spine is not a static object. While the soft tissue anatomy of the spine is well elucidated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the flexible, dynamic nature of the spine is difficult to visualize and portray, especially to patients. Therefore, the goal of this study was to implement spine kinematics and common degenerative pathologies in an interactive virtual reality (VR) program and determine its efficacy in improving patient education and communication. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> We developed a library of digital 3D models of spinal anatomy that can be visualized and manipulated within a virtual environment. A generic healthy model of the spine was created using the Autodesk Maya® modeling software. Kinematics parameters were informed using published literature [1]. Clinical cases depicting degenerative pathology were likewise modeled after patient examples. These models were animated and exported to a Unity Game Engine application, which was run on a Samsung Gear VR headset. IRB approval was obtained and patients seen at the UCLA Spine Center were provided with the headset during their consultation. A survey was administered at the conclusion of the visit to quantify patient satisfaction and gauge the patients’ understanding of the relevant discussed anatomy. <h4>Results:</h4> Spine professionals can easily guide and educate patients regarding spinal anatomy and degenerative pathologies in an immersive VR environment. The scenario’s that present foraminal stenosis and central canal stenosis due to disk bulging and ligament hypertrophy were reported to be most useful by patients. Likewise, the kinematic model of the spine allowing visualization of lumbar flexion and extension enabled physician to better explain these dynamic states of the spine to the patients. No adverse events were observed and preliminary data from surveys demonstrates high patient satisfaction with the educational content and experience. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Unlike static 2D medical images, VR allows people to immerse themselves in an educational environment that is difficult to create in real life, such as the inside of a spinal canal. The visualizations included color-coded anatomy, animations, and interactive movement based on real patient information. Patients not only improved their understanding of the pathology, but the technology enabled patients to feel more confident overall about their diagnosis. Future work will determine if this understanding and confidence will translate to improved patient consent prior to surgical interventions, preparation for post-operation safety needs, and reduced readmissions [2, 3, 4]. Furthermore, our aim is to ultimately present patients with 3D VR models that are personalized with their pathology, which can then be used for surgical planning also by surgeons. References 1.

While surgical intervention is often recommended1, obtaining an MRI prior to going to the operating room is at the discretion of the treating surgeon. MRI has been shown to be useful in determining the extent of soft-tissue damage in spinal trauma, but each study did not distinguish whether or not a spinal cord injury was present.2-4 <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A survey of 127 spine surgeons was conducted to determine whether or not operative treatment plans were directly changed by the availability of MRI imaging studies in patients who had thoracolumbar burst fractures (T10-L1) and incomplete spinal cord injuries. The patients for this study (n = 10) were identified by searching the Department of Radiology’s diagnosis database for the diagnosis of burst fracture and both CT and MRI studies that were obtained prior to any surgical interventions. The admission history and physical exam for each of these patients was also reviewed to determine whether or not an incomplete spinal cord injury was present at the time of initial evaluation. The axial and sagittal CT studies as well as the initial history and physical for each of these 10 patients were deidentified and presented to the surgeons participating in the survey. Each participant was then asked to formulate a surgical plan. Once a surgical plan was formulated based on the CT scan, they were asked whether or not an MRI was desired and why. The axial and sagittal T2 MRI scan images were then presented. The surgeons were then asked whether or not this altered their initial surgical plan. <h4>Results:</h4> Of those surveyed, 66% were practicing as Orthopaedic and 34% as Neurosurgery trained spine surgeons. The majority (66%) of those responding to the survey have been in practice greater than 10-years. In the patient population presented, after reviewing the initial CT scan, 41% of respondents stated that they would like to obtain an MRI before proceeding to the operating room. This was desired to evaluate for discoligamentous injuries adjacent to the fractured segment, to determine if anterior only treatment is sufficient or due to suspicion of adjacent bony injury not evident on CT scan. After reviewing the MRI, 19% of all respondents stated that their previous surgical plan had been changed. Out of the 41% of respondents that desired a MRI scan after evaluating the CT scan, 45% stated that they had changed their surgical plan. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The majority of the time (59%), respondents did not feel that an MRI was necessary for operative planning. Eighty-one percent of the time, MRI made no difference in planned treatment. The MRI was most often desired due to it being the standard protocol of the treating institution or to evaluate the posterior ligamentous complex. In conclusion, the operative treatment of patients with thoraco-lumbar burst fractures is changed in 1 out of 5 patients by imaging the injured levels with an MRI. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Spinal segment arthrodesis has become a widely accepted treatment for degenerative disorders of the lumbar spine. However spinal fusion alters the normal biomechanics of the spine and eliminates mobile segments causing overload of adjacent segments. In recent years, increasing importance in degenerative decompensation of the adjacent segment after lumbar fusion is attached to spino-pelvic malalignment. At the same time, according to some authors, the overload of the adjacent segment in conditions of a PI-LL parameter mismatch exceeding 11° leads to the ASD development. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> This prospective study evaluated 86 patients who were treated from 2011 to 2013 for lumbar canal stenosis with TLIF. All patients had preop PI-LL mismatch greater than 11° with no other global balance disturbance (SVA < 4 cm, PT < 20°). All patients had one level fusion with pedicle screws and TLIF with interbody PEEK cage. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the operative technique. First group consisted of 42 patients with minimal invasive bilateral facet joint resection, pedicle screw fixation and TLIF. Second group included 44 patients with operational technique aimed at the lumbar lordosis increasing. These patients were treated with Smith-Peterson osteotomy and TLIF with the most anterior cage position. The average follow-up was 44 months (36-62 months). <h4>Results:</h4> There were no statistically significant differences in operative time, blood loss and postop pain level between two groups. Comparison of the pre- and postoperative values within the groups showed significant differences in the second group for lumbar lordosis (p = 0.037). Summary in the I group symptomatic ASD was found in 14 cases (33.3%) during all follow-up period with 85.7% frequently of revision surgery. In the II group symptomatic ASD was identified in 2 patients (4.5%), one of them needed revision surgery. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The described technique of operative treatment allows to achieve an increase in lumbar lordosis up to 10 degrees on one segment without increasing surgery trauma. This technique has shown a statistically significant (p = 0.012) prevention of ASD development in patients with PI-LL mismatch. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency can lead to a form of myelopathy known as subacute combined degeneration (SCD), which is characterized by damage to the dorsal and lateral columns of the spinal cord. Nitrous oxide is an inhaled anesthetic which irreversibly oxidizes the cobalt ion of vitamin B12, interfering with its function as a key coenzyme. Although a number of individual case reports have described the development of SCD following nitrous oxide anesthesia, it is unknown what factors predispose patients to SCD or are predictive of long-term recovery. In this study, we conduct a systematic literature review of reported cases of SCD following nitrous oxide anesthesia. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> A medical librarian performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases after consultation with the lead authors and a Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) analysis of key articles provided by the research team. The final searches retrieved a total of 339 references, which were pooled in EndNote and de-duplicated to 148. 4 further studies were identified by examining the reference lists of all included articles. Two separate screeners (KP and AN) evaluated the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the eligible articles in a standardized manner. The following data were extracted from each eligible article: patient characteristics, the duration of nitrous oxide anesthesia, neurological findings, laboratory values, imaging factors, treatment, and recovery. Mann-Whitney U tests, Independent T-tests, and Chi Square tests were performed, with significance considered at p < 0.05 and trends considered at p < 0.15. <h4>Results:</h4> Our systematic search identified 152 unique articles. After screening these articles by title, abstract, and full-text, a total of 32 studies, reporting a total of 39 cases of nitrous oxide-induced SCD, were deemed relevant. These cases included 22 male patients and 17 female patients, with an average age of 51.3 years (SD 17.6). An etiology for subclinical deficiency, including pernicious anemia, atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, ileal resection, Crohn’s Disease, and nutritional deficiency, was determined in 31 reports, while there was no evidence of pre-operative deficiency in 8 reports. Duration of nitrous oxide exposure was described in 19 reports, and ranged from 30 minutes to 11 hours. Univariate analysis failed to find any association between post-operative recovery and age (p = 0.41), sex (p = 0.48), positive MRI findings (p = 0.42), and post-operative serum B12 (p = 0.96). However, there was a tendency of post-operative high Hemoglobin (p = 0.09) and post-operative high Mean Corpuscular Volume (p = 0.14) to relate with worse neurological recovery. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Given the high prevalence of subclinical B12 deficiency and the potential for relatively short exposures to nitrous oxide to precipitate SCD, it is imperative that surgeons remain aware of this process. In patients with postsurgical myelopathy, the physician should evaluate serum B12 and consider the possibility that nitrous oxide could cause a subclinical B12 deficiency to become overt. Further, we recommend screening patients undergoing surgery for risk factors or signs of B12 deficiency to avoid post-operative myelopathy. Since we were limited by a small cohort in this study, the trends identified here will be important to study further with larger patient populations.","<h4>Introduction:</h4> As robotic-guidance and minimally invasive approaches become more prevalent in spine surgery, there is a growing interest in high-level scientific evidence of their clinical value. MIS ReFRESH is the first prospective, comparative, multi-center study designed to assess differences in surgical complication and revision rates, and exposure to intra-operative radiation, in adult degenerative conditions, operated in a minimally invasive (MIS) approach in 1-to-3 level fusions. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> Multicenter data (9 sites) were prospectively collected from 379 adult patients indicated for fusion surgery, including demographics, complications, need for revision surgery and use of intra-operative fluoroscopy (in seconds). A single site randomized patients between arms, while other sites enrolled exclusively to one arm. We compared of incidence of revision surgeries and clinical complications (surgical and medical) through a logistic regression model (Cox) as well as intra-operative fluoroscopy use. <h4>Results:</h4> Altogether, 9 sites enrolled 379 cases: 287 in the robot-guided arm (RG), and 92 in the fluoro-guided arm (FG). One site randomized patients, 15 to RG and 11 to FG. Mean age of RG patients was 59.1 years vs. 62.4 for FG (p = 0.032) and BMI was 31.4 vs. 28.0, respectively (p < 0.001). Sex distribution was similar at 62.0% females in RG and 57.4% in FG (p = 0.468). Charlson Comorbidity Index was 0.5 ± 0.8 in RG vs. 0.3 ± 0.6 in FG (p = 0.022). There were 4.8 ± 1.2 pedicle screws per case in RG vs. 4.3 ± 0.9 screws in FG (p < 0.001). In RG 33% of cases were 2-levels and 5% 3-levels, while in FG 16% were 2-level fusions, and 1% were 3-level fusions. Use of fluoroscopy for the instrumentation phase was 3.8 ± 3.9 seconds/screw in RG vs. 16.9 ± 9.2 in FG (p < 0.001). Average follow up was 174 days in RG and 159 in FG. Within the first year of follow up there were 28 (9.7%) complications in RG vs. 35 (38.0%) in FG, and 4 (1.4%) revisions in RG vs. 4 (4.3%) in FG. When evaluated in a Cox logistic regression model that includes age, gender, BMI, Charlson Comorbidity Index and number of executed screws, the Relative Risk (RR) for a complication was 5.3 times higher in FG compared to RG (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 3.0-9.5, p < 0.001). RR for a revision surgery were 7.1 times higher for a fluoro-guided surgery compared to the robot-guided cases (95% CI 1.6-32.6, p = 0.012). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> We report our findings from a prospective, multi-center, comparative study of MIS lumbar fusions performed with robotic-guidance in 287 patients vs. fluoro-guidance in 92 controls. RR for a complication or a revision surgery was significantly higher in FG during the first year of follow-up compared to RG (5.3-fold and 7.1-fold, respectively). RG reduced fluoroscopy exposure time per case by 78%, or almost a minute, helping offset the patients’ exposure during the pre-operative CT scan required for planning the robotic procedure. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells (hiPS-NSCs) represent an exciting therapeutic strategy for traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) as they can replace lost neural circuits, remyelinate denuded axons and provide local neurotrophic support. Unfortunately, over 95% of affected individuals are in the chronic phase of their injuries where dense deposits of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) in the glial/CSPG scar impair neurite outgrowth and regenerative cell migration. Several scar-modifying enzymes have been shown to synergistically enhance NSC-mediated recovery, however, nonspecific intrathecal administration can produce off-target effects. We aimed to generate a genetically-engineered line of hiPS-NSCs, termed Spinal Microenvironment Modifying and Regenerative Therapeutic (SMaRT) cells, which are uniquely capable of expressing a scar-modifying enzyme within their local environment to enhance functional recovery. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A proprietary CSPG-degrading enzyme was genetically integrated into hiPS-NSCs using non-viral transposon technology. An constitutive EF1α promoter was placed upstream of the enzyme linked by a 2A cleavage peptide to a nuclear import tagged red fluorescent protein (RFP) reporter. A monoclonal line of resultant SMaRT human cells was generated by single-cell fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and expanded. Enzyme expression and enzyme activity was extensively characterized in vitro by biochemical assays and antibody-based slot blots with a chondroitin sulfate (CS) or human CSPG substrate. Ex vivo injured rodent cervical cord sections were also incubated with conditioned media from wild-type hiPS-NSCs and SMaRT cells, followed by immunolabelling to assess in situ CSPG degradation. To assess in vivo efficacy, T-cell deficient RNU rats (N = 60) with translationally-relevant chronic C6-7 clip-contusion injuries were randomized to receive: (1) injury + vehicle, (2) injury + conventional hiPS-NSCs, (3) injury + SMaRT cells, or (4) sham surgery (laminectomy alone). Weekly neurobehavioural assessments of all animals include BBB open-field locomotor scoring, inclined plane test, forelimb grip strength and tail flick sensory test. CatWalk digital gait assessment is also being completed every 4 weeks. <h4>Results:</h4> The monoclonal SmaRT cell line uniformly expresses the RFP reporter and demonstrates key retained hiPS-NSC characteristics such as repeated neurosphere formation, a 46XY karyogram, nestin cytoplasmic staining and the capacity to differentiate along all three neuroglial lineages (neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes). The enzyme expressed by SMaRT cells rapidly degrades CSPGs on WST-1 and DMMB biochemical assays and allows neurons to extend into scar mimicking CSPG-rich regions in vitro. Furthermore, unlike wild-type hiPS-NSC media, conditioned SMaRT cell media can degrade rodent CSPGs in ex vivo injured cord cryosections as assessed by CS-56 (intact long-chain CSPG) immunohistochemistry. While blinded in vivo sensorimotor behavioural assessments are ongoing with a long-term 40-week endpoint, interim histological analyses shows that grafted human cells are extending remarkably long (≥ 20 000 µm) axons along host white matter tracts in both the rostral and caudal directions. These processes extend from the cervicomedullary junction to below the mid-thoracic cord. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> This work provides exciting proof-of-concept data that genetically-engineered SMaRT cells can degrade CSPGs in vitro and that human NSC transplants can grow long axons in chronic cervical SCI to potentially form a bridge for sensorimotor signal transmission. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Incidental dural tears (IDTs) occur in 3-16% of open spine surgeries spinal surgery and 1.7-4.3% of percutaneous endoscopic spine surgeries 1-3). Preventive strategies are important and essential during the endoscopic procedure, since conversion to open surgery for repair must necessitate a wider dissection and laminectomy and, consequently, persistent back pain may occur. Analyzing association of IDTs with specific operative maneuvers during biportal endoscopic spine surgery (BESS) would help surgeons to formulate strategies for decreasing their incidence. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> We retrospectively reviewed all BESSs performed for degenerative lumbar spine diseases, including lumbar disc herniation (LDH), recurrent LDH, spinal stenosis with/without degenerative spondylolisthesis, and spondylolytic spondylolisthesis, from December. 2014 to December. 2016. Retrospective review of the causes of IDTs and the associated operative maneuvers during BESS by three surgeons were analyzed to modify the pattern of the procedures and the operative plan to prevent un-hopeful IDTs. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging examination was performed at postoperative 2 or 3 days, 1 week, and 1 month postoperatively to determinate the success of the treatment. <h4>Results:</h4> There were 16 cases (1.2%) of IDTs in a total of 1351 operations. Of these, 10 (62.5%) occurred within the first 6-months during the learning curve. The IDT locations included 7 cases at central and 9 cases at lateral side to the dura. The Small-sized tears (≤ 10 mm) occurred in 13 cases; (11 slit tears and 2 flap tears) while, the Large-sized tears ( > 10 mm) occurred in 3 cases; (2 slit tears and 1 flap tear). Specific maneuvers associated with IDTs included punching under blurred vision (6 cases, 37.5%), curetting for adhesiolysis (4), direct injury to the central folding of the dura (2), burring over the dura after flavectomy (1), imprecise handling of the muscle dilator (1), laminectomized sharp bone-edges (1), and blind procedures under the ligamentum flavum (1). The initial treatments included mechanical packing with Gelfoam (7), Fibrin glue (6), immediate open repair (2), and blood patching for unnoticed IDT (1). The Success rate of the compression technique without direct suturing for small-sized IDTs less than 10 mm was 92.3% (12/13). Conversion to open repair was needed in 3 cases of large tears and one 1 case of small tear after failure of blood patching. There were no progression instances to wound infection or pyogenic spondylitis. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Maintaining a clear surgical field during BESS is very important to prevent IDTs while securing saline outflow and maintaining thorough control of small bleeds. Small IDTs (≤10 mm) may be treated successfully with the compression technique even without direct suturing. Large-sized IDTs and large flap tears were recommended to open repair. Practiced handling of the surgical instruments safely and a thorough understanding of the surgical anatomy under a saline-filled surgical field may reduce the risk of IDTs during BESS, especially during the initial learning curve. <h4>Introduction:</h4> The intervertebral disc is integral to the stability, flexibility and function of the spine. However, despite technological advances the common understanding of the anatomy of the intervertebral disc is that of a bi-layered structure consisting of the annulus fibrosus (AF) and nucleus pulposus (NP). Some groups have demonstrated a histological tri-layered structure with division of the AF into outer annular (OA) and inner annular (IA) segments. We performed a qualitative laboratory based animal study using 9.4 T MRI, light microscopy histology, immunohistochemistry and polarised microscopy revealing new insights into the microarchitecture of the intervertebral disc. We demonstrated five distinct regions with each layer possessing unique anatomical properties that underpin its physiological and biomechanical function in health and disease. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> 30 lumbar intervertebral discs from 6 mature ewes involved in a cellular regenerative study were acquired at necropsy. Lumbar discs L2/3, L3/4 and L4/5 in all ewes had been exposed to a validated injury model consisting of a 6 x 20 mm incision into the AF via an anterolateral retroperitoneal approach, whilst discs L1/2 and L5/6 served as uninjured controls. Disc degeneration had been allowed to progress naturally up to 3 months. 9.4 T MRI was applied to all discs followed by careful preparation for microanatomical analysis. 5 micron thick slides were acquired consisting of vertebral body-disc-vertebral body using a standard rotatory microtome and prepared for histological analyses, immunohistochemistry and polarised microscopy. <h4>Results:</h4> The 9.4 T MRI provided high resolution images of the intervertebral disc demonstrating exceptional anatomical detail that surpassed any previously demonstrated by radiological techniques. Radiological confirmation of sinuvertebral nerve and perforating artery penetration of the degenerate intervertebral discs was confirmed radiologically for the first time providing new insights into the physiological processes that take place during disc degeneration. Furthermore, we were able to radiologically demonstrate a collagenous structure to the NP. Early changes in the transitional zone (TZ) of control discs provides insight into possible early degenerative changes in this region in adjacent level degenerative disc disease. The 9.4 T MRI findings were complemented by histology and polarised birefringence microscopy demonstrating 5 discrete microanatomical regions of the intervertebral discs consisting of the OA, IA, TZ, and peripheral and central NP (pNP and cNP respectively). The lamellation of the TZ could be clearly distinguished from the IA and OA. The pNP consists of a proteoglycan rich matrix with distinct concentric collagenous sheets forming a lattice of linearly arranged chondrocytes and admixed notochordal cells. This structure is completely lost in the cNP, a region focally exposed to multidimensional forces. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> 9.4 T MRI in conjunction with modern histological techniques and polarised microscopy provide novel insights into the architecture of the intervertebral disc, defining 5 distinct regions that underpin it’s biomechanical and physiological properties. <h4>Introductions:</h4> Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) are common in the elderly. Traditional bilateral PKP approaches were regarded as safe and effective. Nevertheless, unilateral PKP approaches were accepted attribute to surgical time, safety, and less expense. We performed the meta-analysis to compare the unilateral and bilateral PKP for patients with OVCF in terms of the short- and long-term clinical outcomes and complications. <h4>Methods:</h4> Randomized or non-randomized controlled trials published up to Jul. 2017 that compared the unilateral and bilateral PKP for the treatment of OVCF were included by a comprehensive search in the Cochrane, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CNKI. The main measure outcomes included: the short- and long-term postoperative Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores, the short-term postoperative Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), operation time, restoration rate, cement dosage and leakage, and postoperative adjacent-level fractures. <h4>Results:</h4> A total of 17 studies involving 1344 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The mean operative time and cement dosage were less in the unilateral groups compared with the bilateral groups (p < 0.05). Unilateral PKP had a better degree of pain relief (visual analog scale) than bilateral PKP (p = 0.05) with short-term follow-up (within 4 weeks) after operation. However, Bilateral PKP approach has high restoration rate (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the long-term postoperative VAS scores between them (P = 0.13), the short-term postoperative ODI (P = 0.75), risk ratio of cement leakage (p = 0.07) and postoperative adjacent-level fractures (p = 0.97) between the two groups. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> In conclusion, our meta-analysis showed unilateral PKP was associated with shorter operative time, lower VAS in the short-term and less dosage of PMMA than bilateral PKP. However, Bilateral PKP approach has high restoration rate. There was no significative difference in the long-term clinical outcomes and complications between them. More high-quality randomized controlled trails should be required to make sure which method is better for the treatment of OVCF in the future. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a common cause of lower back pain. Calcification of the intervertebral disc (IVD) has been correlated with DDD, and is especially prevalent in scoliotic discs. The appearance of calcium deposits has been shown to increase with age, and its occurrence has been associated with several other disorders such as hyperparathyroidism, chondrocalcinosis, and arthritis. Trauma, vertebral fusion and infection have also been shown to increase the incidence of IVD calcification. Calcification is the product of free calcium (Ca2+) and phosphate (PO4). Our preliminary data suggest that ionic calcium and P04 content are increased from [2.0 – 8.0 mM] and [1.0 – 4.0 mM], for mild, moderate and severe degenerative IVDs, respectively. The roles of these individual ions on IVD function and in the development DDD is unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Ca2+, PO4, and their combination on IVD nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosis (AF) cells. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Bovine IVD cells were isolated from bovine caudal tails of 20-24-month-old steers. Cells were recovered from NP and AF tissue by sequential digestion with Pronase followed by Collagenase, and expanded in low glucose DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Cells were expanded in flasks then prepared for 3D culturing in alginate beads at a density of 1*106 cells/mL. Beads were cultured in medium containing increasing Ca2+ [1.0, 3.0, 6.0 mM], PO4 [1.0, 2.0, 4.0 mM], or their combination and cultured for 12 days. A modified GAG assay was performed on the beads to determine proteoglycan content and Western blotting for type II collagen (Col II) synthesis. Cell viability was determined by counting live and dead cells in the beads following incubation with the Live/Dead Viability Assay kit. Cell numbers in beads at the end of the incubation period was determined using Quant-iT dsDNA Assay Kit. Bovine IVD organ culture model was performed as previously described. IVDs were cultured for 4 weeks in Ca2+ [1.0 and 6.0 mM] with and without PO4 [4.0 mM]. <h4>Results:</h4> Using similar Ca2+ concentrations found in degenerate [1.8 – 6.0 mM], Ca2+ dose-dependently decreased matrix protein synthesis of proteoglycan and Col II in NP and AF cells (n = 4). Moreover, increasing PO4, from 1 – 4 mM, further decreases in matrix protein synthesis was observed (n = 4). Interestingly, although cell viability was unaltered from higher PO4 or Ca2+ concentrations, the combination of PO4 and Ca2+ significantly affected cell proliferation (n = 3). IVDs cultured in increasing Ca2+ demonstrated decreased total proteoglycan content in both NP and AF regions. Western blotting for aggrecan in NP and AF tissues showed similar results. Histology and immunohistochemistry was performed to identify proteoglycan and nerve growth factor expression, respectively. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Our results suggest that changes in the local concentrations of calcium and PO4 are not benign, and that the combination of these ions affects IVD cell growth and matrix protein synthesis. Ca2+ and PO4 may be a contributing factor in IVD degeneration and pain. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Hemivertebra (HV) resection with short segmental fusion for congenital scoliosis is a standard procedure for young children with localized deformity. However, such a technique might not best address the deformities with long-spanned kyphotic scoliosis secondary to HV. In these cases, a hybrid growing rod technique with hemivertebrectomy and short fusion may be the option. Therefore, the current study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes and complications of this hybrid technique. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> Thirteen patients who were treated with this hybrid technique were reviewed. There were 5 patients with single rod and 8 with dual rods after apical hemivertebra resection and short fusion. They had averagely 2.2 lengthening procedures with an average follow-up of 34.7 months. The magnitude of coronal/sagittal deformity and T1-S1 height were measured on the preoperative, postoperative, and last follow-up radiographs. The complications were recorded. <h4>Results:</h4> The average coronal Cobb angle of main curve was 74.8 degrees before the index surgery, 24.3 degrees after the index surgery, and 25.6 degrees at the last follow-up. The correction rate was 65.8%. The mean global kyphosis was corrected from 64.2 degrees to 34.3 degrees postoperatively and further improved to 28.3 degrees at the latest follow-up. The average height of T1-S1 was 238.4 mm before the index surgery, 270.5 mm after the index surgery, and 282 mm at the latest follow-up. The average growth rate was 12.8 mm per year. One case had rod breakage 8 months after the index surgery and was revised during the planned lengthening. One case exprenced superficial wound infection in 3 weeks after the index surgery and were successfully with debridement. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The hybrid growing rod technique with hemivertebrectomy and short fusion is safe and effective in the treatment of congenital kyphotic scoliosis with a long curve. The technique is an alternative for young children with multiple anomalous vertebrae and a long curve to avoid early long fusion. <h4>Introduction:</h4> The goals of surgical correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) are to achieve a balance spine with a parallel fusion block. Preoperative curve flexibility assessment is integral in the radiographic evaluation and surgical decision making. The aim of this prospective study was to compare five radiographic techniques in flexibility assessment and correlate them to surgical correction. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A prospective comparative observational study was carried out in two academic institutions in Hong Kong and Turkey. Consecutive patients undergoing AIS surgical collections were recruited between June 2016 to August 2017. Preoperative radiographic evaluation included standing posteroanterior and lateral whole spine, supine, supine side bending, fulcrum bending (FB) in both sites; awake traction in Hong Kong; and supine traction under general anaesthesia (STUGA) in Turkey. Surgical correction and fusion levels were determined by the surgeons’ usual technique, and postoperative radiographs were taken. For each radiographic assessment, correction rate and flexibility percentages were calculated, and correction index was the correction rate as a percentage of the flexibility. Statistical differences were calculated. <h4>Results:</h4> 76 patients were recruited into the study, but 2 patients had anterior surgery and were excluded from analysis. 74 patients (65 females and 9 males) with an average age of 13.91 years (range, 11-18) at the time of operation. 51 patients had a thoracic major curve (34 cases Lenke 1; 10 Lenke 2; and 7 Lenke 3), and 23 patients had a thoracolumbar or lumbar major curve (21 cases Lenke 5 and 2 Lenke 6). For thoracic curves, mean preoperative standing frontal Cobb was 57.8o (range, 34.3o-79.7o), and the mean postoperative Cobb was 15.5o (range, 1-40.7o) with a mean correction rate of 72.5% (range, 27.1%-97.9%). For lumbar curves mean preoperative Cobb was 50.3o (range, 35o-88o), and the mean postoperative Cobb was 8.0o (range, 0.1o-22o) with a mean correction rate of 84.5% (range, 59.1%-99.8%). The correction indices showed that the most predictive dynamic assessment for AIS correction was FB, compared with STUGA (p = 0.2), awake traction (p = 0.004), supine side bending (p = 0.003), and supine (p = 0.000) for thoracic curves. For lumbar curves, FB, STUGA and supine side bending were similar in prediction (p > 0.05), which were better than supine film (p = 0.000). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Although correction rate can give an indication of the amount of correction achieved per case, it is inaccurate to compare between different cases as it does not take into account the intrinsic flexibility of the curve, and does not necessarily reflect on either the surgical technique or the instrumentation strategy. Correction index takes into account of the curve’s intrinsic flexibility, and the closer one gets to 100%, the more effective is the final surgical correction in taking up this flexibility. Our study showed that FB is most predictive in thoracic curves undergoing posterior instrumented fusion. In lumbar curves which are usually more flexible, no statistical significant difference was found amongst different dynamic radiographs in predicting surgical correction. An accurate flexibility assessment will allow improve pre-operative planning for the need of additional release and fusion level determination. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Surgical site infections (SSI) represent a major complication of spinal surgery, with the patient's physiological skin flora being the main reservoir. The local microbioma of the back is highly specific and differs significantly from other areas of the human body. As the predominant bacteria strains are not covered by the European Standard Specifications for antiseptic evaluation, little is known regarding the specific efficacy of routinely used antiseptics for spinal surgery procedures. Aim of the presented study is to evaluate the efficacy of different antiseptic solutions in a spinal surgery specific in vitro and in vivo setting. <h4>Materials & Methods:</h4> The bacterial spectrum causing SSI after spinal surgery in our department was analysed retrospectively for 2015. Representative bacterial cultures were harvested from wound swabs and cultivated in Lysogeny Broth. PVP-Iodine (Braunol®), Hexetidin (Isozid®), Propanol/Biphenyol (Kodan forte®) and Octenidin (Octenisept®) were evaluated. Bacterial proliferation was monitored by measuring medium turbidity at 600 nm prior to disinfection, immediately and after 1 and 3 hours to simulate the time course of a surgical procedure. Colony forming units were evaluated on agar plates. Additionally, swabs were taken in the OR from skin incision and the surgical blade after routine disinfection with Propanol/Biphenyol (n = 138) and after changing pre-operative skin preparation to Octenidin (n = 638) as a result of in vitro evaluation. <h4>Results:</h4> Bacterial spectrum: Staph. epidermidis was responsible for 37% of the SSIs, followed by Propionibacterium acnes (17%), Enterococcus faecalis (14%), and Proteus mirabilis respectively Staph. aureus accounting for 6% each. Staph. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and Stap aureus could be cultivated from wound swabs and used for the subsequent evaluation. In vitroevaluation: The efficacy of the antiseptic solutions tested varied significantly: Octenidin demonstrated a significantly higher efficacy (p < 0,01) in vitro and was able to completely eradicate or test bacteria except for Proteus mirabilis, which was still reduced to 1% of the initial bacterial load. In contrast, 9% (Propanol/Biphenyol) resp. 2% (PVP-iodine), resp. 10% (Hexetidin) of the initial Staph epidermidis were still present after disinfection. Hexetidin showed the lowest remanent effect with Staph. epidermidis increasing to 21% of the initial bacterial load after 3 hours. In vivoevaluation: Following skin preparation with propanol/Biphenyol in the OR, 31% of the swabs taken resulted in positive bacterial testing. According to our in vitro results, pre-operative disinfection routine was changed to Octenidin (Octeniderm®, as Octenisept® is not licensed for surgical skin preparation). Subsequently, the number of positive swabs was reduced to 22% (p < 0,021). Most of the positive swabs derived from the surgical blade and contained Staph. epidermidis or P. acnes. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Antisepsis does not automatically mean a total eradication of the local microbiome. Even under standardized in vitro conditions, a significant bacterial load could be detected after disinfection. The antiseptic solutions evaluated differed significantly regarding their efficacy. Octenidin demonstrated a significantly higher effectiveness on a spinal surgery specific microbioma in vitro and in vivo. While the test strains were reduced beyond the level of detection during in vitro evaluation, deeper layers of the skin, which are not reached by antiseptic treatment, may act as reservoir in vivo. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Sacral Slanting in congenital scoliosis has never been reported despite of its high incidence. Great challenge remains in restoring coronal balance after hemivertebra resection with short fusion in cases with Sacral Slanting. The purpose of this study was to clarify its definition, etiology and surgical strategy. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> From July 2004 to December 2014, clinical charts and radiographic data of patients with early-onset congenital scoliosis were reviewed. Posterior hemivertebra resection with short fusion was performed in all cases that met our critieria. Coronal and sagittal parameters, as well as Sacral slanted angle and UIV-Pelvis Angle, were measured. Sacral Slanting was defined as the angle of more than 5° and severe Sacral Slanting was thought to be more than 10°. Statistical analyses were performed. <h4>Results:</h4> 42 consecutive patients were included. The mean age was 4.0 years old with an average follow-up of 51.7 months. The mean segmental curve was 34.9° before surgery, 4.7° immediately postoperatively, and 8.7° at final follow-up. Trunk shift was 15.4 mm preoperatively, 16.9 mm immediately after surgery and 12.1 mm at final follow-up. Sacral slanted angle was measured as 7.2° before surgery. Sacral Slanting could be noticed in 26 patients with an incidence of 61.9%. Patients with hemivertebrae at or below L3 had higher incidence of Sacral Slanting than that with hemivertebrae above L3. Severe Sacral Slanting was noted in 11 patients with an incidence of 26.2%. Sacral slanted angle was corrected to 5.1° immediately after surgery. And at final follow-up, it was 4.5°. Postoperative UIV-Pelvis Angle was 3.9°. Postoperative UIVT was correlated positively with postoperative TS. Two independent risk factors were identified for postoperative proximal adding-on: larger postoperative Sacral Slanted Angle and larger postoperative UIV-Pelvis Angle. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Sacral Slanting was rarely recognized despite its high incidence. The etiology may be congenital malformation and sacrum rotation. Segmental undercorrection and placing a more central and even UIV were wise strategies for congenital EOS with severe Sacral Slanting. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Pedicle screws have been used for posterior spinal fixation since the free hand technique was first reported in 1959. Multiple methods have since been developed to facilitate more accurate screw placement, such as stereotactic-guiding and intraoperative fluoroscopy, though they also increase radiation exposure and operative interval. Pedicle screws remain technically demanding to place. Aberrant screws can lead to serious neurovascular complications, including radicular pain, sensory loss, damage to great vessels, and damage to the pleural cavity. We propose that a predominant factor of pedicle screw breach is due to the inherent vertebral anatomy involved at a given spinal level. While it has been suggested that vertebrae morphology can influence breach incidence, there has never been a clear link made between isthmus size and the rate of pedicle screw breach. The study aims to investigate the inverse correlation between breach incidence and vertebral isthmus width. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> We retrospectively reviewed the post-operative computed tomography (CT) scans of 91 patients who underwent thoracolumbar (T2-L5) surgery at the Jewish General Hospital. Average patient age was 62.9 years and the patients were 58% male and 42% female. Radiologically detectable breach incidence was computed and a Fisher exact test was performed. Each breach was also categorized as minor ( < 2 mm) or major ( > 2 mm). Clinical correlation was not a requirement for presence of breach. Isthmus width is defined as the narrowest portion of the pedicle in the mediolateral plan. The average isthmus width by spinal level, reported by Zindrick in 1986, was then compared to the collected breach incidences by spinal level. A regression analysis and Pearson’s correlation was performed. <h4>Results:</h4> A total of 656 pedicle screws were analyzed and 233 radiologically detectable breaches were found, though only 8 patients developed post-operative symptoms clinically relevant to the detected breach. The average incidence of breach was 35.5%, while the average incidence of major breach was 8.6%. Breach incidence was over two times higher in the thoracic than the lumbar spine while major breach incidence was three times higher (Fisher exact test, P < .0001). A lateral breach was three times less likely to occur than a medial breach, though it was twice as likely to be a major breach (Fisher exact test, P < .0001). The two spinal levels with the thinnest average isthmus width - T4 and T5 - had the highest breach incidence, whereas the two spinal levels with the thickest average isthmus width – L4 and L5 – had the lowest breach incidence. Breach incidence and isthmus width were shown to have a significant inverse correlation with an R squared of 0.7 (Pearson’s correlation, P < .0001). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> A thinner vertebral isthmus width significantly increases the pedicle screw breach incidence. The smaller size and complex pedicle morphology of the thoracic spine was breached over two times more frequently than the larger pedicles of the lumbar spine, which allow for more degrees of freedom. Despite the high incidence of cortical bone violation observed, there was little correlation with clinical symptoms and we were unable to conclude the absolute size of breach necessary for symptoms to develop. A breach is not automatically a clinical problem, provided the screw remains structurally sound and the patient symptomless. One must consider every case uniquely. Image-guided assistance may be most useful where breach incidence is highest and isthmus width is lowest, particularly between T3 and T6. <h4>Introduction:</h4> The thoracic spine is considered as a semi-rigid region in human spine. Several studies have reported dynamic changes of the thoracic spine in terms of motion and cross-sectional area of the thoracic spinal cord. The movement of thoracic spinal cord within dural sac and the change in mid-sagittal diameter in correlation with positional changed is still unknown. The aims of this study were (1) to evaluate the dynamic change of anterior and posterior Space Available for Cord (SAC) of the thoracic spinal cord in the dural sac in three position, neutral, flexion, and extension, and (2) to evaluate the dynamic change of the thoracic spinal cord in mid-sagittal diameter in three positions. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> 118 patients (66 males and 52 females, mean age of 45.6 ± 10.6) who underwent thoracic spine kMRI were evaluated from T4/5 to T11/12 in flexion, neutral, and extension positions. The anterior SAC, posterior SAC, and mid-sagittal thoracic cord diameter were measure at the level of each intervertebral disc from T4-5 to T11-12. The anterior SAC is the distance from posterior borders of the disc to the anterior border of the thoracic cord. The posterior SAC is the distance from the posterior border of the thoracic cord to the anterior border of the posterior column at each level. The mid-sagittal cord diameter is the distance between anterior and posterior border of thoracic cord, and was measured in the mid-sagittal plane of the MRI. The Friedman’s test was used to test the statistical significance for each parameter in three positions, then Wilcoxon-signed-rank test was used for post-hoc analysis. P-value of less than 0.0167 was considered statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. <h4>Results:</h4> Between three positions, there were statistically significant differences in anterior SAC at levels T8-9 to T11-12 (p < 0.001 at T9-10 to T11-12, p = 0.001 at T8-9). The posterior SAC also showed statistically significant difference between three positions at T4-5, T7-8, T8-9 and T9-10 level. For mid-sagittal cord diameter, there were statistically significant differences between three positions at T4-5, T6-7, T8-9, T9-10, and T10-11 (p < 0.01). After post-hoc analysis, the anterior SAC in flexion position was significantly narrower than in the neutral and in the extension position at T8-9 to T11-12 level. The T8-9 level had significantly wider posterior SAC in flexion than in the neutral position. Thoracic spinal cord mid-sagittal diameter significantly increased in flexion position when compared to the neutral position at T8-9, T9-10, and T11-12 level. On the other hand, thoracic cord at T4-5 in extension position was significantly narrower than in the neutral position. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Thoracic spinal cord changed in shape and position in the dural sac during positional changes. In flexion position, the thoracic cord at T8-9 and below tended to move anteriorly closer to posterior vertebral body and intervertebral disc. The thoracic cord, itself, increased in mid-sagittal diameter in flexion position at the levels below T8-9. In flexion position there is a higher chance of spinal cord compression if there are lesion in the anterior epidural space, especially at the levels below T8-9. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Long segment fusion is often utilized in the treatment of symptomatic spinal deformity. Proximal junction kyphosis (PJK) (Kyphotic Cobb angle > 15 degrees) can lead to proximal junctional failure, and has revision surgery rates reported up to 27% within 6 months following primary surgery. As cited in our previous study, the use of a tapered dose of prophylactic bone in UIV (T10), UIV+1 (T9) and UIV+2 (T8) in an instrumented T10-S1 model, which eliminated fractures at T7 (supra adjacent to the augmented T8 vertebra). The tapered dose of bone cement and the disc spaces may buffer axial forces, allowing for a smoother load transfer through the segments. The optimal dose and configuration of the tapered dose of bone cement has also been cited in our previous study. In this current parametric study, we explore the effects of the bone cement placed near the upper and lower end plates and distributed vertically or horizontally in the adjacent proximal vertebrae. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A validated FE model from T6-pelvis was used for the analyses. An osteoporotic model was developed and modified by insertion of pedicle screws and rods from T10 to S1, therein simulating the standard surgical procedure in-silico. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement was injected in the UIV (T10), UIV+1 (T9) and UIV+2 (T8). 2.5 cc of cement was injected in T10, 2 cc in T9 and 1 cc in T8 near the upper endplate, lower endplate, distributed in a vertical direction and a horizontal direction in the vertebrae. The load was applied to a metal bock 10 mm anterior to the center of the vertebra to simulate flexion moment and the pelvis was fixed. The stresses at the end plates from T7 to T10 were analyzed. <h4>Results:</h4> Except for 3.8% increase at the T7 inferior endplate for the bone cement placed near the upper endplates, lower stresses were observed when the cement was placed near the upper endplates as compared to placement near the lower endplates, ranging from 3% to 20.5% at the T9 superior endplate. Lower stresses were observed at all endplates for horizontal cement distribution as compared to vertical cement distribution. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Our data suggests bone cement should be injected close to the upper endplates and not the lower endplates, to decrease endplate stresses and thus the risk of vertebral fractures. Additionally, as compared to vertically distributed cement, bone cement should be spread horizontally to reduce endplate stresses and thus reducing the risk of compression fractures. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Surgical decompression and stabilization followed by radiosurgery represents an effective method for local tumor control and neurologic preservation for patients with metastatic epidural spinal cord compression. We have previously demonstrated improvement in HrQOL after this combined modality treatment (“hybrid therapy”). The current analysis focuses on delineation of patient-specific prognostic factors predictive of HrQOL change after combined surgery-SRS treatment of MESCC. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> This is a prospective, single-center, cohort study. One hundred and eleven patients with MESCC who underwent separation surgery followed by SRS were included. Prognostic factors associated with improved patient reported outcome (PRO) measures. PRO tools, i.e. Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and MD Anderson Symptom Inventory – Spine Tumor (MDASI-SP), both validated in the cancer population, were prospectively collected. Numeric prognostic factors were correlated with PRO measures using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Categorical prognostic factors were correlated with PRO measures using the Wilcoxon two-sample test (for two categories) or the Kruskal-Wallis test (for three or more categories). All statistical tests were two-sided with a level of significance < 0.05 for correlation of prognostic factors with PRO constructs and a level of significance < 0.0014 for correlation of prognostic factors with PRO items. Statistical analyses were done in SAS (version 9.4, Cary, NC). <h4>Results:</h4> One hundred and eleven patients were included in this analysis. Patients with lower pre-operative Medical Research Council (MRC) motor scores experienced a greater decrease in symptom interference (BPI Interference construct (p = 0.03), and individual functional measures including general activity (p = 0.001), walking (p = 0.001) and normal work (p = 0.006)). Lumbar location was associated with better outcomes than cervical or thoracic as noted on the BPI pain experience construct (p = 0.03) and MDASI-SP interference (p = 0.01) and core symptom (p = 0.002) constructs. Patients with ASIA scores of C or D benefit more than those with ASIA E on BPI Interference construct (p = 0.04)). Patients with higher ECOG scores at presentation benefit more than those with low ECOG scores on MDASI-SP interference construct, (p = 0.03)). Women benefit more than men on BPI interference (p = 0.03) and pain experience (p = 0.04) constructs. Patients with prior spinal surgery at the current level of interest benefit less than those which are naïve surgical patients in MDASI-SP interference construct, (p = 0.04). <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Delineation of patient characteristics associated with HrQOL improvement provides crucial information for patient selection, patient education and setting treatment expectations. For patients with MESCC treated with hybrid therapy using surgery and radiosurgery, the presence of neurological deficits and diminished performance status, lumbar tumor level and female gender were associated with greater PRO improvement. <h4>Introduction:</h4> This meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety in cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for treating cervical degenerative disc diseases (CDDDs). <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> The authors searched RCTs in the electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, Embase, Springer Link, Web of Knowledge, OVID and Google Scholar) from their establishment to march 2016 without language restrictions. We also manually searched the reference lists of articles and reviews for possible relevant studies. Researches on CDA versus ACDF in CDDDs were selected in this meta-analysis. The quality of all studies was assessed and effective data was pooled for this meta-analysis. Outcome measurements were surgical parameters (operative time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay), clinical indexes (neck disability index (NDI), neurological success, range of motion (ROM), Visual Analogue Score (VAS)), complications (the number of adverse events, adjacent segment disease (ASD), and reoperation). Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias assessment were also performed, respectively. The meta-analysis was performed with software RevMan 5.3. <h4>Results:</h4> 37 articles (20 RCTs) with a total 4123 patients (1762 in the CDA and 1472 in the ACDF) met inclusion criteria. Eight types of disc prostheses were used in the included studies. Patients were followed up for at least two years in all the studies. No statistically significant differences were found between CDA and ACDF for blood loss (SMD -0.02; 95% CI (−0.20, 0.17)), length of hospital stay (MD -0.06; 95% CI (−0.19, 0.06)). Statistical differences were found between operative time (MD 14.22; 95% CI (6.73, 21.71)), NDI (SMD −0.27; 95% CI (−0.43, −0.10)), neurological success (RR 1.13; 95%CI (1.08, 1.18)), ROM (MD 6.72; 95%CI (5.72, 7.71)), VAS of neck (SMD -0.40; 95%CI (−0.75, −0.04)), VAS of arm (SMD −0.55; 95%CI (-1.04, -0.06)), the rate of adverse events (RR 0.72 95% CI (0.53, 0.96)), the rate of ASD (RR 0.62; 95% CI (0.43, 0.88)), and reoperation (RR 0.50; 95% CI (0.39, 0.63)). Subgroup analysis stratified by different types of disc prostheses was also performed. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> CDA is associated with higher clinical indexes and fewer complications than ACDF, indicating that it is a safe and effective treatment for CDDDs. However, the operative time of CDA is longer than ACDF and NDI score of CDA is lower than ACDF. Because of some limitations, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Additional studies are needed. Large, definitive RCTs are needed. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Despite retrospective studies that have shown that longer packed red blood cell (PRBC) storage duration worsens patient outcomes, randomized clinical trials have found no difference in outcomes. However, no studies have examined the impact of giving the oldest blood (28 days-old or more) on morbidity within spine surgery. Our objective in this study was to describe the association between storage duration of PRBCs and perioperative adverse events in patients undergoing spine surgery at a tertiary care center. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> The surgical administrative database at our institution was queried for patients transfused with PRBCs who underwent spine surgery between December 4, 2008 and June 26, 2015. Patients undergoing spinal fusion, tumor-related surgeries, and other identified spine surgeries were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on storage duration of blood transfused: exclusively ≤ 28 days’ storage or exclusively > 28 days’ storage. The primary outcome was composite in-hospital morbidity, which included: (1) infection, (2) thrombotic event, (3) renal injury, (4) respiratory event, and/or (5) ischemic event. <h4>Results:</h4> In total, 1,141 patients who received a transfusion were included for analysis in this retrospective study; 710 were transfused exclusively with PRBCs ≤ 28 days’ storage and 431 exclusively with PRBCs > 28 days’ storage. Perioperative complications occurred in 119 patients (10.4%). Patients who received blood stored for > 28 days had higher odds of developing any one complication (odds ratio [OR] = 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-2.74; P = 0.005) even after adjusting for competing perioperative risk factors. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Blood stored for > 28 days is independently associated with higher odds of developing perioperative complications in patients transfused during spinal surgery. Our results suggest that blood storage duration may be an appropriate parameter to consider when developing institutional transfusion guidelines that seek to optimize patient outcomes. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Currently the UK national screening committee does not recommend screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). In two tertiary spinal centres serving two different but large geographical areas, we investigated first presentation of AIS and the potential impact that introducing a school prevention programme (SPP) may have. In light of evidence for bracing as well as new technology for the growing spine including vertebral body tethering there is a real need to re-explore school screening. <h4>Methods:</h4> Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital and St. George’s Hospital performed a retrospective case review of all new children referred over a 2-year period (2015-16) was performed, noting age at presentation, aetiology, curve magnitude, Risser grade, and intention to treat on first consultation. Four groups of patients were identified: early onset idiopathic ( < 10 years), syndromic (any age), adolescent patients with a potential to treat with a brace according to the SRS bracing criteria, or adolescents too skeletally mature or with curves beyond bracing criteria. <h4>Results:</h4> Of 488 cases, 286 were diagnosed with scoliosis (Cobb > 10°), 66% (n = 189) female. 26 with early onset scoliosis, mean Cobb angle of 37.7° and 37 patients in the syndromic group, mean Cobb of 44° respectively. We identified that of 57 patients with AIS and Risser grade 0-2 of which 11.1% (n = 32) were within bracing range, and 8.7% (n = 25) were beyond bracing magnitude. 58% (n = 166) with Risser grade 3-5. 30% (n = 87) curves too large to brace. <h4>Discussion:</h4> Fusion of the spine for scoliosis is an invasive treatment carrying significant morbidity. Only 11.1% of first presentation AIS fulfilled the SRS criteria for bracing. Following publication of level I evidence demonstrating that bracing is effective at altering the natural history of AIS and the results of this study give a good snapshot of current incidence, strongly supporting the need to introduce a school prevention programme in the U.K. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Early onset scoliosis (EOS) was first described in 1936 and since then, the concept had been evolving. Nowadays, EOS is used to depict a deviation of more than 10° in the frontal plain measured by Cobb’s method. Previous treatment options included premature spine fixation, leading to cardiopulmonary complications and short torso syndrome. The advent of new treatment choices has resulted in diminishing of those ancient complications and better quality of life for children. Two of the most popular systems are growing rods and Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Rib (VEPTR); however these new systems has its own complications such as infections, skin and neurological damage and high rate of surgical interventions. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> An observational cross sectional study comparing patients with EOS diagnosis, who underwent surgical correction using growing rods or VEPTR systems between 2010 and 2016 in an IV level Orthopedics children Institute were evaluated. A non-probabilistic sampling was performed. Statistical analysis was performed with STATA v14 Statistics program. <h4>Results:</h4> 54 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age at intervention were 6.6 and 6 years old for rods and VEPTR groups respectively. Mean Cobb angle was 62.9 for rods group and 66.4 for VEPTR. Gender distribution was as follows 7:3 and 6.5:4.5 for Rods and VEPTR. The groups were matched for every variable. Regarding the correction of the spine deformity, both systems achieved a statically significant value (Growing Rods p < 0.00 001 VEPTR p < 0.01; however, when compared with each other, growing rods achieved the best correction with statistical significance p < 0.04. Mean time between consecutive elongation surgeries was 11 months. No difference was noted between primary outcomes, including complications and only important difference were found in secondary variables without the possibility of establishing the individual value. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> EOS is challenging for spine surgeon due to the complexity of patients and additional comorbidities. Nowadays elongations systems are the mainstay of treatment. Growing rods and VEPTR systems are the most widespread worldwide. Growing Rods appears to better correct deformity without increase in complications, making it a more efficient system. Current literature recommends surgery every 9-12 months in contrast with previous concept of every 6 months, obtaining same clinical outcome with lower complications rates. <h4>Introduction:</h4> There is preclinical data indicating that early decompression in spinal cord injury (SCI) can improve outcome. Fehlings et al has shown in the STASCIS study the there is an advantage in decompression under 24 hours in cervical spine fractures. Our objective was to evaluate the relative effectiveness of surgery done under 12 hours from traumatic SCI. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A retrospective review of all patients admitted to a level one trauma center with SCI between 01/2006 to 02/2017, we included patients who were surgically treated within 48 hours of admission with 6 month or more follow up. Patients’ medical records were reviewed for location of vertebra fracture, presence of acute spinal cord injury, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, time to surgery (group A: less than 12 hours, group B: 12-24 hours, group C: 24-48 hours), length of hospital stay, ASIA impairment scale before surgery, after surgery, and at long term follow up. The neurological outcome was compared to the results present in the STASCIS study. <h4>Results:</h4> 49 patients (35 males: 14 females) with SCI were admitted and surgically treated within 48 hours of admission. Mean age at admission was 36 years (range 15-79 years). The mean follow up was 30 months (range 7-110 months). 50% were injured in motor vehicle accident while 48% due to falls. 37 were operated within 12 hours (average- 5.5 hours (range 1.5-11), 7 were operated between 12-24 hours and 5 were operated after 24 hours. At long term follow up after surgery, 55% of patients with acute spinal cord injury had been improved in their ASIA scale. After Surgery, in group A 67.5% of patients improved in their ASIA score (P = 0.06 when compared to under 24 hours in the STASCIS study) with 41% with a 2 grade or more improvement in their ASIA scores (P < 0.01 when compared to under 24 hours in the STASCIS study), in group B 44% of patients improved in their ASIA, while in group C only 40% of patients improved in their ASIA score (none of them had ≥ 2 grade improvement in their ASIA scores). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Early surgical intervention should be advised for patients with acute spinal cord injury. Surgery under 12 hours from the trauma should be recommended at as it is associated with improved outcome. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Surgery is increasingly recommended as the preferred treatment strategy for patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), as it can halt neurologic deterioration and significantly improve functional impairment, disability and quality of life. Despite objective post-operative clinical improvements, experience dictates that a proportion of patients remain dissatisfied with their outcome. Discrepancies between clinical measures and self-reported ratings of health status after surgery, often referred to as response shift, can be due changes in patients’ internal standards of measurement, values and/or conceptualization of quality of life. This study aims to investigate the presence of response shift in functional outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for DCM. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Four hundred and seventy-nine DCM patients were prospectively enrolled in the AOSpine-CSM-International study at 16 global sites. Functional impairment, disability and quality of life were evaluated at baseline and 1-year following surgery. Patients were also asked to complete the SF-36 questionnaire and to rate their general health status compared to one year ago (much better, somewhat better, the same, somewhat worse, much worse). Descriptive analyses were conducted to evaluate the concordance between achieving a clinically important improvement (MCID) in function (modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) scale) and self-reported ratings of health status. Concordance was defined as achieving a MCID and reporting general health as somewhat better or much better, whereas discordance was defined as achieving a MCID and reporting general health as the same, somewhat worse or much worse. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine important differences between patients with discrepancies between their clinical measures and self-reported ratings and those without. <h4>Results:</h4> Four-hundred-one patients had complete follow-up data at 1-year and were included in this analysis. Based on patient self-reports, 55 patients were somewhat or much worse than a year ago, 82 patients were the same and 264 patients were somewhat or much better. Thirty-one percent of patients who reported being somewhat or much worse achieved a MCID on the mJOA. In addition, 56% of patients who indicated their health status was the same as one year ago exhibited clinically meaningful improvements in functional impairment. Univariate analyses indicated that there is an increased likelihood of observing a discrepancy between functional outcomes and self-reported ratings if the patient (1) exhibited less improvement in mJOA upper extremity scores (p = 0.071), (2) was older (p = 0.0073), (3) was a smoker (p = 0.082) and (4) achieved lower total mJOA scores at 1-year (p = 0.087). Following multivariate analysis, the most important factors were age and improvement in mJOA upper extremity scores. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> A response shift in functional outcomes was detected in patients undergoing surgery for DCM. Older patients, as well as those with smaller improvements in postoperative upper extremity scores, tend to report worsened or unchanged general health status, in spite of experiencing clinically significant improvement in overall post-operative function. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Presently, spine professionals use a static image to assist in surgical planning and patient education. However, the spine is not a static object. While the soft tissue anatomy of the spine is well elucidated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the flexible, dynamic nature of the spine is difficult to visualize and portray, especially to patients. Therefore, the goal of this study was to implement spine kinematics and common degenerative pathologies in an interactive virtual reality (VR) program and determine its efficacy in improving patient education and communication. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> We developed a library of digital 3D models of spinal anatomy that can be visualized and manipulated within a virtual environment. A generic healthy model of the spine was created using the Autodesk Maya® modeling software. Kinematics parameters were informed using published literature [1]. Clinical cases depicting degenerative pathology were likewise modeled after patient examples. These models were animated and exported to a Unity Game Engine application, which was run on a Samsung Gear VR headset. IRB approval was obtained and patients seen at the UCLA Spine Center were provided with the headset during their consultation. A survey was administered at the conclusion of the visit to quantify patient satisfaction and gauge the patients’ understanding of the relevant discussed anatomy. <h4>Results:</h4> Spine professionals can easily guide and educate patients regarding spinal anatomy and degenerative pathologies in an immersive VR environment. The scenario’s that present foraminal stenosis and central canal stenosis due to disk bulging and ligament hypertrophy were reported to be most useful by patients. Likewise, the kinematic model of the spine allowing visualization of lumbar flexion and extension enabled physician to better explain these dynamic states of the spine to the patients. No adverse events were observed and preliminary data from surveys demonstrates high patient satisfaction with the educational content and experience. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Unlike static 2D medical images, VR allows people to immerse themselves in an educational environment that is difficult to create in real life, such as the inside of a spinal canal. The visualizations included color-coded anatomy, animations, and interactive movement based on real patient information. Patients not only improved their understanding of the pathology, but the technology enabled patients to feel more confident overall about their diagnosis. Future work will determine if this understanding and confidence will translate to improved patient consent prior to surgical interventions, preparation for post-operation safety needs, and reduced readmissions [2, 3, 4]. Furthermore, our aim is to ultimately present patients with 3D VR models that are personalized with their pathology, which can then be used for surgical planning also by surgeons. References 1.

While surgical intervention is often recommended1, obtaining an MRI prior to going to the operating room is at the discretion of the treating surgeon. MRI has been shown to be useful in determining the extent of soft-tissue damage in spinal trauma, but each study did not distinguish whether or not a spinal cord injury was present.2-4 <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A survey of 127 spine surgeons was conducted to determine whether or not operative treatment plans were directly changed by the availability of MRI imaging studies in patients who had thoracolumbar burst fractures (T10-L1) and incomplete spinal cord injuries. The patients for this study (n = 10) were identified by searching the Department of Radiology’s diagnosis database for the diagnosis of burst fracture and both CT and MRI studies that were obtained prior to any surgical interventions. The admission history and physical exam for each of these patients was also reviewed to determine whether or not an incomplete spinal cord injury was present at the time of initial evaluation. The axial and sagittal CT studies as well as the initial history and physical for each of these 10 patients were deidentified and presented to the surgeons participating in the survey. Each participant was then asked to formulate a surgical plan. Once a surgical plan was formulated based on the CT scan, they were asked whether or not an MRI was desired and why. The axial and sagittal T2 MRI scan images were then presented. The surgeons were then asked whether or not this altered their initial surgical plan. <h4>Results:</h4> Of those surveyed, 66% were practicing as Orthopaedic and 34% as Neurosurgery trained spine surgeons. The majority (66%) of those responding to the survey have been in practice greater than 10-years. In the patient population presented, after reviewing the initial CT scan, 41% of respondents stated that they would like to obtain an MRI before proceeding to the operating room. This was desired to evaluate for discoligamentous injuries adjacent to the fractured segment, to determine if anterior only treatment is sufficient or due to suspicion of adjacent bony injury not evident on CT scan. After reviewing the MRI, 19% of all respondents stated that their previous surgical plan had been changed. Out of the 41% of respondents that desired a MRI scan after evaluating the CT scan, 45% stated that they had changed their surgical plan. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The majority of the time (59%), respondents did not feel that an MRI was necessary for operative planning. Eighty-one percent of the time, MRI made no difference in planned treatment. The MRI was most often desired due to it being the standard protocol of the treating institution or to evaluate the posterior ligamentous complex. In conclusion, the operative treatment of patients with thoraco-lumbar burst fractures is changed in 1 out of 5 patients by imaging the injured levels with an MRI. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Spinal segment arthrodesis has become a widely accepted treatment for degenerative disorders of the lumbar spine. However spinal fusion alters the normal biomechanics of the spine and eliminates mobile segments causing overload of adjacent segments. In recent years, increasing importance in degenerative decompensation of the adjacent segment after lumbar fusion is attached to spino-pelvic malalignment. At the same time, according to some authors, the overload of the adjacent segment in conditions of a PI-LL parameter mismatch exceeding 11° leads to the ASD development. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> This prospective study evaluated 86 patients who were treated from 2011 to 2013 for lumbar canal stenosis with TLIF. All patients had preop PI-LL mismatch greater than 11° with no other global balance disturbance (SVA < 4 cm, PT < 20°). All patients had one level fusion with pedicle screws and TLIF with interbody PEEK cage. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the operative technique. First group consisted of 42 patients with minimal invasive bilateral facet joint resection, pedicle screw fixation and TLIF. Second group included 44 patients with operational technique aimed at the lumbar lordosis increasing. These patients were treated with Smith-Peterson osteotomy and TLIF with the most anterior cage position. The average follow-up was 44 months (36-62 months). <h4>Results:</h4> There were no statistically significant differences in operative time, blood loss and postop pain level between two groups. Comparison of the pre- and postoperative values within the groups showed significant differences in the second group for lumbar lordosis (p = 0.037). Summary in the I group symptomatic ASD was found in 14 cases (33.3%) during all follow-up period with 85.7% frequently of revision surgery. In the II group symptomatic ASD was identified in 2 patients (4.5%), one of them needed revision surgery. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The described technique of operative treatment allows to achieve an increase in lumbar lordosis up to 10 degrees on one segment without increasing surgery trauma. This technique has shown a statistically significant (p = 0.012) prevention of ASD development in patients with PI-LL mismatch. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency can lead to a form of myelopathy known as subacute combined degeneration (SCD), which is characterized by damage to the dorsal and lateral columns of the spinal cord. Nitrous oxide is an inhaled anesthetic which irreversibly oxidizes the cobalt ion of vitamin B12, interfering with its function as a key coenzyme. Although a number of individual case reports have described the development of SCD following nitrous oxide anesthesia, it is unknown what factors predispose patients to SCD or are predictive of long-term recovery. In this study, we conduct a systematic literature review of reported cases of SCD following nitrous oxide anesthesia. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> A medical librarian performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases after consultation with the lead authors and a Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) analysis of key articles provided by the research team. The final searches retrieved a total of 339 references, which were pooled in EndNote and de-duplicated to 148. 4 further studies were identified by examining the reference lists of all included articles. Two separate screeners (KP and AN) evaluated the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the eligible articles in a standardized manner. The following data were extracted from each eligible article: patient characteristics, the duration of nitrous oxide anesthesia, neurological findings, laboratory values, imaging factors, treatment, and recovery. Mann-Whitney U tests, Independent T-tests, and Chi Square tests were performed, with significance considered at p < 0.05 and trends considered at p < 0.15. <h4>Results:</h4> Our systematic search identified 152 unique articles. After screening these articles by title, abstract, and full-text, a total of 32 studies, reporting a total of 39 cases of nitrous oxide-induced SCD, were deemed relevant. These cases included 22 male patients and 17 female patients, with an average age of 51.3 years (SD 17.6). An etiology for subclinical deficiency, including pernicious anemia, atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, ileal resection, Crohn’s Disease, and nutritional deficiency, was determined in 31 reports, while there was no evidence of pre-operative deficiency in 8 reports. Duration of nitrous oxide exposure was described in 19 reports, and ranged from 30 minutes to 11 hours. Univariate analysis failed to find any association between post-operative recovery and age (p = 0.41), sex (p = 0.48), positive MRI findings (p = 0.42), and post-operative serum B12 (p = 0.96). However, there was a tendency of post-operative high Hemoglobin (p = 0.09) and post-operative high Mean Corpuscular Volume (p = 0.14) to relate with worse neurological recovery. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Given the high prevalence of subclinical B12 deficiency and the potential for relatively short exposures to nitrous oxide to precipitate SCD, it is imperative that surgeons remain aware of this process. In patients with postsurgical myelopathy, the physician should evaluate serum B12 and consider the possibility that nitrous oxide could cause a subclinical B12 deficiency to become overt. Further, we recommend screening patients undergoing surgery for risk factors or signs of B12 deficiency to avoid post-operative myelopathy. Since we were limited by a small cohort in this study, the trends identified here will be important to study further with larger patient populations.",EuropePMC

,Adolescent Scoliosis 1A001: Radiographic Results of Selecting the Touched Vertebra as the Lowest Instrumented Vertebra in Lenke Type 1 (Main Thoracic) & Type 2 (Double Thoracic) Curves at a Minimum 5-year Follow-up,"<h4>Introduction:</h4> A prior study showed the touched vertebra (TV), defined as the most cephalad thoracolumbar/lumbar vertebra “touched” by the center sacral vertical line (CSVL), as a potential landmark vertebra & recommended lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV) as well. We evaluated a large cohort of Lenke type 1 & 2 cases to determine if selecting the TV as the LIV will produce optimal positioning at a min. 5 yrs postoperative. Our hypothesis was that it would and that fusing short of the TV would lead to a suboptimal result. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> 299 pts with Lenke 1 (n = 207) or Lenke 2 (n = 92) AIS curves at a min. 5 yr f/u were evaluated. The TV was selected on the preoperative x-ray by 2 independent examiners & confirmed for agreement. The LIV selected was compared to the preoperative TV as well as the LIV-CSVL distance at min. 5 yr f/u. Comparison was made on the LIV-CSVL distance in pts fused short of the TV, to the TV or distal to the TV using standard statistical software. <h4>Results:</h4> When comparing the entire cohort, differences in 5 yr LIV-CSVL absolute values between the 3 groups approached, but did not reach, significance (P = .055). In a subanalysis of the lumbar A modifiers (n = 161), main effect ANOVA indicated a significant difference among the 3 groups (P = .002). Post hoc comparison revealed that pts fused short of the TV (TV-1) had significantly greater LIV-CSVL distance values than those fused to the TV (P = .006) & those fused distal to the TV (TV+1, P = .002). There was no significant difference among the 3 groups when looking at lumbar B (n = 76, p = 0.424) & lumbar C (n = 62, P = .326) modifiers. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Selecting the touched vertebra (TV) as the LIV for Lenke type 1A & 2A curves produced optimal LIV positioning at a minimum 5 yrs postoperative, while fusing short of the TV showed statistically increased LIV- CSVL translation. Understanding & utilizing the TV rule assists the surgeon in proper LIV selection in Lenke type 1A & 2A curve patterns for AIS. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Laminoplasty first described by Tsuji in 1982 as an alternative to laminectomy as the treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy CSM. The technique was developed in an effort to eliminate the development of instability and kyphosis following laminectomy while achieving minimal reduction in cervical range of movement (ROM) compare to fusion. In the late 1990’s, spinal surgeons experimented the use of maxillofacial fixation plates as an alternative to sutures, anchors and local spinous process auto-grafts to provide a more rigid and lasting fixation of laminoplasty. This eventually led to the advent of laminoplasty mini-plates, which are currently used. <h4>Objective:</h4> Is to compare laminoplasty with plate and without plate techniques in terms of functional outcome results. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed to evaluate the current available literatures in an attempt to justify the use of plate in laminoplasty. Given the relatively high costs associated with the use of these plates and limited available data in the literatures about laminoplasty techniques and outcome. <h4>Results:</h4> The principal finding of this study was that there was no statistically significant difference in clinical outcome between the two different techniques of Laminoplasty. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> There is no enough evidence in the Literatures to support one technique over the other and hence there is no evidence to support change in practice (using or not using the plate in laminoplasty). Randomized control trial will give better comparison between the two groups. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Some studies have indicated PS fixation at UIV is thought to be a possible risk factor of PJF. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively compare the incidence of acute PJF between transverse hook fixation at UIV and PS following ASD surgery. <h4>Methods:</h4> Forty-seven ASD patients who underwent corrective surgery by a single surgeon were retrospectively reviewed with a minimum 1-year follow-up. The mean age was 67.6 years old (42-83) and the follow-up period was 36.9 months (12-95). T9 as UIV was selected in 17 patients and T10 in 30 patients. Transverse hook was used in 26 patients, and PS was used in 21 patients. Radiographic parameters including SVA, PI-LL, PT, and proximal junctional angle (PJA) were measured before surgery (PreO) and latest follow-up period (PO). Fracture risk was also evaluated using FRAX (WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool) before surgery. Acute PJF was defined as UIV and UIV+1 fracture, implant failure or PJK > 15° within the first six months. We compared the several data between the hook group and the PS group with statistical software. <h4>Results:</h4> The hook group had an acute PJF rate of 19.2% compared to 28.5% in the PS group (P = .20). The mechanisms of acute PJF are as follows; there were 4 patients with UIV fracture and 1 patient with implant failures in the hook group, and there were 6patients with UIV fracture in the PS group. Radiographic parameters in the hook group (PreO/PO) were following; SVA; 119.1/39.1 mm, PI-LL; 46.4/4.6°, and PT;35.8/21.9°. Those in the PS group were as follows; SVA; 92.3/37.3 mm, PI-LL; 37.6/4.5°, and PT;31.9/21.8°. FRAX were 13.7% in the hook group and 13.4% in the PS group. There were no differences in baseline data between the two groups. However, the changes of PJA in the PS group were significantly higher than those in the hook group (7.4/2.9°; P = .05). To analyze the PJA data in the patients with Acute PJF, the changes of PJA were significantly higher in the PS group than those in the hook group (17.0/6.3°; P = .04). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Our study doesn’t show that transverse hook as UIV instrument can prevent acute PJF. However, using hook at UIV can prevent the vertebral collapse if UIV fracture occurs. The increased risk of collapse of UIV fracture in the PS group in this study may due to higher mechanical load to UIV using PS. Further biomechanical study should be necessary to clarify our results. <h4>Introduction:</h4> The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of different doses rhBMP-2 on bone healing in an ovine lumbar interbody fusion model. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> In this study 22 sheep underwent two level lumbar interbody fusion using a ventrolateral approach with secondary dorsal fixation at L1/2 and L3/4. After randomization in one level a PEEK-cage was implanted filled with one of three doses rhBMP-2 (0,5 mg; 1 mg; 2 mg) delivered on an ACS. The other level received an empty PEEK-cage or ACS filled cage. Animals were sacrificed after 3 and 6 months and decalcified histology was performed. This included histomorphological analysis as well as histomorphometry of the tissues within the cage. <h4>Results:</h4> At 3 months after surgery the groups treated with rhBMP-2 showed higher amounts of bone tissue within the cage. At 6 months the amounts of bone tissue increased in all groups, but were still lower in the groups without growth factor. At 3 months there was only one active osteolysis in the cage/ACS. 7 of 8 segments of the rhBMP-2 groups had a compromised bone structure around the implant. These areas were filled with fibrous tissue and fibrocartilage. This finding was not detected in the groups without rhBMP-2 at 3 months. At 6 months most of the segments with an empty cage or cage/ACS showed a chronic inflammation. Predominant cells were macrophages and giant cells. The groups treated with rhBMP-2 showed only a few mild chronic inflammatory reactions. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The well-known dose dependent effect of rhBMP-2 on bone healing could also be recognized in our study. Attention has to be payed for the proinflammatory properties of the growth factor. Consistent with other studies we found 2 strong inflammatory reactions, each one in the lowest and highest dose group. Also the potential for causing transient bone resorptions, according to the results of others, was demonstrated. At 3 months 7 of 8 segments treated with rhBMP-2 showed compromised peri-implant bone. Osteoblasts, but not osteoclasts, were seen in the periphery of these areas. It can be concluded that there where bone resorptions which already merged into an increased osteoblastic activity. Usually resorptions occur between 2 and 12 weeks and are followed by a period of increased osteoblastic activity. This finding wasn’t recognized at 6 months anymore. Striking is that at 6 months most of the segments without rhBMP-2 showed a compromised bone structure around the implant with a mild to mainly moderate chronic inflammatory reaction. This cannot be attributed to the growth factor. Also the ACS is degraded at 6 months and is unlikely a possible explanation. Therefore, the cage as a reason must be considered and it has to be questioned whether PEEK is the optimal material for interbody cages. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Treatment options for pediatric cervical injuries include external immobilization and surgical fusion. Differences in the operative vs. non-operative treatment outcomes of different cervical injury locations (atlantoaxial vs. subaxial) has not been adequately addressed among pediatric patients. In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database to compare complication rates for cervical injuries after external fixation or spinal fusion in the pediatric population. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Patients under the age of 18 with a discharge diagnosis of cervical spine fracture without spinal cord injury or cervical spine subluxation were identified in the NIS database. Patients who were treated with internal fixation or external immobilization between 2002-2011 were included for analysis. Patients who did not undergo treatment and patients with unspecified fracture level were excluded. Discharge weights were applied and used to produce national estimates. Outcome data included length of stay, in-hospital mortality, discharge disposition, total hospital charges, and development of in-hospital complications. <h4>Results:</h4> A total of 2,878 pediatric patients with cervical spine injury were identified after application of discharge weights; 1,462 patients (50.8%) with atlantoaxial injury and 1,416 (49.2%) with subaxial spine injury. There were 1,037 atlantoaxial injury patients (70.9%) treated with external immobilization and 425 patients (29.1%) who underwent internal fixation. Significant differences between groups included total charges ($73,786 ± $107,108 for immobilization and $98,158 ± $86,548 for surgery, P = .040), and development of at least one complication (1.9% for immobilization and 6.8% for surgery, P = .029). Mortality (P = .363), length of stay (P = .221) and non-routine discharges (P = .106) were not different between groups. Among patients with subaxial injuries, there were 542 patients treated with external immobilization (38.3%) and 874 patients treated with surgery (61.7%). When comparing external immobilization to surgery for suabxial injury patients, there were no significant differences in sex (68.2% male vs. 65.4%, p = 0.622), primary payer (P = .493), injury mechanism (P = .234), length of stay (6.4 ± 6.7 days vs. 5.5 ± 5.2, P = .196), mortality (P = .430), non-routine discharges (P = .117), complication occurrence (P = .334), or total charges ($69,042 ± $83,614 for external immobilization vs. $83,123 ± $66,491 for surgery, P = .142). Patients with subluxation alone were treated more often with surgical fusion than with external immobilization (2.2% vs. 1.2%, P < .001). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The management of cervical spinal injuries in pediatric patients must be informed by the location of the injury. In patients with atlantoaxial injuries, the lower overall complication rate and decreased cost may warrant initial consideration of external fixation for treatment. Complication rates for subaxial injuries did not vary by treatment in this study, leaving both external immobilization and surgical fusion as two viable options for treatment. These results will help guide clinicians in their treatment decisions and support more cost-effective methods for managing cervical injuries. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Patients undergoing lumbar surgery often have depressive and anxiety symptoms. Long-term effects of surgery on these psychological symptoms have not been rigorously evaluated. This longitudinal study compared pre- and 2-year postoperative psychological symptoms in 276 lumbar surgery patients and assessed whether change in symptoms was associated with success of surgery. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Several days preop patients completed two psychological surveys, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (possible score 0-30, ≥11 is positive screen for depression) and the Spielberg State Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (possible score 20-80, population norms are used for comparison). Patients also completed the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) measuring disability from low back pain (possible score 0-100) and a validated Lumbar Surgery Expectations Survey measuring expected improvement for symptoms, function, and mental health (possible score 0-100). Medical comorbidity was obtained according to a standard index. Two years postop patients again completed the GDS, STAI, and ODI from the perspective of their current condition, and pre- to postop changes in score were calculated. Patients also reported new/worse comorbidity since surgery, and amount of improvement obtained for each expectation from which an overall proportion of expectations fulfilled was calculated (range 0 -1, higher = greater fulfillment). Improvement in GDS and STAI was defined as better psychological well-being. Success of surgery was defined as greater proportion of expectations fulfilled and improvement in ODI scores. <h4>Results:</h4> Mean age was 55 years, 56% were men, 78% had chronic spine conditions, 28% had major comorbidity preop, 19% reported new/worse comorbidity postop. Mean GDS scores were 9.8 (preop), 5.1 (postop), and 4.8 (within-patient change, P < .0001). More improvement in GDS scores was associated with a greater proportion of expectations fulfilled (P < .0001) and greater improvement in ODI scores (p<.0001). 41% preop screened positive for depression versus 16% postop (P < .0001). Compared to those who screened positive, those who screened negative postop had a greater proportion of expectations fulfilled (.33 vs .75, P < .0001), and a greater change in ODI scores (13 vs 34, P < .0001). Mean STAI scores were 40 (preop), 31 (postop), and 9 (within-patient change, P < .0001). More improvement in STAI scores was associated with a greater proportion of expectations fulfilled (P < .0001) and greater improvement in ODI scores (P < .0001). 59% preop had anxiety symptoms above population norms versus 26% postop (P = .002). Compared to those who were above population norms, those who were below population norms postop had a greater proportion of expectations fulfilled (.40 vs .79, P < .0001) and a greater change in ODI scores (15 vs 36, P < .0001). All associates persisted when controlled for pre- and postop comorbidity. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Traditionally, preoperative psychological symptoms have been assessed as predictors of outcomes of lumbar surgery. Our study demonstrated that outcomes of lumbar surgery, in turn, predict postoperative psychological well-being. The strengths of this study are its longitudinal design, use of within-patient change in scores for all measurements, use of patient-centered measurements, and control for pre- and postoperative comorbidity. This study provides evidence that successful lumbar surgery not only improves physical symptoms and function, but also improves psychological well-being. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Surgery involving a microscope or uniportal endoscope is now one of the most common types of minimally invasive spine surgeries performed worldwide. However, the procedure still has drawbacks related to its narrow view, steep learning curve, and technical problems. Recently, many preliminary or technical reports regarding biportal arthroscopic spinal surgery (BASS) have been published and have demonstrated that BASS can resolve these drawbacks. However, it would useful to determine the degree of paravertebral muscle injury after BASS using two portals and saline irrigation during the entire procedure. Therefore, we examined the radiological status of the paravertebral muscles after BASS. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A total of 48 patients were reexamined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to the recurrence of neurological symptoms during the follow-up period after BASS using a unilateral inter-laminar approach between September 2015 and March 2016. Of these, 30 patients diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis or lumbar disc herniation were included in this retrospective study. Patients with more than the two lesions required for surgery, previous lumbar surgery, spinal infections, or who underwent BASS via a trans-foraminal approach were excluded. We assessed the radiologic status of the paravertebral muscles by grading the extension of paravertebral muscle high signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images (0: normal, 1: partial, 2: total). The MR images were checked and graded on three occasions: preoperatively (aMRI_1), at 1 day after surgery (aMRI_2), and at the time the MRI was re-taken due to the recurrence of neurological symptoms (aMRI_3). The third MRI was taken on the 26th day (range, 1–122 days), on average, after BASS, and then this day was sequentially subdivided into three groups (A: less than 2 weeks, B: 2–4 weeks, C: more than 4 weeks). Then we attempted to determine the critical period when the radiological muscle status was normalized. We also examined the operation time to assess its correlation with muscle status. <h4>Results:</h4> In the aMRI_1, all cases were graded 0. In the aMRI_2, no cases were graded 0, 29 were 1, and 1 was 2. In the aMRI_3, 12 cases were graded 0, 16 were 1, and 2 were 2. No significant differences were identified among the three groups in terms of age, sex, operation level, operation time, aMRI_1, and aMRI_2. However, in aMRI_3, a significant difference was found among the groups (P = .002, Kruskal-Wallis H test), and in the C group, in particular, the grade was significantly low (P = .006, Dunn multiple comparisons test). The average operation time was 111.3 ± 40.0 min (range, 45–210 min) and it was not significantly correlated aMRI_2 or aMRI_3. However, there was a significant negative correlation between the time when the MRI was re-taken and aMRI_3 (P = .0053, rho = −0.495, Spearman correlation test). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Paravertebral muscle injury after BASS was localized to a limited area and spontaneously normalized. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Human spine is composed of physiological curvatures in the sagittal plane. Specific sports practices can modify these curvatures aiming a better adaptation. Non-harmonious changes in the spine sagittal plane increase the risk of spinal pathology. Soccer is the most practiced sport in the world. Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most frequent complaints in professional soccer players, with impact on the quality of training and the final performance. With this work, the authors aim to characterize sagittal balance in professional soccer players, compare them with the general population and establish a relation between the values of sagittal balance and spinal symptoms. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> 37 soccer players of the 1st and 2nd Portuguese Soccer League and 20 individuals from the general population between 18 and 35 years old were recruited. In the clinical and physical activity evaluation were applied the Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 (ODI) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ short-form), respectively. Radiographic evaluation consisted in the interpretation of radiographs of the spine in extra-long film in all participants. Surgimap ® software was used and the following parameters were measured: pelvic incidence (PI), pelvic tilt (PT), sacral slope (SS), sagittal vertical axis (SVA), lumbar lordosis (LL) and thoracic kyphosis (TK). Sagittal balance values were grouped into categories (low, normal, high) according to reference values for the general population. <h4>Results:</h4> Soccer players have lower radiographic values of sagittal balance compared to the control group. However, only the PT has a statistically significant difference and a practical impact (t(55) = −2.64 P = .011 g-Hedge = −0.82). The players subgroup with low PT does not have adaptive values of SS, LL and TK, as verified in the same control subgroup. LBP frequency is higher in soccer players (57% vs. 50%) but a statistical significant difference between the frequency of LBP and changes in the sagittal balance was not confirmed. LBP is more frequent in soccer players when there are changes (increased or decreased values) of PT, LL and TK. The ODI is negligible in both groups (soccer players, ODI = 5%; control group, ODI = 2.3%). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Changes in physiological spinal curvatures are associated with an imbalance in the intervertebral stress distribution. In elite athletes, these changes are particularly important as they can have an impact in the final performance but also because athletes can have targeted functional training in order to prevent injuries. This study characterizes the sagittal balance in a group of soccer players. The reduction of PT verified, which results in the pelvis verticalization, can be explained by the large quadriceps femoris muscle core in this population. The frequency of LBP in soccer players is high when compared to the control group and the overall population (57%, 50%, 25%, respectively) and occurs more when the radiographic sagittal balance values are changed. However, it was not observed any association between radiographic values and low back pain. <h4>Introduction:</h4> The pressure distribution inside the intervertebral disc as well as the footprints of fusion implants remain in the focus of current research. To our knowledge pressure mapping sensors have not been used to provide information about the pressure distribution inside the intervertebral disc. We like to present some of the major abilities and pitfalls utilizing these tools. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> We present a method using a pressure mapping sensor (Model 5033 I-Scan; Tekscan, Boston, MA, USA) in a robot-based in-vitro testing setup with a follower load of 350 N.We used six human specimens (L2–L5). Five groups were tested: 1st intact; 2nd intact & 350 N; 3 rd pressure sensor & 350 N; 4th conventional fusion implant & 350 N; 5th expandable, prototype fusion implant & 350 N. The first and second group were used to define the “intact” status. For the third group a lateral, horizontal incision of the L3-L4 intervertebral disc close to the endplate of L3 was made and the pressure sensor pulled through the disc from one side to the other. The fourth and the fifth group consisted of an LLIF procedure with a conventional and a prototype implant with the pressure sensor between implant and endplate of L3. Both implants were covered with a 0.5 mm thick rubber pad to protect the pressure sensor from the spikes of the implants. The calibration of the pressure sensor was performed with a two-point calibration (100N/400 N) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The range was based on intradiscal pressure values from the literature. <h4>Results:</h4> If ROM of the second group is set to 100%, the horizontal incision through the disc resulted in a median ROM of 98% for EF, 146% for AR and 139% for LB. Although the intervertebral disc was completely cut, it showed excellent equalization of the pressure conducted by the movement of the spine. Only at the end points of each movement high pressure peaks could be observed. For EF these were at the ventral respectively dorsal edge of the intervertebral disc. AR and LB exhibited pressure peaks at the dorsolateral edge of the intervertebral disc. Unfortunately the pressure applied by the implants of the 4th and 5th group exceeded the upper calibration limit. Therefore only contact areas could be observed reliably but the detection of the different footprints succeeded well. Due to high sheer forces during insertion of the implants only 3 sensors of the 4th and 2 sensors of the 5th group remained reasonably intact. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The insertion of the pressure sensor with a transdiscal incision destabilized the motion segment in AR and LB. In EF it remained stable. The pressure peaks in the intact scenario were located at the dorsolateral edge of the intervertebral disc. This location matched the clinical experience of dorsolateral disc protrusion and prolaps. We recommend two different sensor calibrations for intact and implant scenario, as the loads vary highly. The pressure mapping sensor allows excellent detection of footprint and contact area dynamically throughout biomechanical testing. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Myelopathy hand is a characteristic feature of cervical myelopathy. Since there are only a few scales to quantify the severity of cervical compressive myelopathy, there is a need to introduce a universal objective platform in outpatient settings. Virtual-Reality offers promise as a means of producing quantitative data regarding the function of the neural system in the hand. The Leap Motion Controller (LMC) is a small, USB Virtual-Reality motion tracking device that could be used for this purpose. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of the LMC in the 15-second hand grip-and-release (G-R) test, as compared against human inspection of an external digital camera recording. Moreover, to set a baseline measurement of the number of hand flexion-extension cycles and analyse the degree of motion in young healthy individuals, besides examining gender and dominant hand differences. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> Fifty healthy participants were asked to fully grip-and-release their dominant hand as rapidly as possible for three tests, each separated by a 10-minute rest, while wearing a non-metal wrist splint. The first two tests lasted for 15 seconds, and a digital camera was used to film the anterolateral side of the hand on the first test. The third test lasted for a maximum of three minutes or until subjects fatigued. Three assessors counted the frequency of G-R cycles, of the recorded videos, independently and in a blinded fashion. One assessor counted the frequency of grip-and-release cycles as well as the number of motions (magnitude of motion) from the data output of the LMC. The average mean frequency of the three video observers was compared with that measured by LMC using the Bland-Altman method. Test-retest reliability was examined by comparing the two 15-second tests. <h4>Results:</h4> The mean number of G-R cycles recorded in each 15-second test was: 47.8 ± 6.4 (test 1, video observer); 47.7 ± 6.5 (test 1, LMC); and 50.2 ± 6.5 (test 2, LMC). Bland Altman indicated a bias of 0.15 cycles (95%CI = 0.10-0.20), with upper and lower limits of agreement −1.16 and 1.46 cycles, respectively. The ICC showed high inter-rater agreement (ICC = 0.998, 95%CI = 0.997-0.999, P < .01). The coefficient of repeatability for the number of cycles was ±5.393, with a mean bias of 3.63. Over 3 minutes, the frequency of cycles (per 10-second interval) decreased, as did the magnitude of motion. However, the decline in frequency preceded that of motion’s magnitude. Participants reached fatigue from 59.38 seconds; 43 participants were able to complete the 3-minute test. There were no statistically significant differences according to gender or dominant hand at most time intervals (P > .05). <h4>Conclusions:</h4> LMC appears to be valid and reliable in the 15-second grip-and-release test. This serves as a first step toward the development of a universal objective platform for the assessment of cervical myelopathy. Further assessment is warranted to gauge benchmark values in a wider range of healthy individuals and in cervical myelopathy patients. Assessing the LMC as a diagnostic tool in the clinical setting is also necessary. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Spinal deformities are usually associated with poor quality of life (HRQoL). Several questionnaires have been developed to evaluate HRQoL in idiopathic scoliosis (the SRS-24, SRS-22, the SQLI and the EOSQ for early onset scoliosis). Rasch analysis is able to turn ordinal scale measures into interval, with obvious clinical and research advantages. Only the SRS-22, the most widely used questionnaire, has been evaluated with Rasch analysis, but showed poor clinimetric properties after Rasch analysis application. The aim of this study was to develop a new questionnaire (ISYQOL: Italian Spine Youth Quality of Life questionnaire) able to satisfy the fundamental requirement for Rasch analysis, for HRQoL evaluation in adolescents with spinal deformities. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> A multistage classical methodology has been used: content analysis of the posted messages by adolescents with spinal deformities in an internet forum (developed in 2006, including 5758 posts and 1156 answers from expert clinicians), to guide the items selection; an opinion poll among 23 experts provided a first version of the questionnaire, with 50 possible items; test of the first draft of the questionnaire (50 questions) in 94 patients; Rasch analysis to generate the second version of the questionnaire (23 questions) that was tested again in 39 patients; finally, 402 participants filled out the last version of the ISYQOL in the waiting room, immediately before medical evaluation. To analyze the data Rasch analysis was performed by using Winsteps Rasch Measurement software (2009, version 3.69.1; partial credit model). <h4>Results:</h4> We found that 20 items fitted the model and constituted the final version of the ISYQOL questionnaire. Differential Item functioning was significant for brace (−0.87 vs −1.62 logit, respectively; P = .0015), thus allowing comparison among patients with and without brace. The principal component analysis on Rasch residual confirmed the unidimensionality of the ISYQOL. The finding of an addition variable hidden in the ISYQOL Rasch residuals (1st factor Eigenvalue = 2.2) explains 5.2% of the total data variance. Participant reliability of ISYQOL is 0.83 and thus ∼3 significantly different strata can be discerned in the sample. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The present work presents the ISYQOL, the first questionnaire developed in the Rasch setting which measure HRQOL in adolescents with spinal deformity. Being Rasch consistent, ISYQOL offers an HRQOL measure which is additive, generalizable and unidimensional thus complying with requirement of a genuine continuous measure. ISYQOL can offer an insight on the impact of the brace prescription. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Cortical bone trajectory (CBT) technique has been revisited in recent years with regard to its use in instrumenting the osteoporotic spine. This is most relevant in current practice where we are witnessing a rising elderly demographic index. We looked at the theoretical forte of this technique -- its effectiveness in preventing implant loosening. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> From December 2012 till June 2014, 64 adult women underwent lumbar spine decompression and instrumentation using the CBT technique by a single surgeon. They were post-menopausal women with ages ranging from 62 till 92 years old. The surgical indications were for lumbar spine stenosis presenting with radiculopathy. The number of levels operated on ranged from one till four. We excluded patients with metastatic spine disease, infective spine lesions and spondylolisthesis greater than Grade 2. All patients received bi-laminar decompression and 60 had at least one level of interbody fusion. These patients were then followed up for a minimum of 24 months. Of the 64 cases, 3 were lost to follow-up. One patient succumbed to a cerebrovascular event during the follow-up period, another was uncontactable while another declined to be studied. We studied the incidence of loosening with quarterly radiographs in the first year and twice annually in the second, and a CT scan at 12 and 24 months. The films were read and interpreted separately by the author and 2 radiologists, with statistical adjustment of inter-observer variation. <h4>Results:</h4> Five patients suffered screw loosening, 2 of them having it at the sacral level and the remaining, on the cephalad last-instrumented vertebra. Of the 372 screws implanted, 4 sacral and 7 lumbar were loosened. Loosening was detected at time periods ranging from 3 months to 9 month after surgery, and was invariably associated with failure of fusion at that level. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The rates of loosening in our study compare favourably against loosening rates found in classical pedicle screw constructs. Cortical bone trajectory holds the possibility of preventing implant loosening by virtue of its good cortical purchase. Such a likelihood calls for the audit of a larger series to further validate its results. <h4>Disclosure</h4> The author did not receive funds or benefits in any kind pertaining to this subject during the conduct of this study. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Pedicle screw constructs have emerged as the leading method of posterior spinal instrumentation, providing excellent correction of adolescent spinal deformities with stable and rigid fixation. Pedicle screws, however, bring about a unique set of potential complications. As an alternative to all-pedicle screw fixations, hybrid constructs intermittently substituting sublaminar hooks have been reported. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> We analysed a cohort of 77 patients (mean age was 16.7 ± 1.9 years old) with adolescent idiopathic kyphoscoliosis, we classify them according to Lenke classification. We divided patients into two groups: patients treated with all-pedicle screw fixation composed Group A; patients treated with hybrid fixation composed Group B. We retrospectively analysed preoperative and postoperative radiographical findings: cervical, thoracic, lumbar and spino-pelvic indexes were recorded. Average follow-up was 30 months. <h4>Results:</h4> In Group A the mean Cobb angle for the main curve was of 55.78° (±7.4); the mean residual scoliosis after surgery was 15.89° (±14.96). In Group B the mean Cobb angle for the main curve was of 51° (±18.57); the residual scoliosis after surgery was 19° (±16.35). The amount of curve correction of the primary scoliosis curve was statistically significant (P < .001). In the evaluation of the whole groups after surgery, we observed a significant modification of spino-pelvic indexes. The C7PL tends to move posteriorly after surgery. T1 slope, global cervical kyphosis and upper cervical kyphosis were reduced after surgical realignment of the trunk. <h4>Discussion and Conclusions:</h4> The hybrid technique is an excellent adjunct in the correction of spinal deformity in patients with idiopatic scoliosis. Sublaminar bands utilized in a hybrid construct can achieve corrections equivalent to all-pedicle screw constructs. We found an adaptive behavior of the cervical spine in malalignment of the thoracic and lumbar spine. The sagittal alignment of the cervical spine depends on the alignment of the trunk, and improvement in thoracolumbar alignment is followed by reduction of the cervical lordosis. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Gunshot wounds of the spine are not very frequently reported and there is a paucity of neurosurgical literature on the subject. We share our experience of managing 27 patients with thise injuries, sustained in militancy and warlike situations and civilian injuries. <h4>Methods:</h4> Between 1995 and 2015, 27 cases with low velocity missile injuries of the spine and spinal cord were treated in three service hospitals. All were adult males, with a mean age 30.7 years. The wounds were caused by splinters in eighteen (82%) and bullets in four (18%). Twelve patients received more than one splinter. The cervical and thoracic spines were most frequently involved. In seven cases, there were injuries to other organs. There was extensive initial deficit (quadriplegia, paraplegia) in 18 (82%) cases, while four (18%) had partial deficits. The patients were evaluated by spine radiographs; Myelography was done in four, CT myelography in thirteen and MRI in four patients. Two patients had intramedullary haematoma without any skeletal injury, and were treated conservatively. Seventeen patients were treated operatively, and associated injuries of other organs received priority management. Surgery was in the form of debridement, exploration of spinal cord, haemostasis, decompression and dural repair. Steroids and antibiotics were given routinely. <h4>Results:</h4> Three patients (two with cervical and one with thoracic spine injury) died preoperatively, and one (with dorsolumbar injury) died in the postoperative period due to multi-organ injury. Patients with complete injury remained completely paralysed, while those with incomplete injury showed improvement in their neurological grades. Initial neurological grade is the best prognostic indicator, and these injuries are often accompanied by multi-organ injuries. There was no instance of postoperative meningitis or CSF leak. These injuries should be explored for debridement and dural repair. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Gunshot wounds of the spine are infrequent, and in miltiary settings, are routinely explored. Surgery affords debridement, dural reconstruction, prevention of postoperative CSF leaks and infection, and early rehabilitation. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Despite increased focus on patient satisfaction as a measure of healthcare quality, the factors that influence it are incompletely understood. Postoperative pain, pain management, and patient satisfaction with both of these components are important considerations in postoperative patient care. The aims of this study were to determine the relationships between patient reported pain, inpatient pain medication consumption, satisfaction with pain control, and overall satisfaction with inpatient admission following spine surgery. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A retrospective review was performed for all patients with a completed Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey during the study period. Daily averages of patient reported pain using the numerical rating scale (NRS), narcotic usage converted to morphine equivalents, alternative pain medication usage, length of stay, and patient reported satisfaction obtained from HCAHPS surveys were recorded. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate for correlations between these variables. <h4>Results:</h4> Of the 316 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 49.7% of patients reported that their pain was “always” controlled and 73.8% were “satisfied” with the hospital admission based on HCAHPS survey response data. There was no association observed between type or amount of pain medication use, including opioids, and satisfaction with pain control nor with the hospital in the postoperative inpatient admission setting (P > .05). The average NRS scores for patients that were satisfied versus those that were not satisfied was nearly identical (3.16 vs. 3.19, P = .89). The perception that staff did everything to provide pain control was significantly associated with hospital satisfaction (P < .001). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> This study demonstrates that increased narcotic consumption did not correlate with greater pain satisfaction while the perception by patients of the efforts provided by the care team to manage pain did significantly correlate with satisfaction. These results emphasize the importance of open communication and dialogue with patients regarding their experiences and treatment plans while questioning the assumption the provisions of greater amount of narcotics will increase satisfaction. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Spinal cord-level osteotomies are increasingly used for posterior-only kyphosis correction in children. The segmental distribution of correction after pedicle subtraction osteotomies (PSO) in children remains unclear. This is the first study to outline the distribution of kyphosis correction after cord-level PSO in children and evaluates its implications on the neurological safety after osteotomy. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> 15 patients with severe thoracic kyphosis with normal pre-operative neurology undergoing PSO above L1 were included. Average age was 12.3 years (range 7 to 14). Relative sagittal angle correction at the osteotomy and at the adjacent segments, sagittal vertical axis (SVA) and angle of osteotomy was measured utilizing pre & post-operative standing AP & lateral radiographs and measurement software. <h4>Results:</h4> There were no post-operative neurological deficits. Mean pre-op kyphosis was 107.3 degrees (range 93-133) and mean post-op kyphosis was 53.7 degrees. Mean percentage correction of kyphosis was 45.7% (SD = 6.6). The proportion of sagittal plane correction contributed directly by the osteotomy was 49.3 degrees (range 42-55), whereas the adjacent segments cepahlad and caudad contributed a total of 45 degrees of the correction (Apex+1 = 4.5°, Apex+2 = 2.3°, Apex+3 = 1.3°, Apex+4 = 1° and Apex-1 = 5.5°, Apex-2 = 7.8°, Apex-3 = 8.5°, Apex-4 = 7.5°, Apex-5 = 6.8°). Mean relative shift in the SVA was 17.1 mm (pre-op 26.2 to post-op 9.1 mm). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The results document the safety of cord level PSO for severe thoracic kyphosis in children when performed with wide laminectomy in neurologically intact patients. Vertebral segments above and below osteotomy contribute an additional and nearly equal amount of sagittal plane correction to that achieved by osteotomy. Pedicle subtraction osteotomies in children are effective in obtaining sagittal plane correction by focal correction at the level of the PSO and also at adjacent segments of the spine Surgeons can take advantage of the flexibility of the pediatric spine in severe kyphotic deformity correction. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy (DCM) encompasses a spectrum of age-related conditions of the cervical spine, including spondylosis, which result in progressive spinal cord injury through static and dynamic injury mechanisms. Unfortunately, little is known of the prevalence and constellation of anatomical pathology that presents in these patients and if there are differences between genders. Through detailed review of MRIs from prospective AOSpine multicenter studies, it is the purpose of the present research to report on the global prevalence of degenerative cervical pathologies of surgically treated DCM patients. Such information would be potentially helpful in uncovering etiological factors, provide insight into the natural history, and determine risk factors for DCM. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> MRIs of 458 patients were reviewed for the type of pathology, source of stenosis, level of maximum cord compression, levels of spinal cord compression (SCC), and signal changes on T2WI and T1WI. Additionally, a spinal cord occupying ratio (SCOR) within the canal at non-compressed sites was calculated and a SCOR ≥70% was used to identify congenital stenosis. The prevalence of these changes was separated into genders and the proportions were assessed using Chi-square analysis. A P value of ≤.05 was considered as statistically significant. Additionally, the proportion of degenerative changes present alongside other diagnoses was computed as well as the prevalence of pathologies per geographical region. <h4>Results:</h4> Globally, spondylosis was the most frequent cause of SCC (89.7%) and was frequently accompanied by enlargement of the ligamentum flavum (LF) (59.8%), Figure 1. OPLL was accompanied by spondylosis in 91.7%. Single level disc pathology, OPLL and spondylolisthesis had a prevalence of ∼10%. Associated abnormalities such as vertebrae fusion and congenital stenosis were observed in 2.8% and 8.4%, respectively. Single level disc pathology was less common in North America, congenital stenosis less common in Europe, and OPLL more common and spondylolisthesis less common in Asia-Pacific. Females presented more commonly with single level disc pathology (P = .013) and were less likely to have their maximum site of cord compression at C3-4 (P = .007). Males more commonly presented with spondylosis (P = .017) and enlargement of LF (P = .012). Globally, the C5-6 region was the most frequent maximum compressed site (39.7%) and region for T2WI hyperintensity (38.9%). T2WI hyperintensity more commonly presented in males (P < .001). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> DCM presents as a constellation of pathologies that most commonly includes multilevel disc and bone pathologies, as well as enlargement of the LF. These findings support that pathological features, including OPLL, are highly interrelated with one another and rarely present in isolation. There appears to be a number of differences in the frequency and constellation of pathologies between genders. Overall, females presented with milder degenerative changes and correspondingly a lower frequency of T2WI hyperintensity of the spinal cord on MRI. There are also variances in the spectrum and prevalence of pathologies between geographical regions and these may be due to a multitude of causes that likely span beyond ethnic factors. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Low back pain is mainly caused by trauma or disc degeneration. We aim for an “inside-out” approach repair for herniated intervertebral discs (IVD) or injuries of the outer annulus fibrosus by using hydrogel in combination with modified silk. The silk’s fibroin contains the human growth and differentiation factor 6 (GDF6), directly produced by baculovirus transduced Bombyx mori larvae in culture. GDF6 was shown to drive mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) towards an IVD-like phenotype.1 Within this study, we investigated the feasibility of a genipin cross-linked fibrin hydrogel using an ex vivo organ culture approach.2 Furthermore, cytotoxicity and proliferation potential of human MSC within the silk material were assessed. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Bovine IVDs were harvested under aseptic conditions.3 After inducing an IVD injury (2 mm biopsy punch), the cavity was filled with a human-based fibrin hydrogel enhanced with genipin. A GMP-compliant silk membrane-fleece composite was placed on the hydrogel to close the injury. Subsequently, IVDs were subjected to in vitro organ culture for 14 days using three loading regimes: 1) complex (0.2 MPa compression and 0 ± 2° torsion at 0.2 Hz for 8h/day), 2) static diurnal (0.2 MPa) and 3) no loading. For complex loading a custom built two-degree of freedom bioreactor was used.4 At the end of culture, the discs were controlled for seal failure, height, metabolic activity, cell death (necrosis and apoptosis), DNA, GAG and collagen (hydroxyproline) contents. qPCR of ECM production and inflammation was performed. Histologies for collagen, proteoglycan and cytoplasm/nuclei were performed on plastic and cryo-sections. Proliferation potential of GDF6-silk was investigated by seeding MSC (P2) on silk fleece-membrane composite for 21 days. Metabolic activity, DNA and GAG content as well as qPCR (aggrecan, collagen 2, and others) were measured on day 0, 7, 14 and 21. All experiments were performed with N = 5 repeats. <h4>Results:</h4> Macroscopic inspection revealed that the silk seal was not displaced throughout the culture period. Metabolic activity, DNA and GAG content and disc height of the repaired discs did not differ significantly from the injured IVDs. Except for a higher DNA content under static loading for the repaired discs compared to the injured IVDs (P value ≤ .004). Examination of histological sections indicated that the injury created a cavity. Whereas in the repaired discs the induced injury was closed and the cavity was filled with tissue. In vitro experiments on the cellular level attributed a good cell compatibility within the silk and GDF6 silk. Also proliferation, DNA and GAG content did not reveal significant differences among the different silks. qPCR of MSC revealed a trend towards a higher aggrecan to collagen 2 ratio. This ratio indicated a differentiation of MSC towards a nucleus pulposus phenotype. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Strikingly, discs responded equally to the injury on opposite sides, suggesting exchange of cytokines either throughout the disc or the culture media. The in vitro experiments attributed the silk a good biocompatibility. Further, GDF6 silk thrives MSC towards a NP-like phenotype. The silk and the hydrogel offer a promising approach to repair and regenerate the IVD after nucleotomy upon disc herniation. <h4>Acknowledgements</h4> We thank Eva Roth for her help in IVD isolation and biomechanical assays.

In recent years, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) approaches have become increasingly popular for treatment of spinal pathology. There have been prior reports of MIS for ID-EM tumors; however, these have been limited to case reports or small series. Sufficient surgical indications have not yet been thoroughly evaluated. Some controversy has existed concerning the use of unilateral approach for the spinal tumors with foraminal extension or multi-level. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A retrospective analysis of medical records and radiologic data was performed on patients who undergone unilateral laminectomy approaches for the removal of spinal meningiomas and schwannomas by one surgeon in a single center from January 2010 to June 2016. Extradural spinal mass and other ID-EM tumors and patients who followed up loss are excluded. 71 patients were enrolled finally in this study. Schwannomas were 55 cases. Meningiomas were 16 cases. Foraminal extension was found at 20 cases. We investigated the neurologic outcomes, complication rate, gross total removal rate, estimated blood loss (EBL), operation time, hospitalization, recurrence or progression with or without foraminal extension and multi-level. Japanese orthopedic association (JOAS) score, Visual analogue scale (VAS) and McCormick grade were used for the evaluation of postoperative neurologic outcomes. <h4>Results:</h4> The difference of preoperative and postoperative VAS, JOA score and McCormick grade was 4.3 ± 2.9, 1.8 ± 1.3 and 0.4 ± 0.7. These were statistical significance (P = .000). Complication rate was 12 patients; orthostatic headache was detected in 6 patients, wound dehiscence was observed 1 patient, wound infection was found 2 patients and myelopathy was detected 3 patients. Gross total resection was 66.2%, near total resection was 11.3%, subtotal resection was 16.9% and partial decompression was 5.6%. EBL was 235 ± 157.2 cc. Operation time was 210.4 ± 63 mins. Hospitalization was 13.8 ± 7.5 days. Recurrence or progression rate was 4.2%. In subgroup analysis, EBL with foraminal extension (P = .03), operation time with more 2 levels (P = .04) and the difference of preoperative and postoperative VAS with schwannoma (P = .05) was increased significantly. The present study showed significant improvement of VAS in lumbar level and McCormick grade in cervical level more than other levels. There was no severe kyphotic degeneration after laminectomy. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Clinical outcomes of unilateral laminectomy approach for the spinal ID- EM tumors were excellent even in foraminal extension and multi-level cases. The minimal approach does not preclude a low recurrence rate. Unilateral laminectomy approach for patients with relatively short life expectancy would be the good option of surgical approach. That might be also selective option for good general condition and young age patients. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Various factors, including type of bone graft, number of fusion levels, and duration of follow-up, have been reported to influence occurrence of pseudarthrosis after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). However, to our knowledge, there has been no report on the relationships between preoperative radiographic parameters and postoperative pseudarthrosis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether postoperative pseudarthrosis could be predicted according to specific parameters on preoperative plain radiographs, including segmental and global cervical motion and T1 sagittal slope. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> We retrospectively analyzed 84 consecutive patients (male: female = 45:39; mean age, 58.9 ± 11.2 years) who underwent ACDF and were followed for more than 2 years. In all patients, allografts filled with local chip bone were inserted after discectomy and anterior plating was performed. On preoperative plain radiographs, various parameters were measured and analyzed; C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA), T1 sagittal slope, segmental motion, global cervical (C2-C7) motion, segmental interspinous motion, and location of fusion segments. Pseudarthrosis was diagnosed as interspinous motion >1 mm with superjacent interspinous motion ≥4 mm on the magnified plain dynamic lateral radiographs at final follow-up. Multiple logistic regression was performed to analyze the risk factors of pseudarthrosis, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to define a cutoff value. <h4>Results:</h4> Eighty-four patients (1 level in 49, 2 levels in 29, and 3 levels in 6) and 125 segments (4 at C3–4, 31 at C4–5, 55 at C5–6, and 35 at C6–7) were included. The pseudarthrosis rate was 29% based on number of patients (24/84) and 20% based on number of segments (25/125). Multilevel surgery and the lowest cervical fusion level showed a higher pseudarthrosis rate (p = 0.01). In multiple logistic regression analysis, C6–7 segment, greater T1 sagittal slope, and greater segmental motion were associated with a higher risk of pseudarthrosis (P < 0.05, respectively). A cutoff value of segmental motion of 12° demonstrated.pseudarthrosis with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 84%, and area under the curve of 0.899, indicating moderate accuracy. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Greater preoperative segmental motion, greater T1 sagittal slope, and the lowest fusion level (especially C6-7 segment) could be risk factors of pseudarthrosis following ACDF. According to the ROC curve, a preoperative segmental motion >12° is likely to be a clue to predict the development of pseudarthrosis. Surgeons need to be aware of these risk factors which could be detected on preoperative plain radiographs and should consider various supportive procedures to enhance the fusion rate in those cases. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Cervical kyphosis in general is undesirable and places the cervical musculature at a significant biomechanical disadvantage with resultant morbidity and cord compression. Several surgical techniques are described in the treatment of cervical kyphosis but few reports exist analysing the outcomes of treatment. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of a consecutive group of patients with kyphotic deformity of the cervical spine treated at our department with a further emphasis on the surgical approach used (anterior, posterior or combined). <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> We conducted a prospective cohort study of 121 consecutive patients undergoing surgical correction for kyphotic deformity of the cervical spine. 107 patients were available for analysis with a minimum 24 months follow-up. Mean age was 54 years degenerative disease was the commonest cause of kyphosis. Patients with acute injuries, tumors, infections and congenital anomalies were excluded. A stand-alone anterior surgery was performed in 73 patients, a stand-alone posterior surgery in 14 patients and combined two or three step procedures in 20 patients. <h4>Results:</h4> The Neck Disability Index (NDI) improved from a mean of 26.2 preoperatively to 14.4 at two years post- surgery. In 92.5% of cases the value improved or remained un-changed. The mean value in the Nurick system 107 was 0.7 preoperatively and 0.5 at two years after surgery. The VAS mean value for neck and radicular pain changed from 5.9 preoperatively to 2.5 post-operative. If asked whether the patients would undergo the surgery again, 88.2% answered yes, indicating a good patient satisfaction. Of the total number of 107 patients 104 (97.2%) fused at 24 months after surgery. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Surgical correction of the kyphotic deformity resulted in marked improvement of the patients’ quality of life, improvement of the neurological condition and of the spine alignment, as documented by radiological examination of the cervical spine. The best correction was achieved by anterior or combined surgery, although the type of surgery had no impact on clinical outcomes of the patients. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Limited data exists characterizing risk factors for blood transfusion in elective thoracolumbar spine surgery. Additionally, effects of blood transfusion on inpatient outcomes and health care-resource utilization in this population has not been well established. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Utilizing data from the National Inpatient Sample from 2002 to 2012, an estimated 2,483,779 patients undergoing elective thoracolumbar surgery for degenerative conditions or deformity correction were identified. The sample was divided into two cohorts based on whether or not they received a blood transfusion while in the hospital. Risk factors for transfusion, post-operative complications, and health care resource utilization (length of stay, hospital charges, and discharge disposition) were analyzed. Additionally, complications were classified as major or minor. Major complications included acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, septicemia, septic shock, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. Minor complications included deep vein thrombosis, pneumonia, surgical complications, post-operative anemia, and urinary tract infections. <h4>Results:</h4> 290,849 patients (mean age 57.7) received a blood transfusion during their hospitalization and 2,192,930 patients (mean age 57.9) did not; P < .001. Multi-level fusion ≥9 levels was the most important independent risk factor for transfusion (OR 5.28; 95% CI 5.16 to 5.41; P < .001) followed by underlying coagulopathy (OR 2.58; 95% CI 2.51 to 2.66; P < .001) and baseline anemia (OR 2.39; 95% CI 2.36 to 2.43; P < .001). Blood transfusions were strongly associated with inpatient mortality (0.2% versus 0.1%; p < 0.001) and major complications (0.8% versus 2.5%; P < .001) including a greater than two-fold increase in rates of myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, stroke, and pulmonary embolism, and a greater than three-fold increase in rates of septicemia and shock when compared to patients who did not receive a blood transfusion. Blood transfusion status was an independent risk factor for major complications (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.64 to 1.86; P < .001) and inpatient mortality (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.32 to 1.51; P < .001). Patients who received a blood transfusion had longer hospital stays (mean 5.4 compared to 3.3), significantly increased total hospital charges, and were twice as likely to need discharge to a facility other than home (P < .001). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Blood transfusions are associated with poorer inpatient outcomes and a significant increase in consequent health-care resource utilization. Extra efforts should be made to minimize blood loss in those at risk of needing a subsequent blood transfusion following elective spine surgery. <h4>Introduction:</h4> A multi surgeon retrospective review looking at postoperative deep space infections after posterior spinal fusion can be difficult to manage and potentially devastating. The overall rate of infection after posterior spinal fusion has been reported as high as 23% in patients with neuromuscular scoliosis. A multilayered plastic surgery closure decreases potential dead space, protecting the spinal instrumentation. We compared surgically treated neuromuscular scoliosis patients with and without plastic surgery multilayered wound closure. <h4>Materials/Methods:</h4> All neuromuscular scoliosis patients treated with posterior spinal fusion from 2008 to 2014 were analyzed. Patients with 2-year follow-up and completed charts were reviewed. Patients were categorized into 2 Groups: Group 1 [Plastic Closure (PC)] – included patients with a multilayered closure and advancement flaps when necessary; Group 2 - Standard Closure (SC). Differences in demographic, radiographic, and clinical parameters were analyzed. <h4>Results:</h4> 50 patients met inclusion criteria for the database, of which 39 had complete 2-year data. Group 1 had 11 patients, each having a multilayered plastic surgery wound closure. Group 2 included 28 patients who had a standard wound closure. There was no difference in age, male gender, number of levels fused, or postop max coronal Cobb angles between the Groups (Table 1). There was a significant difference in deep space infections (0 vs 7, P = .0057), revision surgeries (0 vs 7, P = .0057), EBL (2425 vs 644 cc, p = 1.46E-06), OR time (467 vs 245 min, p = 1.97E-08), iliac screw fixation (58% v. 21%, P = .022), and preop max coronal Cobb angle (58.29 vs 71.99°, P = .043) in the PC vs SC Groups, respectively. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Plastic surgery closure resulted in a statistically significant decrease in infection and revision surgery rates despite this patient cohort having significant increases in blood loss, operative time, and iliac screw fixation, all of which have been shown to increase the risk of infection. Utilizing a plastic surgery closure can reduce dead space, providing better soft-tissue coverage of the spinal instrumentation reducing infections and revision surgery rates.Table 1.PCSCpN1129Age (yrs)15.2817.390.255Male57%41%0.38# levels fused14.3815.50.197Preop Cobb Max58.29°71.99°0.043Postop Cobb Max26.88°25.13°0.704EBL (ml)24256441.46E-06OR time (min)4672451.97E-08Iliac screw fixation58%21%0.022Deep Space infections070.0057Revision surgery070.0057 <h4>Study Design:</h4> Prospective observational cohort study. <h4>Objective:</h4> To determine the long-term clinical results and prosthesis survival in patients treated with lumbar total disc replacement (TDR). <h4>Summary of Background Data:</h4> Fusion has become the current standard surgical treatment for lumbar degenerative disease. TDR is an alternative treatment that seeks to avoid fusion-related adverse events, specifically adjacent segment disease. <h4>Methods:</h4> Sixty-eight consecutive patients treated with TDR from 2003-2008 were invited to follow-up and complete a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for back and leg pain, the Dallas Pain Questionnaire (DPQ) and the Short Form-36. These surveys were also administered to the subjects prior to their index TDRs. Data on re-operation were collected from the patients’ medical records. <h4>Results:</h4> Fifty-seven (84%) patients were available for follow-up at a mean 10.6 years post-operative (range, 8.1-12.6 years). There was a significant improvement from pre-op to latest follow-up in VAS (6.8 vs 3.2, P < .000) and DPQ (63.2 vs 45.6, P = .000) in the entire cohort. Nineteen patients (33%) had a revision fusion surgery after their index TDR. Patients who had a revision surgery and statistically significant worse outcome scores at last follow-up compared to patients who had no revision. Thirty patients (52.6%) would choose the same treatment again if they were faced with the same problem. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> This study demonstrated significant improvement in long-term clinical outcomes, similar to previously published studies, and 2/3 of the discus prostheses were still functioning at follow-up. However, there is still a lack of well-designed long-term studies, thus requiring further investigation. <h4>Introduction:</h4> The major problems performing a spinal wide resection are the proximity, contiguity, and sometimes invasion of the great vessels, the parenchymatous organs, the chest wall and the central and peripheral nervous system. In children, in addition to all that, we meet the difficulties of choosing the length of the instrumentation, the small size of the pedicles and vertebral bodies, the fragile hemodynamic balance and the management of post-operative pain. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Over the past 12 years we have performed 18 total spondilectomy single or multilevel (one to five vertebrae in en block excision), 6 cervical, 4 thoracic and 8 lumbar, with a resection of a minimum of 2.8 to a maximum of 12 cm. The age of our patients was between 4 and 16 years old with a mean follow-up of 26 months. The pathologies treated were primary aggressive bone lesions: 6 osteosarcomas, 4 Ewing’s sarcoma, 3 malignant high grade schwannomas, 1 leiomyosarcoma, 1 high grade rhabdoid tumor, 1 giant cell tumor (aggressive), 1 chordoma, 1 osteoblastoma osteosarcoma-like. <h4>Results:</h4> We systematically performed a 360° circumferential reconstruction, connecting the anterior artrodesis with the posterior fixation, compressing the entire instrumentation at the end of the surgery. The final stability over the time has been systematically carried out by an anterior interbody fusion between the adjacent vertebrae to the resection, always made with the iliac autograft with which we have filled the different anterior cages used (carbon, titanium, homograft massive bone bank). The choice of the length of the posterior instrumentation was always very difficult, preferring short strumentations, whenever possible, to save spine for future growth. We had a distal junctional kyphosis due to breakage of the instrumentation (successfully re-operated), an distal junctional kyphoscoliosis due to failure of the arthrodesis (successfully re-operated), two neurological worsening (one completely healed, one with only partial recovery), 4 local recurrences (9, 12, 34 and 39 months) with systemic progression of the disease. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The high complication rate in our series is explained by the complexity of this type of surgery in children, which any how permits to obtain satisfactory oncological results. Based on our results we can say that even in pediatric patients with multilevel vertebral primary aggressive tumors it is possible to perform correct oncological resections with a final positive outcome higher than 70%.","<h4>Introduction:</h4> A prior study showed the touched vertebra (TV), defined as the most cephalad thoracolumbar/lumbar vertebra “touched” by the center sacral vertical line (CSVL), as a potential landmark vertebra & recommended lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV) as well. We evaluated a large cohort of Lenke type 1 & 2 cases to determine if selecting the TV as the LIV will produce optimal positioning at a min. 5 yrs postoperative. Our hypothesis was that it would and that fusing short of the TV would lead to a suboptimal result. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> 299 pts with Lenke 1 (n = 207) or Lenke 2 (n = 92) AIS curves at a min. 5 yr f/u were evaluated. The TV was selected on the preoperative x-ray by 2 independent examiners & confirmed for agreement. The LIV selected was compared to the preoperative TV as well as the LIV-CSVL distance at min. 5 yr f/u. Comparison was made on the LIV-CSVL distance in pts fused short of the TV, to the TV or distal to the TV using standard statistical software. <h4>Results:</h4> When comparing the entire cohort, differences in 5 yr LIV-CSVL absolute values between the 3 groups approached, but did not reach, significance (P = .055). In a subanalysis of the lumbar A modifiers (n = 161), main effect ANOVA indicated a significant difference among the 3 groups (P = .002). Post hoc comparison revealed that pts fused short of the TV (TV-1) had significantly greater LIV-CSVL distance values than those fused to the TV (P = .006) & those fused distal to the TV (TV+1, P = .002). There was no significant difference among the 3 groups when looking at lumbar B (n = 76, p = 0.424) & lumbar C (n = 62, P = .326) modifiers. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Selecting the touched vertebra (TV) as the LIV for Lenke type 1A & 2A curves produced optimal LIV positioning at a minimum 5 yrs postoperative, while fusing short of the TV showed statistically increased LIV- CSVL translation. Understanding & utilizing the TV rule assists the surgeon in proper LIV selection in Lenke type 1A & 2A curve patterns for AIS. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Laminoplasty first described by Tsuji in 1982 as an alternative to laminectomy as the treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy CSM. The technique was developed in an effort to eliminate the development of instability and kyphosis following laminectomy while achieving minimal reduction in cervical range of movement (ROM) compare to fusion. In the late 1990’s, spinal surgeons experimented the use of maxillofacial fixation plates as an alternative to sutures, anchors and local spinous process auto-grafts to provide a more rigid and lasting fixation of laminoplasty. This eventually led to the advent of laminoplasty mini-plates, which are currently used. <h4>Objective:</h4> Is to compare laminoplasty with plate and without plate techniques in terms of functional outcome results. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed to evaluate the current available literatures in an attempt to justify the use of plate in laminoplasty. Given the relatively high costs associated with the use of these plates and limited available data in the literatures about laminoplasty techniques and outcome. <h4>Results:</h4> The principal finding of this study was that there was no statistically significant difference in clinical outcome between the two different techniques of Laminoplasty. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> There is no enough evidence in the Literatures to support one technique over the other and hence there is no evidence to support change in practice (using or not using the plate in laminoplasty). Randomized control trial will give better comparison between the two groups. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Some studies have indicated PS fixation at UIV is thought to be a possible risk factor of PJF. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively compare the incidence of acute PJF between transverse hook fixation at UIV and PS following ASD surgery. <h4>Methods:</h4> Forty-seven ASD patients who underwent corrective surgery by a single surgeon were retrospectively reviewed with a minimum 1-year follow-up. The mean age was 67.6 years old (42-83) and the follow-up period was 36.9 months (12-95). T9 as UIV was selected in 17 patients and T10 in 30 patients. Transverse hook was used in 26 patients, and PS was used in 21 patients. Radiographic parameters including SVA, PI-LL, PT, and proximal junctional angle (PJA) were measured before surgery (PreO) and latest follow-up period (PO). Fracture risk was also evaluated using FRAX (WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool) before surgery. Acute PJF was defined as UIV and UIV+1 fracture, implant failure or PJK > 15° within the first six months. We compared the several data between the hook group and the PS group with statistical software. <h4>Results:</h4> The hook group had an acute PJF rate of 19.2% compared to 28.5% in the PS group (P = .20). The mechanisms of acute PJF are as follows; there were 4 patients with UIV fracture and 1 patient with implant failures in the hook group, and there were 6patients with UIV fracture in the PS group. Radiographic parameters in the hook group (PreO/PO) were following; SVA; 119.1/39.1 mm, PI-LL; 46.4/4.6°, and PT;35.8/21.9°. Those in the PS group were as follows; SVA; 92.3/37.3 mm, PI-LL; 37.6/4.5°, and PT;31.9/21.8°. FRAX were 13.7% in the hook group and 13.4% in the PS group. There were no differences in baseline data between the two groups. However, the changes of PJA in the PS group were significantly higher than those in the hook group (7.4/2.9°; P = .05). To analyze the PJA data in the patients with Acute PJF, the changes of PJA were significantly higher in the PS group than those in the hook group (17.0/6.3°; P = .04). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Our study doesn’t show that transverse hook as UIV instrument can prevent acute PJF. However, using hook at UIV can prevent the vertebral collapse if UIV fracture occurs. The increased risk of collapse of UIV fracture in the PS group in this study may due to higher mechanical load to UIV using PS. Further biomechanical study should be necessary to clarify our results. <h4>Introduction:</h4> The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of different doses rhBMP-2 on bone healing in an ovine lumbar interbody fusion model. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> In this study 22 sheep underwent two level lumbar interbody fusion using a ventrolateral approach with secondary dorsal fixation at L1/2 and L3/4. After randomization in one level a PEEK-cage was implanted filled with one of three doses rhBMP-2 (0,5 mg; 1 mg; 2 mg) delivered on an ACS. The other level received an empty PEEK-cage or ACS filled cage. Animals were sacrificed after 3 and 6 months and decalcified histology was performed. This included histomorphological analysis as well as histomorphometry of the tissues within the cage. <h4>Results:</h4> At 3 months after surgery the groups treated with rhBMP-2 showed higher amounts of bone tissue within the cage. At 6 months the amounts of bone tissue increased in all groups, but were still lower in the groups without growth factor. At 3 months there was only one active osteolysis in the cage/ACS. 7 of 8 segments of the rhBMP-2 groups had a compromised bone structure around the implant. These areas were filled with fibrous tissue and fibrocartilage. This finding was not detected in the groups without rhBMP-2 at 3 months. At 6 months most of the segments with an empty cage or cage/ACS showed a chronic inflammation. Predominant cells were macrophages and giant cells. The groups treated with rhBMP-2 showed only a few mild chronic inflammatory reactions. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The well-known dose dependent effect of rhBMP-2 on bone healing could also be recognized in our study. Attention has to be payed for the proinflammatory properties of the growth factor. Consistent with other studies we found 2 strong inflammatory reactions, each one in the lowest and highest dose group. Also the potential for causing transient bone resorptions, according to the results of others, was demonstrated. At 3 months 7 of 8 segments treated with rhBMP-2 showed compromised peri-implant bone. Osteoblasts, but not osteoclasts, were seen in the periphery of these areas. It can be concluded that there where bone resorptions which already merged into an increased osteoblastic activity. Usually resorptions occur between 2 and 12 weeks and are followed by a period of increased osteoblastic activity. This finding wasn’t recognized at 6 months anymore. Striking is that at 6 months most of the segments without rhBMP-2 showed a compromised bone structure around the implant with a mild to mainly moderate chronic inflammatory reaction. This cannot be attributed to the growth factor. Also the ACS is degraded at 6 months and is unlikely a possible explanation. Therefore, the cage as a reason must be considered and it has to be questioned whether PEEK is the optimal material for interbody cages. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Treatment options for pediatric cervical injuries include external immobilization and surgical fusion. Differences in the operative vs. non-operative treatment outcomes of different cervical injury locations (atlantoaxial vs. subaxial) has not been adequately addressed among pediatric patients. In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database to compare complication rates for cervical injuries after external fixation or spinal fusion in the pediatric population. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Patients under the age of 18 with a discharge diagnosis of cervical spine fracture without spinal cord injury or cervical spine subluxation were identified in the NIS database. Patients who were treated with internal fixation or external immobilization between 2002-2011 were included for analysis. Patients who did not undergo treatment and patients with unspecified fracture level were excluded. Discharge weights were applied and used to produce national estimates. Outcome data included length of stay, in-hospital mortality, discharge disposition, total hospital charges, and development of in-hospital complications. <h4>Results:</h4> A total of 2,878 pediatric patients with cervical spine injury were identified after application of discharge weights; 1,462 patients (50.8%) with atlantoaxial injury and 1,416 (49.2%) with subaxial spine injury. There were 1,037 atlantoaxial injury patients (70.9%) treated with external immobilization and 425 patients (29.1%) who underwent internal fixation. Significant differences between groups included total charges ($73,786 ± $107,108 for immobilization and $98,158 ± $86,548 for surgery, P = .040), and development of at least one complication (1.9% for immobilization and 6.8% for surgery, P = .029). Mortality (P = .363), length of stay (P = .221) and non-routine discharges (P = .106) were not different between groups. Among patients with subaxial injuries, there were 542 patients treated with external immobilization (38.3%) and 874 patients treated with surgery (61.7%). When comparing external immobilization to surgery for suabxial injury patients, there were no significant differences in sex (68.2% male vs. 65.4%, p = 0.622), primary payer (P = .493), injury mechanism (P = .234), length of stay (6.4 ± 6.7 days vs. 5.5 ± 5.2, P = .196), mortality (P = .430), non-routine discharges (P = .117), complication occurrence (P = .334), or total charges ($69,042 ± $83,614 for external immobilization vs. $83,123 ± $66,491 for surgery, P = .142). Patients with subluxation alone were treated more often with surgical fusion than with external immobilization (2.2% vs. 1.2%, P < .001). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The management of cervical spinal injuries in pediatric patients must be informed by the location of the injury. In patients with atlantoaxial injuries, the lower overall complication rate and decreased cost may warrant initial consideration of external fixation for treatment. Complication rates for subaxial injuries did not vary by treatment in this study, leaving both external immobilization and surgical fusion as two viable options for treatment. These results will help guide clinicians in their treatment decisions and support more cost-effective methods for managing cervical injuries. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Patients undergoing lumbar surgery often have depressive and anxiety symptoms. Long-term effects of surgery on these psychological symptoms have not been rigorously evaluated. This longitudinal study compared pre- and 2-year postoperative psychological symptoms in 276 lumbar surgery patients and assessed whether change in symptoms was associated with success of surgery. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Several days preop patients completed two psychological surveys, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (possible score 0-30, ≥11 is positive screen for depression) and the Spielberg State Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (possible score 20-80, population norms are used for comparison). Patients also completed the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) measuring disability from low back pain (possible score 0-100) and a validated Lumbar Surgery Expectations Survey measuring expected improvement for symptoms, function, and mental health (possible score 0-100). Medical comorbidity was obtained according to a standard index. Two years postop patients again completed the GDS, STAI, and ODI from the perspective of their current condition, and pre- to postop changes in score were calculated. Patients also reported new/worse comorbidity since surgery, and amount of improvement obtained for each expectation from which an overall proportion of expectations fulfilled was calculated (range 0 -1, higher = greater fulfillment). Improvement in GDS and STAI was defined as better psychological well-being. Success of surgery was defined as greater proportion of expectations fulfilled and improvement in ODI scores. <h4>Results:</h4> Mean age was 55 years, 56% were men, 78% had chronic spine conditions, 28% had major comorbidity preop, 19% reported new/worse comorbidity postop. Mean GDS scores were 9.8 (preop), 5.1 (postop), and 4.8 (within-patient change, P < .0001). More improvement in GDS scores was associated with a greater proportion of expectations fulfilled (P < .0001) and greater improvement in ODI scores (p<.0001). 41% preop screened positive for depression versus 16% postop (P < .0001). Compared to those who screened positive, those who screened negative postop had a greater proportion of expectations fulfilled (.33 vs .75, P < .0001), and a greater change in ODI scores (13 vs 34, P < .0001). Mean STAI scores were 40 (preop), 31 (postop), and 9 (within-patient change, P < .0001). More improvement in STAI scores was associated with a greater proportion of expectations fulfilled (P < .0001) and greater improvement in ODI scores (P < .0001). 59% preop had anxiety symptoms above population norms versus 26% postop (P = .002). Compared to those who were above population norms, those who were below population norms postop had a greater proportion of expectations fulfilled (.40 vs .79, P < .0001) and a greater change in ODI scores (15 vs 36, P < .0001). All associates persisted when controlled for pre- and postop comorbidity. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Traditionally, preoperative psychological symptoms have been assessed as predictors of outcomes of lumbar surgery. Our study demonstrated that outcomes of lumbar surgery, in turn, predict postoperative psychological well-being. The strengths of this study are its longitudinal design, use of within-patient change in scores for all measurements, use of patient-centered measurements, and control for pre- and postoperative comorbidity. This study provides evidence that successful lumbar surgery not only improves physical symptoms and function, but also improves psychological well-being. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Surgery involving a microscope or uniportal endoscope is now one of the most common types of minimally invasive spine surgeries performed worldwide. However, the procedure still has drawbacks related to its narrow view, steep learning curve, and technical problems. Recently, many preliminary or technical reports regarding biportal arthroscopic spinal surgery (BASS) have been published and have demonstrated that BASS can resolve these drawbacks. However, it would useful to determine the degree of paravertebral muscle injury after BASS using two portals and saline irrigation during the entire procedure. Therefore, we examined the radiological status of the paravertebral muscles after BASS. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A total of 48 patients were reexamined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to the recurrence of neurological symptoms during the follow-up period after BASS using a unilateral inter-laminar approach between September 2015 and March 2016. Of these, 30 patients diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis or lumbar disc herniation were included in this retrospective study. Patients with more than the two lesions required for surgery, previous lumbar surgery, spinal infections, or who underwent BASS via a trans-foraminal approach were excluded. We assessed the radiologic status of the paravertebral muscles by grading the extension of paravertebral muscle high signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images (0: normal, 1: partial, 2: total). The MR images were checked and graded on three occasions: preoperatively (aMRI_1), at 1 day after surgery (aMRI_2), and at the time the MRI was re-taken due to the recurrence of neurological symptoms (aMRI_3). The third MRI was taken on the 26th day (range, 1–122 days), on average, after BASS, and then this day was sequentially subdivided into three groups (A: less than 2 weeks, B: 2–4 weeks, C: more than 4 weeks). Then we attempted to determine the critical period when the radiological muscle status was normalized. We also examined the operation time to assess its correlation with muscle status. <h4>Results:</h4> In the aMRI_1, all cases were graded 0. In the aMRI_2, no cases were graded 0, 29 were 1, and 1 was 2. In the aMRI_3, 12 cases were graded 0, 16 were 1, and 2 were 2. No significant differences were identified among the three groups in terms of age, sex, operation level, operation time, aMRI_1, and aMRI_2. However, in aMRI_3, a significant difference was found among the groups (P = .002, Kruskal-Wallis H test), and in the C group, in particular, the grade was significantly low (P = .006, Dunn multiple comparisons test). The average operation time was 111.3 ± 40.0 min (range, 45–210 min) and it was not significantly correlated aMRI_2 or aMRI_3. However, there was a significant negative correlation between the time when the MRI was re-taken and aMRI_3 (P = .0053, rho = −0.495, Spearman correlation test). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Paravertebral muscle injury after BASS was localized to a limited area and spontaneously normalized. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Human spine is composed of physiological curvatures in the sagittal plane. Specific sports practices can modify these curvatures aiming a better adaptation. Non-harmonious changes in the spine sagittal plane increase the risk of spinal pathology. Soccer is the most practiced sport in the world. Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most frequent complaints in professional soccer players, with impact on the quality of training and the final performance. With this work, the authors aim to characterize sagittal balance in professional soccer players, compare them with the general population and establish a relation between the values of sagittal balance and spinal symptoms. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> 37 soccer players of the 1st and 2nd Portuguese Soccer League and 20 individuals from the general population between 18 and 35 years old were recruited. In the clinical and physical activity evaluation were applied the Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 (ODI) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ short-form), respectively. Radiographic evaluation consisted in the interpretation of radiographs of the spine in extra-long film in all participants. Surgimap ® software was used and the following parameters were measured: pelvic incidence (PI), pelvic tilt (PT), sacral slope (SS), sagittal vertical axis (SVA), lumbar lordosis (LL) and thoracic kyphosis (TK). Sagittal balance values were grouped into categories (low, normal, high) according to reference values for the general population. <h4>Results:</h4> Soccer players have lower radiographic values of sagittal balance compared to the control group. However, only the PT has a statistically significant difference and a practical impact (t(55) = −2.64 P = .011 g-Hedge = −0.82). The players subgroup with low PT does not have adaptive values of SS, LL and TK, as verified in the same control subgroup. LBP frequency is higher in soccer players (57% vs. 50%) but a statistical significant difference between the frequency of LBP and changes in the sagittal balance was not confirmed. LBP is more frequent in soccer players when there are changes (increased or decreased values) of PT, LL and TK. The ODI is negligible in both groups (soccer players, ODI = 5%; control group, ODI = 2.3%). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Changes in physiological spinal curvatures are associated with an imbalance in the intervertebral stress distribution. In elite athletes, these changes are particularly important as they can have an impact in the final performance but also because athletes can have targeted functional training in order to prevent injuries. This study characterizes the sagittal balance in a group of soccer players. The reduction of PT verified, which results in the pelvis verticalization, can be explained by the large quadriceps femoris muscle core in this population. The frequency of LBP in soccer players is high when compared to the control group and the overall population (57%, 50%, 25%, respectively) and occurs more when the radiographic sagittal balance values are changed. However, it was not observed any association between radiographic values and low back pain. <h4>Introduction:</h4> The pressure distribution inside the intervertebral disc as well as the footprints of fusion implants remain in the focus of current research. To our knowledge pressure mapping sensors have not been used to provide information about the pressure distribution inside the intervertebral disc. We like to present some of the major abilities and pitfalls utilizing these tools. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> We present a method using a pressure mapping sensor (Model 5033 I-Scan; Tekscan, Boston, MA, USA) in a robot-based in-vitro testing setup with a follower load of 350 N.We used six human specimens (L2–L5). Five groups were tested: 1st intact; 2nd intact & 350 N; 3 rd pressure sensor & 350 N; 4th conventional fusion implant & 350 N; 5th expandable, prototype fusion implant & 350 N. The first and second group were used to define the “intact” status. For the third group a lateral, horizontal incision of the L3-L4 intervertebral disc close to the endplate of L3 was made and the pressure sensor pulled through the disc from one side to the other. The fourth and the fifth group consisted of an LLIF procedure with a conventional and a prototype implant with the pressure sensor between implant and endplate of L3. Both implants were covered with a 0.5 mm thick rubber pad to protect the pressure sensor from the spikes of the implants. The calibration of the pressure sensor was performed with a two-point calibration (100N/400 N) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The range was based on intradiscal pressure values from the literature. <h4>Results:</h4> If ROM of the second group is set to 100%, the horizontal incision through the disc resulted in a median ROM of 98% for EF, 146% for AR and 139% for LB. Although the intervertebral disc was completely cut, it showed excellent equalization of the pressure conducted by the movement of the spine. Only at the end points of each movement high pressure peaks could be observed. For EF these were at the ventral respectively dorsal edge of the intervertebral disc. AR and LB exhibited pressure peaks at the dorsolateral edge of the intervertebral disc. Unfortunately the pressure applied by the implants of the 4th and 5th group exceeded the upper calibration limit. Therefore only contact areas could be observed reliably but the detection of the different footprints succeeded well. Due to high sheer forces during insertion of the implants only 3 sensors of the 4th and 2 sensors of the 5th group remained reasonably intact. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The insertion of the pressure sensor with a transdiscal incision destabilized the motion segment in AR and LB. In EF it remained stable. The pressure peaks in the intact scenario were located at the dorsolateral edge of the intervertebral disc. This location matched the clinical experience of dorsolateral disc protrusion and prolaps. We recommend two different sensor calibrations for intact and implant scenario, as the loads vary highly. The pressure mapping sensor allows excellent detection of footprint and contact area dynamically throughout biomechanical testing. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Myelopathy hand is a characteristic feature of cervical myelopathy. Since there are only a few scales to quantify the severity of cervical compressive myelopathy, there is a need to introduce a universal objective platform in outpatient settings. Virtual-Reality offers promise as a means of producing quantitative data regarding the function of the neural system in the hand. The Leap Motion Controller (LMC) is a small, USB Virtual-Reality motion tracking device that could be used for this purpose. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of the LMC in the 15-second hand grip-and-release (G-R) test, as compared against human inspection of an external digital camera recording. Moreover, to set a baseline measurement of the number of hand flexion-extension cycles and analyse the degree of motion in young healthy individuals, besides examining gender and dominant hand differences. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> Fifty healthy participants were asked to fully grip-and-release their dominant hand as rapidly as possible for three tests, each separated by a 10-minute rest, while wearing a non-metal wrist splint. The first two tests lasted for 15 seconds, and a digital camera was used to film the anterolateral side of the hand on the first test. The third test lasted for a maximum of three minutes or until subjects fatigued. Three assessors counted the frequency of G-R cycles, of the recorded videos, independently and in a blinded fashion. One assessor counted the frequency of grip-and-release cycles as well as the number of motions (magnitude of motion) from the data output of the LMC. The average mean frequency of the three video observers was compared with that measured by LMC using the Bland-Altman method. Test-retest reliability was examined by comparing the two 15-second tests. <h4>Results:</h4> The mean number of G-R cycles recorded in each 15-second test was: 47.8 ± 6.4 (test 1, video observer); 47.7 ± 6.5 (test 1, LMC); and 50.2 ± 6.5 (test 2, LMC). Bland Altman indicated a bias of 0.15 cycles (95%CI = 0.10-0.20), with upper and lower limits of agreement −1.16 and 1.46 cycles, respectively. The ICC showed high inter-rater agreement (ICC = 0.998, 95%CI = 0.997-0.999, P < .01). The coefficient of repeatability for the number of cycles was ±5.393, with a mean bias of 3.63. Over 3 minutes, the frequency of cycles (per 10-second interval) decreased, as did the magnitude of motion. However, the decline in frequency preceded that of motion’s magnitude. Participants reached fatigue from 59.38 seconds; 43 participants were able to complete the 3-minute test. There were no statistically significant differences according to gender or dominant hand at most time intervals (P > .05). <h4>Conclusions:</h4> LMC appears to be valid and reliable in the 15-second grip-and-release test. This serves as a first step toward the development of a universal objective platform for the assessment of cervical myelopathy. Further assessment is warranted to gauge benchmark values in a wider range of healthy individuals and in cervical myelopathy patients. Assessing the LMC as a diagnostic tool in the clinical setting is also necessary. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Spinal deformities are usually associated with poor quality of life (HRQoL). Several questionnaires have been developed to evaluate HRQoL in idiopathic scoliosis (the SRS-24, SRS-22, the SQLI and the EOSQ for early onset scoliosis). Rasch analysis is able to turn ordinal scale measures into interval, with obvious clinical and research advantages. Only the SRS-22, the most widely used questionnaire, has been evaluated with Rasch analysis, but showed poor clinimetric properties after Rasch analysis application. The aim of this study was to develop a new questionnaire (ISYQOL: Italian Spine Youth Quality of Life questionnaire) able to satisfy the fundamental requirement for Rasch analysis, for HRQoL evaluation in adolescents with spinal deformities. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> A multistage classical methodology has been used: content analysis of the posted messages by adolescents with spinal deformities in an internet forum (developed in 2006, including 5758 posts and 1156 answers from expert clinicians), to guide the items selection; an opinion poll among 23 experts provided a first version of the questionnaire, with 50 possible items; test of the first draft of the questionnaire (50 questions) in 94 patients; Rasch analysis to generate the second version of the questionnaire (23 questions) that was tested again in 39 patients; finally, 402 participants filled out the last version of the ISYQOL in the waiting room, immediately before medical evaluation. To analyze the data Rasch analysis was performed by using Winsteps Rasch Measurement software (2009, version 3.69.1; partial credit model). <h4>Results:</h4> We found that 20 items fitted the model and constituted the final version of the ISYQOL questionnaire. Differential Item functioning was significant for brace (−0.87 vs −1.62 logit, respectively; P = .0015), thus allowing comparison among patients with and without brace. The principal component analysis on Rasch residual confirmed the unidimensionality of the ISYQOL. The finding of an addition variable hidden in the ISYQOL Rasch residuals (1st factor Eigenvalue = 2.2) explains 5.2% of the total data variance. Participant reliability of ISYQOL is 0.83 and thus ∼3 significantly different strata can be discerned in the sample. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The present work presents the ISYQOL, the first questionnaire developed in the Rasch setting which measure HRQOL in adolescents with spinal deformity. Being Rasch consistent, ISYQOL offers an HRQOL measure which is additive, generalizable and unidimensional thus complying with requirement of a genuine continuous measure. ISYQOL can offer an insight on the impact of the brace prescription. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Cortical bone trajectory (CBT) technique has been revisited in recent years with regard to its use in instrumenting the osteoporotic spine. This is most relevant in current practice where we are witnessing a rising elderly demographic index. We looked at the theoretical forte of this technique -- its effectiveness in preventing implant loosening. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> From December 2012 till June 2014, 64 adult women underwent lumbar spine decompression and instrumentation using the CBT technique by a single surgeon. They were post-menopausal women with ages ranging from 62 till 92 years old. The surgical indications were for lumbar spine stenosis presenting with radiculopathy. The number of levels operated on ranged from one till four. We excluded patients with metastatic spine disease, infective spine lesions and spondylolisthesis greater than Grade 2. All patients received bi-laminar decompression and 60 had at least one level of interbody fusion. These patients were then followed up for a minimum of 24 months. Of the 64 cases, 3 were lost to follow-up. One patient succumbed to a cerebrovascular event during the follow-up period, another was uncontactable while another declined to be studied. We studied the incidence of loosening with quarterly radiographs in the first year and twice annually in the second, and a CT scan at 12 and 24 months. The films were read and interpreted separately by the author and 2 radiologists, with statistical adjustment of inter-observer variation. <h4>Results:</h4> Five patients suffered screw loosening, 2 of them having it at the sacral level and the remaining, on the cephalad last-instrumented vertebra. Of the 372 screws implanted, 4 sacral and 7 lumbar were loosened. Loosening was detected at time periods ranging from 3 months to 9 month after surgery, and was invariably associated with failure of fusion at that level. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The rates of loosening in our study compare favourably against loosening rates found in classical pedicle screw constructs. Cortical bone trajectory holds the possibility of preventing implant loosening by virtue of its good cortical purchase. Such a likelihood calls for the audit of a larger series to further validate its results. <h4>Disclosure</h4> The author did not receive funds or benefits in any kind pertaining to this subject during the conduct of this study. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Pedicle screw constructs have emerged as the leading method of posterior spinal instrumentation, providing excellent correction of adolescent spinal deformities with stable and rigid fixation. Pedicle screws, however, bring about a unique set of potential complications. As an alternative to all-pedicle screw fixations, hybrid constructs intermittently substituting sublaminar hooks have been reported. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> We analysed a cohort of 77 patients (mean age was 16.7 ± 1.9 years old) with adolescent idiopathic kyphoscoliosis, we classify them according to Lenke classification. We divided patients into two groups: patients treated with all-pedicle screw fixation composed Group A; patients treated with hybrid fixation composed Group B. We retrospectively analysed preoperative and postoperative radiographical findings: cervical, thoracic, lumbar and spino-pelvic indexes were recorded. Average follow-up was 30 months. <h4>Results:</h4> In Group A the mean Cobb angle for the main curve was of 55.78° (±7.4); the mean residual scoliosis after surgery was 15.89° (±14.96). In Group B the mean Cobb angle for the main curve was of 51° (±18.57); the residual scoliosis after surgery was 19° (±16.35). The amount of curve correction of the primary scoliosis curve was statistically significant (P < .001). In the evaluation of the whole groups after surgery, we observed a significant modification of spino-pelvic indexes. The C7PL tends to move posteriorly after surgery. T1 slope, global cervical kyphosis and upper cervical kyphosis were reduced after surgical realignment of the trunk. <h4>Discussion and Conclusions:</h4> The hybrid technique is an excellent adjunct in the correction of spinal deformity in patients with idiopatic scoliosis. Sublaminar bands utilized in a hybrid construct can achieve corrections equivalent to all-pedicle screw constructs. We found an adaptive behavior of the cervical spine in malalignment of the thoracic and lumbar spine. The sagittal alignment of the cervical spine depends on the alignment of the trunk, and improvement in thoracolumbar alignment is followed by reduction of the cervical lordosis. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Gunshot wounds of the spine are not very frequently reported and there is a paucity of neurosurgical literature on the subject. We share our experience of managing 27 patients with thise injuries, sustained in militancy and warlike situations and civilian injuries. <h4>Methods:</h4> Between 1995 and 2015, 27 cases with low velocity missile injuries of the spine and spinal cord were treated in three service hospitals. All were adult males, with a mean age 30.7 years. The wounds were caused by splinters in eighteen (82%) and bullets in four (18%). Twelve patients received more than one splinter. The cervical and thoracic spines were most frequently involved. In seven cases, there were injuries to other organs. There was extensive initial deficit (quadriplegia, paraplegia) in 18 (82%) cases, while four (18%) had partial deficits. The patients were evaluated by spine radiographs; Myelography was done in four, CT myelography in thirteen and MRI in four patients. Two patients had intramedullary haematoma without any skeletal injury, and were treated conservatively. Seventeen patients were treated operatively, and associated injuries of other organs received priority management. Surgery was in the form of debridement, exploration of spinal cord, haemostasis, decompression and dural repair. Steroids and antibiotics were given routinely. <h4>Results:</h4> Three patients (two with cervical and one with thoracic spine injury) died preoperatively, and one (with dorsolumbar injury) died in the postoperative period due to multi-organ injury. Patients with complete injury remained completely paralysed, while those with incomplete injury showed improvement in their neurological grades. Initial neurological grade is the best prognostic indicator, and these injuries are often accompanied by multi-organ injuries. There was no instance of postoperative meningitis or CSF leak. These injuries should be explored for debridement and dural repair. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Gunshot wounds of the spine are infrequent, and in miltiary settings, are routinely explored. Surgery affords debridement, dural reconstruction, prevention of postoperative CSF leaks and infection, and early rehabilitation. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Despite increased focus on patient satisfaction as a measure of healthcare quality, the factors that influence it are incompletely understood. Postoperative pain, pain management, and patient satisfaction with both of these components are important considerations in postoperative patient care. The aims of this study were to determine the relationships between patient reported pain, inpatient pain medication consumption, satisfaction with pain control, and overall satisfaction with inpatient admission following spine surgery. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A retrospective review was performed for all patients with a completed Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey during the study period. Daily averages of patient reported pain using the numerical rating scale (NRS), narcotic usage converted to morphine equivalents, alternative pain medication usage, length of stay, and patient reported satisfaction obtained from HCAHPS surveys were recorded. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate for correlations between these variables. <h4>Results:</h4> Of the 316 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 49.7% of patients reported that their pain was “always” controlled and 73.8% were “satisfied” with the hospital admission based on HCAHPS survey response data. There was no association observed between type or amount of pain medication use, including opioids, and satisfaction with pain control nor with the hospital in the postoperative inpatient admission setting (P > .05). The average NRS scores for patients that were satisfied versus those that were not satisfied was nearly identical (3.16 vs. 3.19, P = .89). The perception that staff did everything to provide pain control was significantly associated with hospital satisfaction (P < .001). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> This study demonstrates that increased narcotic consumption did not correlate with greater pain satisfaction while the perception by patients of the efforts provided by the care team to manage pain did significantly correlate with satisfaction. These results emphasize the importance of open communication and dialogue with patients regarding their experiences and treatment plans while questioning the assumption the provisions of greater amount of narcotics will increase satisfaction. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Spinal cord-level osteotomies are increasingly used for posterior-only kyphosis correction in children. The segmental distribution of correction after pedicle subtraction osteotomies (PSO) in children remains unclear. This is the first study to outline the distribution of kyphosis correction after cord-level PSO in children and evaluates its implications on the neurological safety after osteotomy. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> 15 patients with severe thoracic kyphosis with normal pre-operative neurology undergoing PSO above L1 were included. Average age was 12.3 years (range 7 to 14). Relative sagittal angle correction at the osteotomy and at the adjacent segments, sagittal vertical axis (SVA) and angle of osteotomy was measured utilizing pre & post-operative standing AP & lateral radiographs and measurement software. <h4>Results:</h4> There were no post-operative neurological deficits. Mean pre-op kyphosis was 107.3 degrees (range 93-133) and mean post-op kyphosis was 53.7 degrees. Mean percentage correction of kyphosis was 45.7% (SD = 6.6). The proportion of sagittal plane correction contributed directly by the osteotomy was 49.3 degrees (range 42-55), whereas the adjacent segments cepahlad and caudad contributed a total of 45 degrees of the correction (Apex+1 = 4.5°, Apex+2 = 2.3°, Apex+3 = 1.3°, Apex+4 = 1° and Apex-1 = 5.5°, Apex-2 = 7.8°, Apex-3 = 8.5°, Apex-4 = 7.5°, Apex-5 = 6.8°). Mean relative shift in the SVA was 17.1 mm (pre-op 26.2 to post-op 9.1 mm). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The results document the safety of cord level PSO for severe thoracic kyphosis in children when performed with wide laminectomy in neurologically intact patients. Vertebral segments above and below osteotomy contribute an additional and nearly equal amount of sagittal plane correction to that achieved by osteotomy. Pedicle subtraction osteotomies in children are effective in obtaining sagittal plane correction by focal correction at the level of the PSO and also at adjacent segments of the spine Surgeons can take advantage of the flexibility of the pediatric spine in severe kyphotic deformity correction. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy (DCM) encompasses a spectrum of age-related conditions of the cervical spine, including spondylosis, which result in progressive spinal cord injury through static and dynamic injury mechanisms. Unfortunately, little is known of the prevalence and constellation of anatomical pathology that presents in these patients and if there are differences between genders. Through detailed review of MRIs from prospective AOSpine multicenter studies, it is the purpose of the present research to report on the global prevalence of degenerative cervical pathologies of surgically treated DCM patients. Such information would be potentially helpful in uncovering etiological factors, provide insight into the natural history, and determine risk factors for DCM. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> MRIs of 458 patients were reviewed for the type of pathology, source of stenosis, level of maximum cord compression, levels of spinal cord compression (SCC), and signal changes on T2WI and T1WI. Additionally, a spinal cord occupying ratio (SCOR) within the canal at non-compressed sites was calculated and a SCOR ≥70% was used to identify congenital stenosis. The prevalence of these changes was separated into genders and the proportions were assessed using Chi-square analysis. A P value of ≤.05 was considered as statistically significant. Additionally, the proportion of degenerative changes present alongside other diagnoses was computed as well as the prevalence of pathologies per geographical region. <h4>Results:</h4> Globally, spondylosis was the most frequent cause of SCC (89.7%) and was frequently accompanied by enlargement of the ligamentum flavum (LF) (59.8%), Figure 1. OPLL was accompanied by spondylosis in 91.7%. Single level disc pathology, OPLL and spondylolisthesis had a prevalence of ∼10%. Associated abnormalities such as vertebrae fusion and congenital stenosis were observed in 2.8% and 8.4%, respectively. Single level disc pathology was less common in North America, congenital stenosis less common in Europe, and OPLL more common and spondylolisthesis less common in Asia-Pacific. Females presented more commonly with single level disc pathology (P = .013) and were less likely to have their maximum site of cord compression at C3-4 (P = .007). Males more commonly presented with spondylosis (P = .017) and enlargement of LF (P = .012). Globally, the C5-6 region was the most frequent maximum compressed site (39.7%) and region for T2WI hyperintensity (38.9%). T2WI hyperintensity more commonly presented in males (P < .001). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> DCM presents as a constellation of pathologies that most commonly includes multilevel disc and bone pathologies, as well as enlargement of the LF. These findings support that pathological features, including OPLL, are highly interrelated with one another and rarely present in isolation. There appears to be a number of differences in the frequency and constellation of pathologies between genders. Overall, females presented with milder degenerative changes and correspondingly a lower frequency of T2WI hyperintensity of the spinal cord on MRI. There are also variances in the spectrum and prevalence of pathologies between geographical regions and these may be due to a multitude of causes that likely span beyond ethnic factors. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Low back pain is mainly caused by trauma or disc degeneration. We aim for an “inside-out” approach repair for herniated intervertebral discs (IVD) or injuries of the outer annulus fibrosus by using hydrogel in combination with modified silk. The silk’s fibroin contains the human growth and differentiation factor 6 (GDF6), directly produced by baculovirus transduced Bombyx mori larvae in culture. GDF6 was shown to drive mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) towards an IVD-like phenotype.1 Within this study, we investigated the feasibility of a genipin cross-linked fibrin hydrogel using an ex vivo organ culture approach.2 Furthermore, cytotoxicity and proliferation potential of human MSC within the silk material were assessed. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Bovine IVDs were harvested under aseptic conditions.3 After inducing an IVD injury (2 mm biopsy punch), the cavity was filled with a human-based fibrin hydrogel enhanced with genipin. A GMP-compliant silk membrane-fleece composite was placed on the hydrogel to close the injury. Subsequently, IVDs were subjected to in vitro organ culture for 14 days using three loading regimes: 1) complex (0.2 MPa compression and 0 ± 2° torsion at 0.2 Hz for 8h/day), 2) static diurnal (0.2 MPa) and 3) no loading. For complex loading a custom built two-degree of freedom bioreactor was used.4 At the end of culture, the discs were controlled for seal failure, height, metabolic activity, cell death (necrosis and apoptosis), DNA, GAG and collagen (hydroxyproline) contents. qPCR of ECM production and inflammation was performed. Histologies for collagen, proteoglycan and cytoplasm/nuclei were performed on plastic and cryo-sections. Proliferation potential of GDF6-silk was investigated by seeding MSC (P2) on silk fleece-membrane composite for 21 days. Metabolic activity, DNA and GAG content as well as qPCR (aggrecan, collagen 2, and others) were measured on day 0, 7, 14 and 21. All experiments were performed with N = 5 repeats. <h4>Results:</h4> Macroscopic inspection revealed that the silk seal was not displaced throughout the culture period. Metabolic activity, DNA and GAG content and disc height of the repaired discs did not differ significantly from the injured IVDs. Except for a higher DNA content under static loading for the repaired discs compared to the injured IVDs (P value ≤ .004). Examination of histological sections indicated that the injury created a cavity. Whereas in the repaired discs the induced injury was closed and the cavity was filled with tissue. In vitro experiments on the cellular level attributed a good cell compatibility within the silk and GDF6 silk. Also proliferation, DNA and GAG content did not reveal significant differences among the different silks. qPCR of MSC revealed a trend towards a higher aggrecan to collagen 2 ratio. This ratio indicated a differentiation of MSC towards a nucleus pulposus phenotype. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Strikingly, discs responded equally to the injury on opposite sides, suggesting exchange of cytokines either throughout the disc or the culture media. The in vitro experiments attributed the silk a good biocompatibility. Further, GDF6 silk thrives MSC towards a NP-like phenotype. The silk and the hydrogel offer a promising approach to repair and regenerate the IVD after nucleotomy upon disc herniation. <h4>Acknowledgements</h4> We thank Eva Roth for her help in IVD isolation and biomechanical assays.

In recent years, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) approaches have become increasingly popular for treatment of spinal pathology. There have been prior reports of MIS for ID-EM tumors; however, these have been limited to case reports or small series. Sufficient surgical indications have not yet been thoroughly evaluated. Some controversy has existed concerning the use of unilateral approach for the spinal tumors with foraminal extension or multi-level. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A retrospective analysis of medical records and radiologic data was performed on patients who undergone unilateral laminectomy approaches for the removal of spinal meningiomas and schwannomas by one surgeon in a single center from January 2010 to June 2016. Extradural spinal mass and other ID-EM tumors and patients who followed up loss are excluded. 71 patients were enrolled finally in this study. Schwannomas were 55 cases. Meningiomas were 16 cases. Foraminal extension was found at 20 cases. We investigated the neurologic outcomes, complication rate, gross total removal rate, estimated blood loss (EBL), operation time, hospitalization, recurrence or progression with or without foraminal extension and multi-level. Japanese orthopedic association (JOAS) score, Visual analogue scale (VAS) and McCormick grade were used for the evaluation of postoperative neurologic outcomes. <h4>Results:</h4> The difference of preoperative and postoperative VAS, JOA score and McCormick grade was 4.3 ± 2.9, 1.8 ± 1.3 and 0.4 ± 0.7. These were statistical significance (P = .000). Complication rate was 12 patients; orthostatic headache was detected in 6 patients, wound dehiscence was observed 1 patient, wound infection was found 2 patients and myelopathy was detected 3 patients. Gross total resection was 66.2%, near total resection was 11.3%, subtotal resection was 16.9% and partial decompression was 5.6%. EBL was 235 ± 157.2 cc. Operation time was 210.4 ± 63 mins. Hospitalization was 13.8 ± 7.5 days. Recurrence or progression rate was 4.2%. In subgroup analysis, EBL with foraminal extension (P = .03), operation time with more 2 levels (P = .04) and the difference of preoperative and postoperative VAS with schwannoma (P = .05) was increased significantly. The present study showed significant improvement of VAS in lumbar level and McCormick grade in cervical level more than other levels. There was no severe kyphotic degeneration after laminectomy. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Clinical outcomes of unilateral laminectomy approach for the spinal ID- EM tumors were excellent even in foraminal extension and multi-level cases. The minimal approach does not preclude a low recurrence rate. Unilateral laminectomy approach for patients with relatively short life expectancy would be the good option of surgical approach. That might be also selective option for good general condition and young age patients. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Various factors, including type of bone graft, number of fusion levels, and duration of follow-up, have been reported to influence occurrence of pseudarthrosis after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). However, to our knowledge, there has been no report on the relationships between preoperative radiographic parameters and postoperative pseudarthrosis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether postoperative pseudarthrosis could be predicted according to specific parameters on preoperative plain radiographs, including segmental and global cervical motion and T1 sagittal slope. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> We retrospectively analyzed 84 consecutive patients (male: female = 45:39; mean age, 58.9 ± 11.2 years) who underwent ACDF and were followed for more than 2 years. In all patients, allografts filled with local chip bone were inserted after discectomy and anterior plating was performed. On preoperative plain radiographs, various parameters were measured and analyzed; C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA), T1 sagittal slope, segmental motion, global cervical (C2-C7) motion, segmental interspinous motion, and location of fusion segments. Pseudarthrosis was diagnosed as interspinous motion >1 mm with superjacent interspinous motion ≥4 mm on the magnified plain dynamic lateral radiographs at final follow-up. Multiple logistic regression was performed to analyze the risk factors of pseudarthrosis, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to define a cutoff value. <h4>Results:</h4> Eighty-four patients (1 level in 49, 2 levels in 29, and 3 levels in 6) and 125 segments (4 at C3–4, 31 at C4–5, 55 at C5–6, and 35 at C6–7) were included. The pseudarthrosis rate was 29% based on number of patients (24/84) and 20% based on number of segments (25/125). Multilevel surgery and the lowest cervical fusion level showed a higher pseudarthrosis rate (p = 0.01). In multiple logistic regression analysis, C6–7 segment, greater T1 sagittal slope, and greater segmental motion were associated with a higher risk of pseudarthrosis (P < 0.05, respectively). A cutoff value of segmental motion of 12° demonstrated.pseudarthrosis with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 84%, and area under the curve of 0.899, indicating moderate accuracy. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Greater preoperative segmental motion, greater T1 sagittal slope, and the lowest fusion level (especially C6-7 segment) could be risk factors of pseudarthrosis following ACDF. According to the ROC curve, a preoperative segmental motion >12° is likely to be a clue to predict the development of pseudarthrosis. Surgeons need to be aware of these risk factors which could be detected on preoperative plain radiographs and should consider various supportive procedures to enhance the fusion rate in those cases. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Cervical kyphosis in general is undesirable and places the cervical musculature at a significant biomechanical disadvantage with resultant morbidity and cord compression. Several surgical techniques are described in the treatment of cervical kyphosis but few reports exist analysing the outcomes of treatment. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of a consecutive group of patients with kyphotic deformity of the cervical spine treated at our department with a further emphasis on the surgical approach used (anterior, posterior or combined). <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> We conducted a prospective cohort study of 121 consecutive patients undergoing surgical correction for kyphotic deformity of the cervical spine. 107 patients were available for analysis with a minimum 24 months follow-up. Mean age was 54 years degenerative disease was the commonest cause of kyphosis. Patients with acute injuries, tumors, infections and congenital anomalies were excluded. A stand-alone anterior surgery was performed in 73 patients, a stand-alone posterior surgery in 14 patients and combined two or three step procedures in 20 patients. <h4>Results:</h4> The Neck Disability Index (NDI) improved from a mean of 26.2 preoperatively to 14.4 at two years post- surgery. In 92.5% of cases the value improved or remained un-changed. The mean value in the Nurick system 107 was 0.7 preoperatively and 0.5 at two years after surgery. The VAS mean value for neck and radicular pain changed from 5.9 preoperatively to 2.5 post-operative. If asked whether the patients would undergo the surgery again, 88.2% answered yes, indicating a good patient satisfaction. Of the total number of 107 patients 104 (97.2%) fused at 24 months after surgery. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Surgical correction of the kyphotic deformity resulted in marked improvement of the patients’ quality of life, improvement of the neurological condition and of the spine alignment, as documented by radiological examination of the cervical spine. The best correction was achieved by anterior or combined surgery, although the type of surgery had no impact on clinical outcomes of the patients. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Limited data exists characterizing risk factors for blood transfusion in elective thoracolumbar spine surgery. Additionally, effects of blood transfusion on inpatient outcomes and health care-resource utilization in this population has not been well established. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Utilizing data from the National Inpatient Sample from 2002 to 2012, an estimated 2,483,779 patients undergoing elective thoracolumbar surgery for degenerative conditions or deformity correction were identified. The sample was divided into two cohorts based on whether or not they received a blood transfusion while in the hospital. Risk factors for transfusion, post-operative complications, and health care resource utilization (length of stay, hospital charges, and discharge disposition) were analyzed. Additionally, complications were classified as major or minor. Major complications included acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, septicemia, septic shock, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. Minor complications included deep vein thrombosis, pneumonia, surgical complications, post-operative anemia, and urinary tract infections. <h4>Results:</h4> 290,849 patients (mean age 57.7) received a blood transfusion during their hospitalization and 2,192,930 patients (mean age 57.9) did not; P < .001. Multi-level fusion ≥9 levels was the most important independent risk factor for transfusion (OR 5.28; 95% CI 5.16 to 5.41; P < .001) followed by underlying coagulopathy (OR 2.58; 95% CI 2.51 to 2.66; P < .001) and baseline anemia (OR 2.39; 95% CI 2.36 to 2.43; P < .001). Blood transfusions were strongly associated with inpatient mortality (0.2% versus 0.1%; p < 0.001) and major complications (0.8% versus 2.5%; P < .001) including a greater than two-fold increase in rates of myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, stroke, and pulmonary embolism, and a greater than three-fold increase in rates of septicemia and shock when compared to patients who did not receive a blood transfusion. Blood transfusion status was an independent risk factor for major complications (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.64 to 1.86; P < .001) and inpatient mortality (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.32 to 1.51; P < .001). Patients who received a blood transfusion had longer hospital stays (mean 5.4 compared to 3.3), significantly increased total hospital charges, and were twice as likely to need discharge to a facility other than home (P < .001). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Blood transfusions are associated with poorer inpatient outcomes and a significant increase in consequent health-care resource utilization. Extra efforts should be made to minimize blood loss in those at risk of needing a subsequent blood transfusion following elective spine surgery. <h4>Introduction:</h4> A multi surgeon retrospective review looking at postoperative deep space infections after posterior spinal fusion can be difficult to manage and potentially devastating. The overall rate of infection after posterior spinal fusion has been reported as high as 23% in patients with neuromuscular scoliosis. A multilayered plastic surgery closure decreases potential dead space, protecting the spinal instrumentation. We compared surgically treated neuromuscular scoliosis patients with and without plastic surgery multilayered wound closure. <h4>Materials/Methods:</h4> All neuromuscular scoliosis patients treated with posterior spinal fusion from 2008 to 2014 were analyzed. Patients with 2-year follow-up and completed charts were reviewed. Patients were categorized into 2 Groups: Group 1 [Plastic Closure (PC)] – included patients with a multilayered closure and advancement flaps when necessary; Group 2 - Standard Closure (SC). Differences in demographic, radiographic, and clinical parameters were analyzed. <h4>Results:</h4> 50 patients met inclusion criteria for the database, of which 39 had complete 2-year data. Group 1 had 11 patients, each having a multilayered plastic surgery wound closure. Group 2 included 28 patients who had a standard wound closure. There was no difference in age, male gender, number of levels fused, or postop max coronal Cobb angles between the Groups (Table 1). There was a significant difference in deep space infections (0 vs 7, P = .0057), revision surgeries (0 vs 7, P = .0057), EBL (2425 vs 644 cc, p = 1.46E-06), OR time (467 vs 245 min, p = 1.97E-08), iliac screw fixation (58% v. 21%, P = .022), and preop max coronal Cobb angle (58.29 vs 71.99°, P = .043) in the PC vs SC Groups, respectively. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Plastic surgery closure resulted in a statistically significant decrease in infection and revision surgery rates despite this patient cohort having significant increases in blood loss, operative time, and iliac screw fixation, all of which have been shown to increase the risk of infection. Utilizing a plastic surgery closure can reduce dead space, providing better soft-tissue coverage of the spinal instrumentation reducing infections and revision surgery rates.Table 1.PCSCpN1129Age (yrs)15.2817.390.255Male57%41%0.38# levels fused14.3815.50.197Preop Cobb Max58.29°71.99°0.043Postop Cobb Max26.88°25.13°0.704EBL (ml)24256441.46E-06OR time (min)4672451.97E-08Iliac screw fixation58%21%0.022Deep Space infections070.0057Revision surgery070.0057 <h4>Study Design:</h4> Prospective observational cohort study. <h4>Objective:</h4> To determine the long-term clinical results and prosthesis survival in patients treated with lumbar total disc replacement (TDR). <h4>Summary of Background Data:</h4> Fusion has become the current standard surgical treatment for lumbar degenerative disease. TDR is an alternative treatment that seeks to avoid fusion-related adverse events, specifically adjacent segment disease. <h4>Methods:</h4> Sixty-eight consecutive patients treated with TDR from 2003-2008 were invited to follow-up and complete a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for back and leg pain, the Dallas Pain Questionnaire (DPQ) and the Short Form-36. These surveys were also administered to the subjects prior to their index TDRs. Data on re-operation were collected from the patients’ medical records. <h4>Results:</h4> Fifty-seven (84%) patients were available for follow-up at a mean 10.6 years post-operative (range, 8.1-12.6 years). There was a significant improvement from pre-op to latest follow-up in VAS (6.8 vs 3.2, P < .000) and DPQ (63.2 vs 45.6, P = .000) in the entire cohort. Nineteen patients (33%) had a revision fusion surgery after their index TDR. Patients who had a revision surgery and statistically significant worse outcome scores at last follow-up compared to patients who had no revision. Thirty patients (52.6%) would choose the same treatment again if they were faced with the same problem. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> This study demonstrated significant improvement in long-term clinical outcomes, similar to previously published studies, and 2/3 of the discus prostheses were still functioning at follow-up. However, there is still a lack of well-designed long-term studies, thus requiring further investigation. <h4>Introduction:</h4> The major problems performing a spinal wide resection are the proximity, contiguity, and sometimes invasion of the great vessels, the parenchymatous organs, the chest wall and the central and peripheral nervous system. In children, in addition to all that, we meet the difficulties of choosing the length of the instrumentation, the small size of the pedicles and vertebral bodies, the fragile hemodynamic balance and the management of post-operative pain. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Over the past 12 years we have performed 18 total spondilectomy single or multilevel (one to five vertebrae in en block excision), 6 cervical, 4 thoracic and 8 lumbar, with a resection of a minimum of 2.8 to a maximum of 12 cm. The age of our patients was between 4 and 16 years old with a mean follow-up of 26 months. The pathologies treated were primary aggressive bone lesions: 6 osteosarcomas, 4 Ewing’s sarcoma, 3 malignant high grade schwannomas, 1 leiomyosarcoma, 1 high grade rhabdoid tumor, 1 giant cell tumor (aggressive), 1 chordoma, 1 osteoblastoma osteosarcoma-like. <h4>Results:</h4> We systematically performed a 360° circumferential reconstruction, connecting the anterior artrodesis with the posterior fixation, compressing the entire instrumentation at the end of the surgery. The final stability over the time has been systematically carried out by an anterior interbody fusion between the adjacent vertebrae to the resection, always made with the iliac autograft with which we have filled the different anterior cages used (carbon, titanium, homograft massive bone bank). The choice of the length of the posterior instrumentation was always very difficult, preferring short strumentations, whenever possible, to save spine for future growth. We had a distal junctional kyphosis due to breakage of the instrumentation (successfully re-operated), an distal junctional kyphoscoliosis due to failure of the arthrodesis (successfully re-operated), two neurological worsening (one completely healed, one with only partial recovery), 4 local recurrences (9, 12, 34 and 39 months) with systemic progression of the disease. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The high complication rate in our series is explained by the complexity of this type of surgery in children, which any how permits to obtain satisfactory oncological results. Based on our results we can say that even in pediatric patients with multilevel vertebral primary aggressive tumors it is possible to perform correct oncological resections with a final positive outcome higher than 70%.",EuropePMC
